Darnell Rubio


Landlord



 
Elizabeth Charette (EC), Caroline
Clifford (CC), Aidan Duggan (AD), Myles Fox (MF), Aidan Hall (AH) and Dylan Lown (DL) (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Darnell Rubio (the
'Landlord') or the Landlord's superintendent/Landlord's agent substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential
complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on December 22, 2020.
The Tenants, the Landlord
and the Landlord's Legal Representative Lisa Barder attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant application alleges
that the Landlord did not maintain the rental unit fit for habitation and/or
comply with health
standards relating to the condition of the unit when
the Tenant(s) chose to move-in and the Landlord failed to effect repairs
promptly, resulting in substantially interfering with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants.
 
Background
 
1.    The residential complex
is a house rented out to students. The Tenant(s) took possession of the rental unit on May 1,
2020.
 
2.    The Tenant (AD) testified that the state of
cleanliness was in such poor condition when they took possession of the
residential complex/rental units, that they undertook themselves to clean and
prepare the entire rental unit, before occupancy. The Tenant raised this with the Landlord upon moving in and the Landlord
did not respond responsibly
or timely.




 
 
 
3.   
The Tenant(s) at their own expense
removed the garbage/debris left by the previous Tenant(s) and to clean the residential complex and is seeking $2,000.00 in compensation.
 
Analysis
 
4.    Section 20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
states:
A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
including the rental units in
it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
 
5.    “Good state of repair” requires
that anything that is broken
or damaged, be repaired. “Fit
for habitation” means that the premises
must be in compliance with health, safety,
housing and maintenance standards.
 
6.    Section 22 of the Act states:
A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s
occupancy of a rental unit and before the
day on which an order evicting the tenant is executed substantially interfere
with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential
complex in which it is located for all usual purposes by a tenant or
members of his or her household.
 
7.    The Tenants (as applicant) bear the burden
of proof. The standard of proof in proceedings
before the Board is “proof on a balance of probabilities.” By that standard,
the party bearing the burden of proof must show with evidence that, “more
likely than not”, their assertions are true.
 
8.    The Tenant submitted a number of photographs of the
condition of the rental unit and
exterior yard on May 1, 2020.
 
9.   
When a rental unit or residential complex is deemed not in a good state of repair, a landlord is in breach of the Act.
 
10. Subsection 20(1) of the Act does not contain an element of fault.
Basically, the reason for the breach
is not relevant in determining if a breach occurred.
 
11. Based on the testimonies of the parties
and the evidence submitted, I am satisfied that the Landlord has
breached section 20(1) of the Act.
 
12. I find that the Landlord
did not prepare the rental
unit for a new Tenant
in a manner that a reasonable and prudent Landlord would by
ensuring its cleanliness before renting.
 
13. Therefore, based on the above, I find that the
Landlords substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household
by not preparing the rental
unit for a new Tenant
in a manner that a reasonable and prudent Landlord
would by ensuring
its cleanliness before renting.




 
14. As a result of the Landlord’s failure,
the Tenant is entitled to the following remedies as compensation.
a)    
out -of-pocket compensation to recover removal
of garbage/debris and cleaning
supplies totaling $1,274.22 as outlined
I.       
$1,125.48 Invoice from 1-800-Jot Junk
II.        
$149.74 from miscellaneous paid receipts for cleaning supplies
only
 
15. Other repair costs and hotel
claims are denied.
 
16. The order shall be a
reminder to the Landlords of
their responsible to provier and maintain
a residential complex, and the rental unit in
it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health,
safety, housing and maintenance standards pursuant to section 20(1) of the
Residential Tenancy Act.
 
17. This order contains
all the reasons
for the decisions within the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
$1,274.22 which is the reasonable out of pocket expenses the Tenants have incurred
as identified above.
 
2.    
The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants the $48.00 cost for the application fee.
 
3.    
The Landlord shall pay the Tenants the full amount
owing* by February
15, 2022.
 
4.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February
15, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2020
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants the full amount
owing by February
15, 2022, the Tenant may recover this amount by
deducting from the rent each month until the total balance outstanding is paid
in full.
 
6.    
The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
