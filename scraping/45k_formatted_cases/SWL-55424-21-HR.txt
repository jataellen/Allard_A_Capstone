Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenants




 


Adam Sharp Lisa McDonald


 



 
 
 
Devon Brown
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lisa McDonald
and Adam Sharp (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on August 30, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-53972-21.
 
The Landlord's
application was heard by video conference on January 28, 2022. The Landlord,
Devon Brown, and the Tenant, Lisa McDonald attended the hearing. The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing and attended on behalf of both
Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021
to January 31, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 16,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,850.00.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $8,710.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenants failed to meet several
conditions specified in the order issued by the Board on August 30, 2021 with
respect to application SWL-53972-21.The Tenant testified that she was unable to
keep up with the payments she agreed to make.




File Number:
SWL-55424-21-HR
 
6.    
The Tenants moved into the rental
unit in April 2021 and has a household income
of
$4,000.00 but failed to comply with order SWL-53972-21 because of other financial commitments.
 
7.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $500.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenants for the period from March 6, 2021 to August 16, 2021.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until March 4, 2022 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given
to the Tenants to either secure alternative accommodation or pay the
outstanding amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $5,588.88*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to February 10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the
Landlords $60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before March 4, 2022, then starting March 5, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlords, on or after March 5, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$7,426.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,276.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the




File Number:
SWL-55424-21-HR
 
appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
