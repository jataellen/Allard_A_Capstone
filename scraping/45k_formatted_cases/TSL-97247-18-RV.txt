Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-97247-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
#.O.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict G.F
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-97247-18 issued on August 31, 2018.
 
On
October 4, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order, and that the order
be stayed until the request to review is resolved.
 
On
October 4, 2018, order TSL-97247-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued
on August 31, 2018.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on October 25, 2018.
 
The
Landlord’s legal representative, D.R, the Tenant, and the Tenant’s representative,
L.K, attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
Review
1.      The
Tenant testified that he had never received the Notice of Hearing.  The Board’s
own file has no confirmation that the Notice of Hearing was mailed.  The
Landlord indicated that on that basis he would not further oppose the request
to review. The request to review is granted.  


Landlord’s
Application
2.      The
Tenant acknowledged he has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for
the period from June 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 9, 2018.
3.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
4.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $902.76.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $650.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2016
to July 9, 2018.
7.      The
Tenant paid $942.76 after the application was filed.
8.      The
Tenant testified that there was no possibility of him being able to comply with
a conditional order requiring additional payments each month to pay off the
arrears owed.  
9.      The
Tenant and Landlord agreed that the Tenant’s rent is paid directly to the
Landlord by two social services.  One of the services stopped their payments
because income tax documentation was required from the Tenant.  The Tenant
confirmed that he is taking steps to provide the information necessary and is
keeping in regular touch with the workers who are assisting him.  
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until December 31,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act on the basis that the
Tenant needs time to resolve the issues with the social service providers, and
is not able or willing to enter into a conditional order to pay the arrears.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order TSL-97247-18 issued on August 31, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following order.
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before December 31, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,235.92*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to November 1, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.68 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting November 2, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 31, 2018, then starting January
1, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 1,
2019.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,938.28 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $3,841.04 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after January 1, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   Due
to the Canada Post strike, the Landlord, upon receipt of this order must give a
copy of this order to the Tenant by a method set out in subsection 191(1) of
the Act, other than by sending it by mail or courier to the last known address
where the Tenant resides or carries on business.
