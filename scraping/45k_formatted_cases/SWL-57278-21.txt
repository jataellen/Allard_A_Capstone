Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57278-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1245 CENTRAL AVENUE WINDSOR ON N8Y3V1


 




Between:


Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennive
  Rowe


Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jennive Rowe (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the
Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on October 28, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-54547-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Board issued a settlement agreement
pertaining to file number SWL-54547-21-SA on October
28, 2021 which required the Tenant to make regularly
scheduled payments to the Landlord that were to be applied
against outstanding rental arrears. The agreement also required the Tenant
to continue making
payments of lawful
rent for each consecutive
month in full, and on time for each corresponding month beginning on November
2021 through to February 2022.
 
2.    
The agreement provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain
conditions specified in the order.
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection 78(5)
of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the
breach of the order.
 
4.    
Within the subject L4 application the Landlord claims
that the Tenant had not met the following condition as set out in the
order:
 
▪  The lawful monthly
rent of $750.00 due on November 1, 2021 was paid in part,
leaving an outstanding amount of $300.00
 
5.    
The Landlord’s
application was received by the Board on December 2, 2021, which, pursuant to ss. 78 (5) of the Act, is more than 30 days after the Tenant failed
to meet a




File Number: SWL-57278-21
 
condition set out in the settlement agreement SWL-54547-21-SA
dated October 28, 2021. The first alleged breach would have been in relation to this November
1, 2021 lawful monthly rental
payment.
 
6.    
The Board
does not have jurisdiction to consider this application as it was filed beyond the statutory 30-day period after
the alleged breach had taken place.
 
7.    
Furthermore, and
pursuant to subsection 78(2) of the Act, an application made under section 78
requires the Landlord to include with the application an affidavit setting out
what the conditions of the settlement or order that have not been met are, and
how they have not been met.
Section 78(4) of the Act outlines the information to be captured
in the affidavit in
circumstances when a Landlord requests an order for payment, as had been the
case in the subject application.
 
8.    
Within the application, a declaration was provided by the Landlord’s legal representative,
paralegal Cameron Parrott, but not an affidavit or declaration by the Landlord
as is statutorily required when filing an application under section 78.
Moreover, the content of the declaration does not contain the mandatorily
required information.
 
9.    
As the Landlord’s application does not meet the statutory requirements under
subsections 78(2), (4) and (5) of the Act, the application is dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
