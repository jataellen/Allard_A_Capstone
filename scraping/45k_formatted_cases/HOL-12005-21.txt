Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: HOL-12005-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
72, 1096 c JALNA BOULEVARD LONDON ON N6E3B6


 




Between:


Iftikhar Ahmad


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ekow Wilson


Tenant



 
 
 
Iftikhar Ahmad (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ekow Wilson (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Carmen Dawdy, and the Landlord attended the hearing. The
Landlord’s girlfriend, Saba Shah, was also present prepared to attend as a
witness. As of 1:31 p.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
For the reasons set out below,
I have granted the Landlord’s application for eviction.
 
2.       
On September 9, 2021, the Landlord
served an N12 Notice of Termination (the “N12 Notice”) on the Tenant.
The N12 Notice provides the Landlord’s child intends to move into the rental unit and occupy it for at
least one year. The date of termination was November 30, 2021.
 
Disclosure of prior N12 and N13 notices:
 
3.       
Section 71.1(3) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), which came into force on September 1, 2021,
requires the Landlord
to provide certain information about all N12 and
N13 notices served in the previous two years with the Landlord’s application. If this is
not done, sub-section 71.1(4) of the Act provides the Board must refuse to
accept the application.




 
4.       
The Landlord’s application was
filed on September 13, 2021. By endorsement dated December 1, 2021, the Landlord was ordered to provide information about previous N12 and N13 notices by December 8, 2021.
 
5.       
The Board’s records indicate
the Landlord complied
with the endorsement by submitting the
required materials on December 8, 2021. Further, the Board’s records show that
when the Tenant was served with the Notice of Hearing the application package
and other information was included.
 
Effect of failure to disclose all N12s
 
6.       
In Part “C” of Schedule “B” to the
Landlord’s application, the Landlord advised an N12 was served with respect
to the same rental unit on June 25, 2021 resulting in application
HOL-11003-21.
 
7.       
Review of the Order in HOL-11003-21 indicates a second
‘amended’ N12 was served on or around the same date with a
corrected termination date. However, arguably the Landlord only disclosed one
N12 in their application.
 
8.       
A
similar issue was recently raised
in application TNL-36369-21. Vice-Chair Ian Speers there addressed the purpose of
Section 71.1(3) of the Act as follows:
 
…the apparent intention of this
statutory amendment is to allow both tenants and the Board to observe a pattern
in a landlord’s conduct of using N12 and N13 notices, I believe that the disclosure of all N12 and
N13 notices, valid or not, is the legislative intent of the provision. This legislative intent is underscored
by the contemporaneous proclamation of subsection 72(3) of the Act, which
expressly contemplates that “the Board may consider any evidence the Board
considers relevant that relates to the landlord’s or purchaser’s previous use
of notices of termination under section 48, 49 or 50.”
 
…
 
The Act does not provide a clear
consequence for a landlord’s failure to meet their disclosure obligation under
subsection 71.1(3). Subsection 71.1(4) provides that “The Board shall refuse to accept the application for filing if the landlord has not complied
with subsection (3)”, but does not expressly address what happens when
the Landlord has completed the appropriate section of the application, but has omitted
one or more N12 or N13 notices. The position of the
Tenant’s representative is that the application ought to be dismissed based on
the defect.
 
9.       
As did Vice-Chair Speers
in TNL-36369-21, I accept that, in certain
circumstances, where there is
non-compliance with subsection 71.1(3) the application may be dismissed.
However, in the circumstances of this application
the Landlord completed disclosure prior to service of the Tenant, and the
Tenant was aware of both N12s.
 
10.    I find the Tenant was not prejudiced in their ability
to investigate patterns
in the Landlord’s use of N12 and N13 notices. Nor, had they chosen to attend, were they prejudiced in their




 
ability to argue that any pattern
undermined the good faith of the Landlord’s service of the within N12 Notice.
 
11.    As a result,
I find the Landlord has complied with their obligations under section 71.1.
 
Good faith intention to reside in the rental unit for one year
 
12.   
Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I find the Landlord in good faith requires the rental unit for
residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
13.    The Landlord has a 16-month old son with his
girlfriend of many years. His girlfriend, and mother of his son, currently live
in a one-bedroom apartment with the girlfriend’s other child who is 13 years
old. The Landlord testified that moving into the rental unit would give them, meaning
his girlfriend and her sons,
including his son, more space.
In addition, he testified
this would save them money as they would not pay him rent.
 
14.   
This accords with the affidavit
sworn by the Landlord’s girlfriend, Saba Shah, dated June 25, 2021. That affidavit
also provides the Landlord’s girlfriend requires more room as
she now has two children, will be moving
for financial reasons,
and intends to make the rental
unit her permanent residence for more than one year.
 
15.    The earlier resulting application discussed above,
HOL-11003-21, was dismissed as the first N12 was defective. The Board’s records
indicate the current
application was first filed
four days after application HOL-11003-21 was heard.
 
16.   
I
find the dismissal
of the earlier application, HOL-11003-21, because the earlier
N12 was defective (and a
second N12 served on the same day was confusing), does not undermine the
evidence respecting the genuine intention for the Landlord’s son to move into
the rental unit for a period of one year.
 
Compensation
 
17.   
The Landlord testified he paid the
Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on August 27, 2021 when he left a cheque
for the Tenant in the Tenant’s mailbox.
This was prior to the
termination date in the N12 Notice. As a result, I find the Landlord has
satisfied their obligation under section 48.1 of the Act.
 
18.    The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $880.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
19.    The Landlord seeks an order for eviction.
 
20.    The Landlord advised
the relationship with the Tenant
is challenging. The Landlord was not aware why the Tenant was not present and advised they have not had
contact with them. The Landlord was not aware of any reasons to delay or deny
eviction.




 
21.   
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative advised there is also an outstanding application against the Tenant for arrears and it
was their intention
to address the rent deposit
in that proceeding.
 
22.    I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
22, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 22, 2022, then starting February
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 23, 2022.
