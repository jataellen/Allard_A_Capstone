Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12377-21



In the matter of:


115 LARKINLEY LANE AJAX ON L1T0N7


 




Between:


Paul Takawira


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Dainoin Webb


 
Tenant



 
 
Paul Takawira (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dainoin Webb (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 15, 2021 to February 14, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,300.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $6,900.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
The amount outstanding to February 14, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($2,300.00) and costs
($186.00) is $2,486.00.
 
7.     The Tenant testified
that they fell behind in rent because
they were in the hospital
and unable to communicate with the Landlord.
 
8.     The Landlord was opposed to a payment
plan, but did not provide
evidence concerning the
prejudice they would suffer if I granted the Tenants request.
 
9.     Based on the substantial payments made by the Tenant
after the Landlord filed their application and based on the evidence of the Tenant being in the hospital
and unable to




 
communicate with the Landlord, I find it would not be unfair
to order the payment plan in
order to preserve the tenancy.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,486.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($2,300.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending February 14,
2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a) 
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of February 2022 up to and including December 2022 in full, on
or before the 15th day of each corresponding month.




 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under
paragraph 1 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order
shall become payable on the day following the date of default.

shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
