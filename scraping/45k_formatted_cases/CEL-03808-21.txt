In the matter of:      20 GLADESIDE PLACE
BRAMPTON ON L6S1X3
 




Between:                  Navdeep Sandhu Ranjeet Sandhu


Landlords




 
 
And
 
Jenna Collet                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
 
 
Navdeep Sandhu and Ranjeet Sandhu
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jenna Collet (the 'Tenant') and Aniyah Francis because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (the L1
application).
 
As well, the Landlords
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (the
L2 application).
 
These applications were heard by
video conference on January 6,
2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, Muhammad Naqvi, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
It is undisputed that the notice
of termination for each application names the Tenant’s four year old daughter,
Aniyah Francis, as a tenant; and that Aniyah Francis, is not, in fact, a
tenant. As such, I determined the notices are fatally defective. I orally ruled
to dismiss the L2 application, at which time Mr. Naqvi requested that the L1 application be
withdrawn, I granted this request.




File Number: CEL-03808-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
The Landlord’s applications are dismissed without
consideration of their merits.
