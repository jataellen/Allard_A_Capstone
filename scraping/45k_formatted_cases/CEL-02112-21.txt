Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02112-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      451 AUGUSTA STREET
SOUTHAMPTON ON N0H2L0
 




Between:                  Jason Bates
Diane Bates


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Cara Crandon
Jamie Crandon


Tenants




 
 
 
Jason Bates and
Diane Bates (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Cara Crandon and Jamie Crandon (the 'Tenants')
because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of
the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord, Diane Bates (‘DB’),
the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Miranda
Medve, and the Tenants attended the hearing. The
Tenants spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary matters:
 
1.    
On consent,
the application is amended to reflect the current monthly
rent is $1,209.25.
 
2.    
The Tenants
adjournment request to summons the purchaser as a witness
is denied. The Tenants had ample notice of the
hearing and could have summonsed the purchaser but failed to do so. Adjourning
the hearing would result in further delay and undue prejudice to the Landlords.
 
L2 application:
 
3.    
David Ramage (the ‘Purchaser’) has an Agreement
of Purchase and Sale (‘APS’)
with the Landlords for the
purchase of the residential complex.
A copy of the APS, dated June 23, 2021, was tendered as evidence (Tab 2,
Landlords’ Evidence Brief).




File Number: CEL-02112-21
 
4.    
The Landlords paid the
Tenants one month’s rent compensation in accordance with subsection 49.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) by waiving rent for the month of July 2021.
 
5.    
The Landlords filed a copy of the Purchaser’s declaration (Tab 4, Landlords’ Evidence Brief).
 
6.    
The remaining issue to determine is whether the Purchaser
in good faith requires
possession of the residential complex for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
7.    
For the following
reasons, the Landlords led insufficient evidence to establish that the
Purchaser in good faith requires
possession of the residential complex
for the purpose
of residential occupation.
 
8.    
The Tenants contest the
Purchaser’s good faith intentions. The Purchaser was not present at the hearing
to give evidence about their intention. I give little weight to the Purchaser’s declaration and to DB’s testimony about the Purchaser’s intentions because
this evidence is hearsay.
 
9.    
On the basis of the
evidence presented at the hearing, I am not satisfied that the Purchaser in good faith requires possession of the residential complex for purpose
of residential occupation.
 
10.  Therefore,
the Landlords’ application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords' application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay back $1,209.25 to the Landlords, representing the one month’s
rent compensation given to the Tenants.
