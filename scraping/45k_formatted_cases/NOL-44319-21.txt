Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44319-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


B,
5620 DESCHENES ROAD HAMMER ON P3P1R3


 




Between:


Richard Despatie


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joseph R Hembruff Minday Desareais


Tenants



 
 
 
Richard Despatie
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Joseph R
Hembruff and Minday
Desareais (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Monique Laderoute, attended the hearing. As of 2:25 p.m.,
the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $900.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $8,900.00 after
the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,841.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $2,651.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of
the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
February 8, 2022
