Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19384-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


8 HOLLOWAY STREET BELLEVILLE ON K8P1N6


 




Between:


Hasan Berber


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Katherina Twitty


Tenant



 
 
 
Hasan Berber (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Katherina Twitty (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice of
Eviction served to the Tenant September 10, 2021, I find that from January 2021 to September 10, 2021, the Tenant
was late paying the rent 9 months out of the 9-month period.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,500.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 31, 2017 to November 30, 2021
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,555.00.
 
5.     The Landlord testified that he is seeking termination
of the tenancy based on the persistently late payments,
plus the Tenant has not paid any rent since September 2021. Further he is self-employed, has two children
in school, and is having
financial difficulties
himself. The Landlord also testified that he held off on giving
the Tenant the N8 notice of
termination to give her a chance, but nothing has changed; he cannot afford for
this to




 
continue. He does not believe the
tenancy can be saved; he just received order TEL- 19616-21 dated January 5, 2022, that gives the Tenant until January 28, 2022 to pay the arrears of $6,591.50. He is
emotionally tired and stressed with the lack of payment and does not believe
the Tenant can clear the arrears and pay on time.
 
6.     The Tenant testified that she understands she is in
arrears but had a family emergency that needed attended to. She has a family
member moving in and can start paying the rent
on time; with respect to the arrears,
she can pay $50.00 per month to get caught
up. She is a long-term Tenant, 4 to 5 years, and wants to stay. If she
is evicted, she needs time to move as she has no where to go.
 
7.    
Later in her testimony the Tenant advised
that her mother
would pay the arrears if the
tenancy is not terminated.
 
8.     The Landlord responded that he has not seen any effort
by the Tenant and does not trust that things will improve, there are
also issues such as garbage that the Tenant is not addressing.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
There is no prejudice to the Landlord if the arrears are cleared and the Tenant
pays on time.
 
10.  It should be noted that on the application the Landlord indicated
$2,100.00 based on willful damage by the Tenant. As damage
was not pursued at the hearing, it is not included in this order.
 
11.  This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision within it. No
further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application for
eviction of the Tenant is denied on the condition that the Tenant pay to the Landlord the arrears owing pursuant to order TEL-19616-21 on or before January 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the Tenant pays the full amount from paragraph 1 by
the required date, then the tenancy is preserved
on the condition that the Tenant pay the lawful rent to the Landlord
in full and on time for the period February 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023.
 
3.     If the Tenant fails to make any payments in accordance
with paragraph 2, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant,
The Landlord must make the application
within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1 of this order.




 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the amount
from paragraph 1 by the required
date, then the tenancy is
terminated February 28, 2022 and the last month rent deposit would be applied
to rent for the month of February.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the Tenant
does not pay the amount
from paragraph 1 and the unit is not vacated on or
before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
