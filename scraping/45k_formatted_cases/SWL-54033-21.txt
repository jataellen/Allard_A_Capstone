Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54033-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


555
  LAFONTAINE STREET WALLACEBURG ON N8A4J5


 




Between:


Philip Lumley


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kayrue Snektzer


Tenant



 
 
 
Philip Lumley
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kayrue
Snektzer (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 6, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord
served the Tenant with a Form
N12 notice of termination seeking
termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by
the Landlord.
 
2.   
The termination date set out in
the Form N12 was October 31, 2021. As
a preliminary matter, the issue of non-payment by the Landlord to the Tenant of
one month’s compensation was raised.
 
3.    Section 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) states that,
“a landlord shall compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s rent or offer the tenant another rental unit acceptable to the tenant if the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy under section 48”. Section 55.1 of the Act
further requires that compensation under section 48.1 be paid to the Tenant no
later than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination.
 
4.    The termination date set out in the Form N12 is
October 31, 2021. I find the Landlord
did not provide the Tenant with one month’s compensation on or before
termination date. The Landlord’s
application thus fails for lack of required compensation.
