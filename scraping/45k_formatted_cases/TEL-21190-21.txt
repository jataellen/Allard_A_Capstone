Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TEL-21190-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
2ND AND 3RD
FLOOR, 240 RITSON
ROAD SOUTH
OSHAWA ON L1H5H7


 




Between:


Hang Fan Kuan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dana Treacher


Tenant



 
 
 
Hang Fan Kuan (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Dana Treacher (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 19,
2020 with respect to application TEL-05425-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the
lawful monthly rent in full on or before November
1, 2021, which was a breach of the previous order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$10,863.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-05425-19. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $8,263.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-05425-19 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from September 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order TEL-05425-19 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $15,959.08*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 17, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$50.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
