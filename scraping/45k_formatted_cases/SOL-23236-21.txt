and


 




 


Christine Jackson


Tenant



 
 
 
Arkledun Apartments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christine Jackson and Russell Hiebert (the ‘Tenants’) because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have:
•        
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant;
•        
committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal
trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex,
and
•       
seriously impaired the safety
of any person.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on September 29, 2021.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative David Rubin and the Tenant
Christine Jackson attended
the hearing. The Landlord presented Kim Herrop and Lucas Taylor as
witnesses.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order
terminating the tenancy because the Tenants have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege
or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claims that the Tenants, an occupant or their guests
have committed an illegal act in the rental
unit or the residential
complex. The Landlord did not pursue the claim that there was an act which
seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
2.       
As a preliminary issue, the
Landlord's Legal Representative submits that R.H. is not a tenant but is merely
an authorized occupant
of the unit. This was confirmed by the
Tenant C.J.. The Landlord’s agent seemingly erred in naming
R.H. as a Tenant in the application.




 
I am satisfied that R.H. is not a tenant and, as a result, his name shall
be removed from the application.
 
3.       
The following facts are not in dispute:
 
(1)  
Between June 8, 2021 and June 24, 2021, the Landlord
received a number of reports from other tenants and a report
from a staff person about thefts from their personal lockers within the
residential complex.
 
(2)   On June 25, 2021 the Landlord’s agents
contacted the police
to report the incidents.
 
(3)   Upon investigation, the Landlord and police reviewed
video surveillance tapes. The
security cameras operated
by the Landlord within the residential complex
captured the occupant R.H. in
the garage area loading items from a shopping cart into a vehicle, which he
then drove out of the complex. It was determined by police that the vehicle was
stolen.
 
(4)   R.H. was subsequently arrested and charged
with theft. At the time of the hearing,
R.H. was incarcerated.
 
(5)  
The Landlord investigated further
and discovered that the locking
mechanisms to certain storage
units had been broken and that the netting in some units was damaged.
 
(6)   The stolen items
have not been located or recovered.
 
(7)   The total cost to the Landlord for repairs to the damaged
storage units is $946.94.
 
4.       
I am not satisfied that the Tenant
had knowledge of the incidents or was involved in the commission of the offences. She wishes to maintain the tenancy and seeks a conditional
order. C.J. has offered to pay for the damage caused by her occupant.
 
5.       
The Landlord was not opposed to
such an order, and is willing to preserve the tenancy of C.J., if certain
conditions are met. I was satisfied that the parties understood the
consequences of the conditions to be imposed, and a conditional order will
issue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s application to evict the Tenant is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
For a period of 12 months
from the date of this order, the Tenant, any other occupant of the rental unit or their
guests, shall not permit R.H. to enter the rental unit or the residential
complex in which the rental unit is located at any time.
 
(b)  
Should R.H. attempt to enter the to enter the
rental unit or the residential complex, the Tenant
shall immediately contact the Landlord’s agent or property manager by telephone
to advise the Landlord of the occurrence and of her efforts, or the efforts of
other occupants or guests, to prevent R.H. from entering and/or, as the case
may be,




 
to advise the Landlord
of the steps taken to contact the authorities to have R.H. forthwith removed from the rental
unit or residential complex.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $946.94,
which represents compensation for the damages to
the unit and/or to the residential complex.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 2 of this
order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




February 15, 2022


$157.82




March 15, 2022

April 15,
  2022

May 15, 2022


$157.82




June 15, 2022


$157.82




July 15, 2022


$157.82



 
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before July 15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated July 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     
If the Tenant fails to comply
with any of the conditions set out above in paragraph 1 of this order, then within 30 days of the
breach the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
