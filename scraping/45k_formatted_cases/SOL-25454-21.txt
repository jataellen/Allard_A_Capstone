Tenant



 
 
 
Joe Abbruscato (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steven Barcham (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the
premises and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, Shikha
Kasal and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
Section 43(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act states:
 
Where this Act permits
a landlord or tenant to give a notice of termination,
the notice shall be in a form approved by the Board and shall,
 
(a)    
identify the rental unit for which the notice is given;
 
2.     
The Landlord’s N7 Notice to
Terminate did not identify unit number in the
residential complex. This omission renders the Notice void.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
