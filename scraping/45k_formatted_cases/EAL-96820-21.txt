Landlord




 


and


 




 


Brittany
  McGillvray


Tenant



 
Stuart Nesbitt (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brittany McGillvray
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on November
10, 2021.
The Landlord, the Landlord's Representative Tessa Morris,
the Tenant and the Tenant's Legal Representative Linda Tranter
attended the hearing.
The Purchase of the residential complex
Cole Gordon also attended the hearing to give
testimony.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
2.    
Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
3.     On July 27, 2021 the Landlord gave the Tenant a (N12)
form notice to end the tenancy because the Landlord entered into an
agreement of purchase and sale and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The termination date in
the (N12) notice was September 30, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant did not vacate
the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.




 
5.    
A copy of the Agreement of
Purchase and Sale was submitted confirming that the Landlord entered into an agreement of purchase and sale and the purchaser requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. An amending agreement was
attached that the closing was extended to November 20, 2021 because the Tenant
had not moved out of the rental unit and the Landlord/Seller could not give
vacant possession of the rental unit.
6.    
The Landlord has filed
a declaration from a
Cole Gordon, the named Purchaser affirming he has purchased the property and he in good faith
requires the rental unit for his own personal use.
7.    
The Landlord purports that compensation equal to one month's rent was paid by waiving rent owing for the month of
August 2021.
8.    
The Landlord is seeking a standard order for termination of the tenancy on or before November
30, 2021.
9.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under
section 49(1) of the Act are
1)    
The Notice:
 
49(3) The date for termination specified in a notice given under subsection (1) or (2) shall
be at least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of
the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the
term.
 
2)    
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1)
(b) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by the person who personally
requires the rental unit certifying that the person in good faith requires the
rental unit for his or her own personal use.
 
3)    
Compensation
 
Section 49.1 (1) states - A landlord shall compensate a tenant
in an amount equal to one
month’s rent or offer the tenant another
rental unit acceptable to the tenant if, [emphasis]
(a)  the landlord
gives the tenant
a (N12) notice of termination of the tenancy
on behalf of a purchaser under subsection 49 (1) or
(2):
 
Section 55.1
states - If the landlord is required to compensate a tenant under section 48.1,
49.1, 52, 54 or 55, the landlord
shall compensate the tenant no later than on the termination date specified in the notice of
termination of the tenancy given
by the landlord under section 48, 49 or 50. [emphasis].
 
10.  I received extensive testimony from both the Landlord
and the Tenant and their respective Representatives during the hearing and was asked to refer to documents,
emails and text messaging sent to and received by the parties. All recited
their own interpretation of the legislation and how it should be applied.




 
11.  The Tenant's Legal Representative
raised a number of section
83 submissions relating
to the Tenant’s personal family and financial circumstances that the
termination of the tenancy should be extended and postponed to give the Tenant
additional time to find alternative accommodation.
12.  One of the documents submitted was a copy of a N11
form agreement signed by the Tenant. The Form N11 provided a termination date
of October 31, 2021. It was the testimony from the Landlord that an extension
of time was already mutually
agreed upon.
13.  I am mindful that the N12 notice given is based on the
landlord having entered into an agreement of purchase and sale and that poses
added financial costs and tax implications to be considered
if the purchase of the property did not close
by year end.
14.  All in all, I am satisfied that the Landlord
has met all the technical
requirements pursuant to
section 49 of the Residential Tenancies Act.
15.  After consideration of all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the COVID pandemic
on the parties, I find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until December
31, 2021 to provide the Tenant the additional time to find alternative accommodation.
16.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from June 1, 2021.
17.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of December
31, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
December 31, 2021.
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 31, 2021, then starting January
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 1, 2022.
4.    
If the Tenant has not moved out of
the rental unit on or before December 31, 2021, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$26.51 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
