Review Order
 
1539 Barton Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brian Asselstine (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Tenant
has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date. (L2 application)
 
The L1/L2 application was resolved by order SOL-15006-20 issued on April 20, 2021.
 
On April 20, 2021, the Tenant
requested a review of the order. That request was resolved by order
SOL-15006-20-RV issued May 3, 2021. The Tenant filed an appeal of that order.
On November 10, 2021 the Divisional Court issued a decision remitting this
review request back to the Board for a decision by a different Member. The
Tenant filed an amended review
request on November 12, 2021. By interim
order SOL-15006-20-RV-IN issued
November 15, 2021 I granted the request to amend. This review
hearing was held based on the Tenant’s amended review request.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on January 28, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative J. Novis (JN), the Landlord’s legal representative J. Struthers, the Tenant, and the Tenant’s legal
representative K. Remington attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review




 
1.    
At the hearing the Landlord consented
to the Tenant’s request for a review.
The review was therefore
granted and the Landlord’s L1 and L2 applications were heard de novo.
 
L1 application
 
2.     The parties agree that the Tenant owes no arrears to
January 31, 2022, that the Tenant has also paid most of the cost of the application filing
fee, and that the only amount owed as of the hearing date is $4.97,
which is the remainder of the cost of the filing fee.
 
3.     As per subs. 207(4) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and s. 58 of the General Regulation under the Act,
the Board has no jurisdiction to make an order for an amount less than five dollars. The Landlord’s L1 application shall therefore be dismissed.
 
L2 application
 
4.     The Landlord’s L2 application is on the ground of
persistent late payment of rent. It is agreed
by the parties that the Tenant has been persistently late in payment
of the rent.
 
5.     The Tenant is 49 years old and has lived in the rental
unit for 20 years. The monthly rent is $584.75 and the Tenant’s monthly income
is $1,295.00 from a disability pension. Due to disabilities, the Tenant is
unable to work. The Tenant paid his rent late for many of the months of 2018. The Tenant paid no rent to the
Landlord for a 13 month period ending in April 2021. The Tenant testified that
he was given legal advice to withhold his rent until the April 14, 2021 hearing
date. The Tenant cleared his arrears on May 2, 2021 then did not make any rent
payments again until September 15, 2021. The Tenant did not give a very cogent
explanation as to why he did not pay rent during this period (money was stolen
from him in early 2021 and he was hit by a car on September 14, 2021). The
Tenant mostly cleared his arrears
on September 15, 2021, completely cleared his arrears on September 17, 2021, and has
made his rent payments on time and in full since then. The Tenant testified
that he can continue pay his rent on time and in the future.
 
6.     JN co-owns the residential complex.
At the hearing JN testified
that, due to the Landlord’s inability to meet its
financial obligations, the Landlord had to take out a COVID related government
loan, a portion of which is forgivable if another portion of it is paid off. JN
testified that no part of this loan was forgiven because the Landlord did not
pay the required portion off. JN testified that this happened, not because
of the Tenant’s failure to
pay rent for 13 months (because he had cleared his arrears in time for the
Landlord to pay a portion of the loan in order to get the loan forgiveness);
rather, the Landlord refrained from paying off a part of this loan because of
speculation that the Tenant would stop paying for a long period of time in the
future and because of maintenance work that needs to be done in the residential
complex. In other words, the Tenant’s failure to pay rent for 13 months was not
the main stressor on the Landlord’s finances.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. While the
Tenant has a history of late payments going back to 2018 and the Tenant’s
reasons for not paying rent for more than a year and then for another four
month period




 
after that were weak, I have also
considered that this is a 20 year tenancy, the Tenant has disabilities and a
very limited income, the Tenant is not currently in arrears, and the Tenant has
paid rent promptly since September 2021. Although the Tenant’s conduct caused the Landlord some inconvenience, it would not be unfair to grant relief in the form of a prompt payment order in these
circumstances. Because of the Tenant’s problematic payment history, it is
appropriate for the prompt payment order to be extended from the usual 12 month
period to an 18 month period.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-15006-20 issued
on April 20, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
2.     The L1 application is dismissed.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
monthly rent owing on or before the first day of each month commencing March 1, 2022 and continuing thereafter until and including
August 1, 2023.
 
4.     If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in
paragraph three above, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach and without notice to
the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
