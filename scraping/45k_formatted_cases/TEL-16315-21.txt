1205, 222 NONQUON
ROAD OSHAWA ON L1G3S6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenants




 


Colleen
Noxon Mathew Forget


 



 
 
Bedford Properties &
Estates Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colleen Noxon and Mathew Forget
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Curtis Begg, attended the hearing. As of 3:12 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective March 19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,650.00.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $7,550.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent
deposit has been paid to the Tenants for the period from September 25, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 3, 2022

pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. Additional time given to
the Tenants to pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 3, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $7,411.68*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 12, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 13, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 3, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 4, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 3, 2022, then starting February
4, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 4, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$10,146.25 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$11,796.25 if the payment
is made on or before
February 3, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 4, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
