Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-96089-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


982 TELFORD AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1K3J7


 




Between:


Clausie Louima


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nicolas
Hazel


Tenant



 
 
 
Clausie Louima (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicolas Hazel (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 9:31 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly notified of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N4 notice of termination dated May 6, 2021 on the Tenant.
The N4 did not indicate if any arrears of rent were owing.
 
2.    
Notices of termination
must comply with all requirements contained in the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (Act), otherwise they are void.
This strict approach to technical requirements is to ensure that the Tenant is aware of the conduct
or issue and the steps needed to remedy it if they are to
avoid eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
