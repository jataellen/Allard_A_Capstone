On August 30, 2021, Toronto
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yevhen
Yermolenko (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay compensation for damage the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on July 14, 2021
with respect to application TSL-15630-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord $100.00
on or before May 1, 2021, June 1,
2021, July 1, 2021 and August 1, 2021 towards arrears of rent.
 
3.       
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $7,686.00 for rent arrears and costs in Order TSL-15630-
20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $7,686.00
and that amount is included in this order.
As a result, the previous
order TSL-15630-20 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order TSL-15630-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,686.00. This amount represents the rent arrears and costs.

4.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

and the Board will schedule a hearing.
