Mark Persaud


Tenant



 
 
 
Quadreal Residential Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Mark Persaud (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on July 5, 2021 with respect to
application TNL-29521-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $2,930.09 arrears
on or before January 1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay $2,535.44 rent on or before
January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $26,510.69 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-29521-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $11,551.48 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-29521-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 01, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,535.44 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2022 to
February 14, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-29521-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$16,290.33*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 14, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $83.36 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
 
 
February 14, 2022

The tenant has until February 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 24, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
