File Number: SOT-17508-20
 
 
In the matter of:      2, 45 CONNAUGHT
AVENUE S
HAMILTON ON L8M3C4
 
Between:                  Hila Hannani                                    Tenant
 
 
and
 




Unlimited Residential Ali Zandi


Landlords




 
 
 
Hila Hannani (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Ali Zandi and Unlimited Residential (the 'Landlords') withheld
or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital services that the Landlords are
obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on October 13, 2021 at 9am.
Only the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.       
The Tenant
testified that she complained to the Landlord because
the rental unit was not
properly or sufficiently heated for numerous dates from January
2020 to November
2020.
2.       
The Landlord
responded with providing the Tenant one space heater
for the two bedroom
apartment which the Tenant found unsatisfactory.
3.       
The Tenant subsequently gave the Landlord
45 days notice
that they would be moving out on November 1, 2020.
4.       
The Tenant moved out of the unit with 45 days notice but the Landlord
refused to provide the Tenant
with their last month’s rent of $1500.00.




File Number: SOT-17508-20
 
5.       
The Tenant
was forced to rent another
rental unit for $600.00 a month more than they were paying the Landlord.
6.       
Therefore, as the Tenant’s
evidence is uncontroverted, I find that the Landlords
withheld a reasonable supply
of a vital service, that the Landlords were obligated to supply under the
tenancy agreement with the reasonable supply of vital service and that the
Tenant suffered damages as a result of the Landlords failure to provide vital
services.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy
between the Landlords
and the Tenant
was terminated as of December
1, 2020.
2.       
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant
$1500.00 within 30 days which represents the Tenant’s last months rent and reasonable damages for failing
to provide vital services,
specifically sufficient heat for the rental unit.
