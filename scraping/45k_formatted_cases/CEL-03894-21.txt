Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03894-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


5,
  2 DAVID STREET BRAMPTON ON L6X1J1


 




Between:


Angela Battiston


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dan Bedard


Tenant



 
 
 
Angela Battiston (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dan Bedard (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and the Tenant because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 7, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 24, 2021 to February 28,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $125.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenant has been sending the Landlord offensive
texts, claiming that she sexually harassed him and bribed by-law officers. The Tenant yells and creams at other tenants
and calls them names.
 
4.     This conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other
tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.




 
5.    
This conduct also substantially interferes with a lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,169.66*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$19.36 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 1, 2022, then starting March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
February 18, 2022

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order

date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
jurisdiction where the rental unit is located
