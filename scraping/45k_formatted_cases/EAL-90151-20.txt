In the matter
of:


401, 20 GLENN WOOD
PLACE BROCKVILLE ON K6V2T2


 




Between:


Siteline 5-30
Glen Wood LP


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Julie Van Der Heide


Tenant



 
 
Siteline 5-30 Glen Wood LP (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Julie Van
Der Heide (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on February 28,
2020 with respect to application EAL-84318-19.
 
This matter was Directed
to hearing due to the inadvertent passage of time from the filing of the
L4 application, thus requiring updated information.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Michaela
Bailey, attended the hearing. As of 1:43 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that at the time the Landlord
filed the L4 application, April 14, 2020, the Tenant has
not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
i)                   
Pay $436.06 by March 5, 2020 per
2(b). $0 was paid.
ii)                 
April rent, $872.03, on April 1, 2020. Only $642.03 was paid on April 3, 2020.
 
3.     The Landlord's Legal Representative testified that the
amount remaining from order EAL- 84318-19 is $687.91
plus the Tenant
now owes, to November 30, 2021, $9,844.03, which is over 3 times the amount owing at the original hearing
on February 10, 2020. A ledger outlining the Tenant’s payments was entered into
evidence.




 
4.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
5.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,696.06 for rent arrears
in Order EAL-84318-19. The amount that is still owing from that order is $687.91 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
EAL-84318-19 is cancelled.
 
6.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from March 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021.
 
7.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $859.32 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to November 30,2021.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did not abide by the
conditional order and now owes more than at the original hearing.
 
10.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-84318-19 is cancelled and replaced with this order.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,598.80*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $28.67 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
