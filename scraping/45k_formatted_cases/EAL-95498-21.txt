Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-95498-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


418, 123 AUGUSTA STREET OTTAWA ON K1N8B7


 




Between:


Ottawa Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Keith Robinson


Tenant



 
 
 
Ottawa Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Keith Robinson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on September 1, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord and their Legal
Representative, Laura Clark,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:21 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing, although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently denied
the Landlord and their staff access to the unit who
made reasonable efforts to treat the unit for pest infestation.
 
2.    
This conduct has substantially
interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of
the residential complex. The Tenant’s reluctance to grant the pest control
workers access to the unit is causing pests to remain in the unit and spread to
neighbouring units in the building. Also, the Manager of the Integrated Pest
Management Team (Andrew Fuller) testified that the Tenant was aggressive using
swearing words at the staff when they were inspecting the unit to find out if treatment
was required.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence
provided by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenant substantially




File Number: EAL-95498-21
 
interfered with the Landlord
and other tenants
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex by consistently
denying access to the unit so that it can be treated for pest infestation. I
see no reason to deny the eviction order requested by the Landlord.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 1, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 12, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,050.84, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from April 30, 2021 to
February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $3.78 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
