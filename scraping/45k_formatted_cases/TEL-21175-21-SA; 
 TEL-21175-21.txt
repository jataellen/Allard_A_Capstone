Aaron Augustt


Tenant



 
Canadian Student Living Group, LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Aaron
Augustt (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on April 30, 2021 with respect to application TEL-15956-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by ex parte order TEL-21175-21, issued on January 7, 2022. The Tenant filed a motion to set
aside order TEL-21175-21.
 
This motion was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord’s Agent,
Emily Barbati, attended
the hearing. The Tenant was able
to consult with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant did not dispute
the breaches by him
in respect of the ex parte order that issued on January 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant testified
concerning the circumstances that led to the breaches
of the order in November
2021, and his additional breaches of the order since that time to the date of
this motion hearing.
 
3.     The Tenant testified
that the job he had earlier which led him to commit to the payment
terms under the original TEL-15956-21 order was lost abruptly, and he found
himself unable to meet the terms of the payment plan in November 2021. Subsequently, the Tenant testified that he
recently started a new full-time job in December 2021 for a company that has
him working in a GM warehouse in south Oshawa.
 
4.     The Tenant stated his belief that his current arrears
amount (including the filing fee amount) was $5,496.00 to January 31, 2022. This amount agreed
with the Landlord’s own submissions (ledger filed
with the Board prior to the hearing), and the Landlord’s




 
Agent pointed out that since the November 2021 breaches, the Tenant has made no further payments for rent or arrears.
 
5.    
The Tenant was cross-examined by
the Landlord’s Agent, during which he stated his desire to maintain the tenancy
(under a new payment plan that he proposed that would see $300.00 biweekly
payments instead of the previous $150.00 biweekly payments). The Tenant affirmed he has earned
some $1,200.00 with his new employer thus far, and he would be willing to submit
evidence to show he is gainfully employed and can make the payments he
proposed.
 
6.     The Landlord’s Agent submitted that the Tenant has
continually failed to make rent payments and now arrears payments, and so the
Landlord does not believe the Tenant can comply with a new payment plan (as
proposed by the Tenant) that requires the Tenant to pay more regularly.      The Landlord
requests the motion
to set aside be denied, therefore, but indicated the lifting
of the stay could be postponed to February 28, 2022.
 
7.    
In final submissions, the Tenant
stated he does not deny he breached the underlying order due to employment
problems not of his doing, but asked that he be able to submit proof of his new employment and be given
a chance to maintain his tenancy. If the Board decides against his motion,
the Tenant stated that lifting of the stay on February 28, 2022 would be a fair
amount of time for him to find a new place to live.
 
8.    
Based on the submissions of the
parties, I found both parties provided very strong submissions. However,
I was persuaded sufficiently on a balance
of probabilities that the
circumstances surrounding the Tenant’s breaches were unforeseen, and indeed led
the Tenant to breach the payment order. The
Tenant’s submissions concerning his desire to bring his rent arrears account to
a zero balance were straightforward, earnest and rooted in the Tenant’s firm
belief that he could get back on track. As
a result, I indicated to the parties that I believe the Tenant should be given one last chance to make good on paying his arrears in full, to keep his
tenancy intact.
 
9.    
I made this latter statement on
the condition that first the Tenant submit evidence to the Landlord and Board concerning his recent full-time employment status and the income
he is now earning. I set a
deadline for a post-hearing Tenant submission of 5:00 pm, January 28, 2022 for
the Tenant to do so. I then requested
a post-hearing submission from the Landlord concerning the upcoming monthly
rent being paid on/before February 1, 2022, for February’s rent. I set a deadline for a post-hearing
Landlord submission of 5:00 pm, February 2, 2022.
 
10.  If the Tenant
complies with the evidence deadline
and pays his February 2022 rent in full
and on time (to show his
good faith), I indicated that I would
grant the Tenant’s motion to set
aside, and I would order a new payment plan that would see $600.00 being paid
for arrears on/before February
15, 2022, and then $300.00
every two weeks afterwards until the
arrears balance is brought to zero. During the arrears
payment schedule, all monthly
rents would continue to be payable in full, and on time. From the parties’ own submissions, I find the current rent
arrears, inclusive of filing fee costs, are $5,496.00 up to January 31, 2022.




 
11.  If the Tenant fails to comply with the evidence
deadline and/or the payment of February
2022 rent in full and on time, then I indicated I would deny the set aside
motion and lift the stay on order TEL-21175-21, issued on January 7, 2022, as
requested by the Landlord.
 
12.  I confirm that the Tenant emailed the Board, and the
Landlord, on January 24, 2022, providing a confirming letter of employment (by People Store Staffing Solutions, Inc.) and ‘jpg’ files
displaying pay information for December 2021 and January 2022. I note that the Tenant also goes by
another name of Aaron Brown that is interchanged with the name used under the
tenancy, i.e. Aaron Augustt.
 
13.  I also confirm that nothing was received by the Board
from the Landlord by the set deadline of February 2, 2022. In fact, as of the writing of this order,
the Board’s legal records show nothing received from the Landlord in the way of
a post-hearing submission. Consequently,
I am unable to find whether the Tenant paid his February 2022 rent in full and
on time. While I will consider the
absence of the Landlord’s post- hearing submission to simply weigh in favour of
the Tenant’s request to have his motion granted, I will nevertheless include the February
1, 2022 rent payment as an integral
part of the Tenant’s proposed repayment plan, and make it the first
payment due under that plan.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant’s motion
to set aside is granted.
 
2.     Ex parte order TEL-21175-21, issued on January
7, 2022, is therefore set aside. An order that is set aside cannot be enforced.
 
3.     Board order TEL-15956-21 issued on April 30, 2021,
is hereby cancelled and replaced with
the following order.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,496.00, which
represents the arrears
of rent and costs outstanding
to the Landlord for the period ending January 31, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 4 of this order:
