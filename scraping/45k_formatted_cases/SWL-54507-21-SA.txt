Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54507-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 2 ARTHUR
STREET SOUTH ELMIRA ON
  N3B2M5


 




Between:


Yiannis Kaskampas


Landlord




 


 
And


 




 


Cory Dewitt


Tenant



 
 
 
Yiannis
Kaskampas (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Cory Dewitt (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement
to terminate the tenancy.
 
The
application was heard by video conference on January 28, 2022. The Landlord's
Legal Representative, M. Grossman and the Tenant's Legal Representative, J.
Dean attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord filed an Application to End a Tenancy –
Tenant Gave Notice or Agreed to Terminate the Tenancy alleging that Tenant
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
2.     Apart from the fact that the notice of termination is
not in a Board approved form, the Landlord filed the application over 30 days after the purported termination date of April
30, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord argued that having served the Tenant with
a Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser, or a Family
Member Requires the Rental Unit (N12), the 30 days should not be counted from
April 30, 2021.
 
4.    
This application was received by
the Board on August 26, 2021 and filed pursuant to section 77 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) which permits
the Landlord to file to
terminate the tenancy when the parties have entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy or the Tenant has given the Landlord a notice of
termination. As a result, the N12 notice is irrelevant to my consideration in
this case.
 
5.    
Pursuant to Section 77(3) of the
Act, an application under this
section shall not be made later than 30 days after the termination date
specified in the agreement or notice. This means the Landlord’s application
is out of time and will be dismissed.

6.     The Tenant's Legal Representative
requested an order for costs of $450.00
for time spent preparing for the hearing as the
Landlord was previously informed of the errors with the application but chose
to proceed.
 
7.     The Landlord appeared to have genuinely misunderstood
the law with respect to their application and I do not find their conduct sufficiently unreasonable to warrant an order for costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
