Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24212-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


504, 85 THORNCLIFFE PARK DRIVE TORONTO
  ON M4H1L6


 




Between:


Morguard Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kiera A.S. Sangster


Tenant



 
 
 
Morguard
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kiera A.S. Sangster (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 18, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Faith McGregor, attended the hearing. As of 10:51 a.m., the Tenant was not present nor represented although served properly with a Notice of
Hearing by the Board,
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, this is a
month-to-month tenancy in which rent is due on the first of every month.
 
2.     The Landlord alleges the Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due for the period between September
2020 to October 2021. This resulted
in the Landlord serving the Tenant an N8 notice of termination on September 2,
2021.
 
3.     Since serving the N8 notice of termination, the Tenant
has paid the rent on time for the months of November
and December but was late for the month of January. The Landlord
is seeking to terminate the tenancy.
 
4.     Based on the uncontested evidence
before the Board, I am satisfied
that the Tenant
has persistently paid her rent late from September 2020 to October 2021;
however, I find that the monthly rent was paid, for the majority of time,
within the rental month.




File Number: TSL-24212-21
 
 
5.    
This is a long term tenancy; the
Tenant has lived in the rental unit since February 2014 and since the N8 notice
of termination was served, the Tenant has attempted to rectify her behaviour by
paying the rent on time for the months of November and December 2021.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. Given the fact that the this is a
long-term tenancy and the Tenant has consistently paid the rent within the
rental month, I find it appropriate
to exercise relief.
 
7.    
A
conditional order shall issue permitting the tenancy to continue so long as the
Tenant continues to pay the rent on time for the next 12 months.
 
8.    
This order contains all of the
reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
new rent on time and in full for the period commencing March 2022 through to February
2023.
 
2.   
If the Tenant fails to make any
one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 1 of this order the Landlord
may, without notice to the Tenant and within 30 days of the breach, apply to
the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application on or before February
27, 2022.
 
4.   
If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 3 of this order, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually onthe balance
outstanding.
