Review Order
 
 
Khurram Khan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joan Green
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-94917-20 issued on July 5, 2021.
 
On July 27, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order because she believes there’s
an error in finding about the last month rent deposit.
On July 30, 2021, interim order CEL-94917-20-RV-IN was issued staying
the order dated
July 5, 2021.
 
The request
was heard by videoconference on November 3, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, Charlene Lewin and the Tenant, Joan Green attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
There’s no dispute that
at the original hearing there was no discussion about per diem compensation
owing after the termination date on the N12 Notice of Termination. The Landlord does not dispute
the Tenant has paid all the rent owing to April 24, 2021 which is the date the Tenant vacated the
rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant states there’s
an error in the order as she was ordered
to pay the Landlord’s cost
for filing the application. The Landlord argues
that he’s entitled to the cost because the Tenant didn’t vacate in accordance with that N12 Notice. Although, the Landlord had

a reasonable cause to file the application for eviction, the application is based on no-fault
notice of termination. The Landlord had the onus of requesting costs at the
first hearing and he did not, therefore he’s not entitled to the application
fee.
 
3.    
Given my findings based on the submissions made, I find the order contains serious errors.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-94917-20 issued on June 25, 2021 is varied
in the following manner:
 
2.    
Paragraph numbers
2, 3, 4 and 5 of the order CEL-94917-20 issued on July 5, 2021 is cancelled.
