In the matter
of:


92, 835 DEVINE
STREET SARNIA ON N7T7P6


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Duane
Goodall


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Duane
Goodall (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 4, 2020 with respect to application SWL-39671-19.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s agent, M. Beaton, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
2.    
The Landlord
alleges that the Tenant harassed
the Landlord’s employee, and therefore breached
paragraph 1a of the order SWl-39671-19.
 
3.    
The matter
was sent to a hearing
to provide more clarity about the alleged
breach.
 
4.    
The Tenant did not attend the hearing scheduled
for 1 p.m. I waited an hour, and then I
proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s
allegation was that the Tenant caused a continual disturbance to its employee,
M. Kameka (MK), who was acting as assistant resident manager of the residential complex,
thereby breaching paragraph
1a of the order SWL-55838-21, issued on August 4, 2020, that forbade the Tenant from “yelling, threatening or causing any kind
of disturbance to other residents or staff”.




 
 
6.    
The Landlord’s original
N5 notices of termination alleged various disturbances in the residential complex,
including threats to smash an employee’s head with a hammer, and threats to burn down the residential
complex.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s witness, MK, began working for the Landlord
in March 2020. She lives in
the residential complex. She said
that the Tenant constantly followed her around the residential complex. She said that he attempted to bring her a wedding dress and rings, and he tried
repeatedly to have her accept them, despite multiple notices from the staff not to go near her. She said that he added
cash and gifts to these piles of objects he left
at her own unit door. In the
Landlord’s L4 application, it alleged an incident like this had occurred on May
28, 2021.
 
8.    
MK said that the
Landlord served the Tenant with N5 notices of termination that specifically
listed this nuisance behaviour. She
said that the police have spoken to the Tenant
about this behaviour, and that she pressed harassment charges against him. She
said that the first incident of the Tenant leaving a wedding dress and gifts at her door was on June 27,
2020. MK said that the Tenant has
left things at her door at least 10 times since March 2020, when she began
working for the Landlord.
 
9.    
MK said that his stalking caused
her to lose sleep and caused her stress-induced vertigo. She said that she has seen the
Tenant watch her from her peephole or from his balcony. MK said that she was in
such fear from the Tenant that she moved from the residential complex in
September 2021. She said that she is
completely “off balance” because of this behaviour. She also said that whenever she passed the Tenant in the
hallway, he would get aggressive if she did not speak to him.
 
10.  The Landlord submits
that the Tenant
has breached the conditional order of August
4, 2020, and it is now seeking eviction.
 
11.  I find that the Tenant has not met the
following conditions specified in the order:
The Tenant has not refrained from yelling, threatening or causing any kind of disturbance to residents and staff for a one-year
period starting August 9, 2020. Despite
several warnings, and notices of termination about interfering, harassing and
stalking MK, the assistant resident manager of the residential complex, the
Tenant continued this behaviour, specifically on May 28, 2021.
 
12.  The hearing Member already considered the
Tenant’s mental disability in the original hearing order SWL-55838-21. The order issued in August,
2020, provided a remedy that took into account the duty to accommodate to the point of
undue hardship as required
by the Ontario Human Rights Code. The
Tenant has now breached that order. Consequently, I find that the tenancy is no
longer viable.
 
13.  MK gave testimony about living in fear, and
she also now suffers from a mental health condition triggered by the Tenant’s
behaviour. Specifically, the Tenant
presents a substantial interference to the enjoyment
of the residents of the residential complex,
and he is a threat to the physical and mental well being of the
residents and staff of the residential complex. The Landlord has the obligation to ensure the safety of all the
residents and employees of the complex, and the Tenant’s behaviour interferes
with the




 
 
Landlord’s right
and obligation to provide a safe environment for its employees and other tenants.
 
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances above in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-39671-19, issued on August 4, 2020, is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
