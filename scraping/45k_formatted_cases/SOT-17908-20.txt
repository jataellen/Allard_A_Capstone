In the matter
of:


205 GILMORE ROAD FORT ERIE
ON L2A2M2


 




Between:


Nicole George


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Julia Fleming


Landlord



 
Nicole George (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Julia Fleming
(the 'Landlord') has
collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 6, 2021.
 
Only the Tenant attended
the hearing when the matter was called at 9:52am. The Tenant was represented by Jennifer Priestly.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Based on the Tenant’s
uncontested evidence, we are satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Landlord failed to provide the Tenant with compensation pursuant to subsection
48.1 of the Act. The Landlord is ordered to pay the Tenants $950.00 by January
17, 2022.
 
T1 Application
 
Compensation for the N12 Notice
 
2.    
The Tenant’s
uncontested evidence was on April 26, 2020, she received a N12 Notice
of Termination from the Landlord stating
that the Landlord
was ending the tenancy because her child intends to move into the
rental unit. The termination date on the N12 was June 29, 2020.
 
3.    
The Tenant testified
that she moved out of the rental unit pursuant to the N12 Notice by June 29,
2020. On that date, the Tenant testified that she did not receive the required
one-month compensation nor was she in arrears of rent prior to moving out of
the rental unit. When she discussed the issue of compensation with the Landlord, the Landlord told her in an email dated May 28, 2020
that this would be provided to her on the date of termination – however, this
did not occur. As such, the Tenant proceeded to file her T1 application with
the Board on November 9, 2020.

4.    
Based on the evidence
before the Board, we are satisfied that the Landlord failed to provide the
Tenant with compensation pursuant to subsection 48.1 of the Act and in doing so, the Landlord
is deemed to have retained
money in contravention of section
135(1.1) of the Act.
 
5.     As a result,
the Landlord is ordered to pay the Tenants compensation in the amount of
$950.00 which is equal to one month’s rent.
 
6.    
This order
contains all of the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The
Landlord shall pay to the Tenant the
sum of $950.00 on or before January 17, 2022. This amount represents $950.00 in compensation required under section 48.1 of the Act.
 
2.    
If the Landlord fails to pay the Tenant the full amount of $950.00 on order before January 17, 2022, then the
Landlord will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
3.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
