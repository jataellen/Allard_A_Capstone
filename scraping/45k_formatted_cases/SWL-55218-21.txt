Rob Ghione Holdings
Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Charisse Holland (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Tim Currie, attended the hearing. As of 1:44 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was $995.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
30, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$4,947.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 30, 2021.




File Number: SWL-55218-21
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
