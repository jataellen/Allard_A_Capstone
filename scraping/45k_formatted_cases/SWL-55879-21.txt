101, 294 CHANDLER DRIVE KITCHENER ON N2E2K1


 




Between:


Galaxy Real

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Abdul Basir Hussini


Tenant



 
 
Galaxy Real
Estate Core Ontario Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Abdul Basir Hussini (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes. The Landlord
also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. As of 1:52 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Gail
Kukor-Lang attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
As of January 1, 2022, the lawful monthly rent for the unit is $1,105.50.
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $20.00
for administration charges
related to a cheque
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,092.40 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
September 29, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenant paid $3,290.30 after the application was filed.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement

Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 2, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 2, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $397.54*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
10, 2022 and the total charges related
to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$35.91 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 2, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 3, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 2, 2022, then starting
March 3, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 3, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust:
i)         
$2,403.90 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)        
$3,509.40 if the payment
is made on or before
March 2, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
March 3, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
