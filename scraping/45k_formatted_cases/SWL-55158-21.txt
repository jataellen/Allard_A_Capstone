In the
  matter of:


42 LEWIS CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2A2T6


 




Between:


2773378 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andrew Falles Christina Martinak


Tenants



 
 
 
2773378 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christina Martinak and Andrew Falles
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Lisa Nadon, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$2,700.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 15, 2020 to September 18, 2021.
 
8.    
The Tenants
paid $1,900.00 after the application was filed.
 
9.    
The amount
outstanding to November
30, 2021, inclusive of rent arrears,
and costs, is
$6,486.00.
 
10.  At the hearing, the Tenants submitted a
series of texts between themselves and the Landlord which indicated that if the Tenants left by the end of November that the Landlord would forgive the arrears owing
as long as the Landlord received a written guarantee that the Tenants would
leave on or before December 1, 2021. The Tenants stated that since they did in
fact leave before December 1, 2021 that their arrears should be forgiven.
 
11.  However,
the Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that the Tenants
did not provide the written guarantee that the
Landlord requested. The Landlord’s Legal Representative explained that written
guarantee was required by the Landlord due to a potential sale of the rental
property.
 
12.  The Tenants admitted
that no written
guarantee was given to the Landlord. However,
the Tenants did leave as requested by the Landlord and the reason that
they left was under the condition of promised rent forgiveness.
 
13.  However,
given the circumstances of this matter
and the information presented, I find that it would not be unreasonable to split
the arrears owing between the Landlord and the Tenants since both parties share
responsibility for the events that occurred. In this way, the Tenants receive
some benefit for leaving as promised but not the entire amount due to the fact
they did not submit the written guarantee the Landlord had asked for.
 
14. 
This order
contains all of the reasons
in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November 30, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $1,787.31, which represents half of the current amount
$3,574.61* owing. This $3,574.61 represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
(Please refer to the attached
Summary of Calculations for the breakdown of
these arrears.)
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $93.00
which is half of the $186.00 for the
cost of filing the application.




 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
27, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
