A.P.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 application’) and has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
November 13, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by B.R.
 
This amended order
is issued to correct clerical errors in the original order issued on November
15, 2018.
 
Determinations:
THE APPLICATION FOR
NON-PAYMENT OF RENT (THE L1 APPLICATION)
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to
November 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 26, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant paid $2,921.00
after the application was filed.
3.     
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending November 30, 2018 total $1,201.92.
4.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 10, 2015 to August 26, 2018
totalling $68.30.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT (THE L2 APPLICATION)
7.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Since October, 2017 the Tenant
has never paid rent on time. 
RELIEF FROM EVICTION
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered the
Landlord’s request that the tenancy continue provided the Tenant clears the
rent arrears and pays rent on time into the future, and find that it would not
be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in
this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
THE APPLICATION FOR
NON-PAYMENT OF RENT (THE L1 APPLICATION)
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids this
part order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated for non-payment of rent. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit
on or before November 26, 2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $134.88*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant:
$41.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 16,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 26, 2018, then starting November 27, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 27, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before November
26, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,391.92** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this part of the order for eviction will be void.  This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated for non-payment of rent and the Tenant
could remain in the unit subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 9 of
this order.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this part of the
order if he pays the amount required under that subsection on or after November
27, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE APPLICATION FOR
PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT (THE L2 APPLICATION)
9.     
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order above pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 then:
(1)  The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on
time and in full for the period December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019.
(2)  If the Tenant fails to make any one of the
payments in accordance with subparagraph 9(1) this order, the Landlord may,
within 30 days of the Tenant's breach and without notice to the Tenant, apply
to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after November 30, 2018.
10.   Due to a potential Canada Post strike, the
Landlord must immediately give a copy of this Order to the Tenant by:
 
•       
handing it to the Tenant;
•       
handing it to an apparently
adult person in the rental unit;
•       
leaving it in the Tenant’s
mailbox; or, 
•       
if there is no mailbox,
leaving it at the place where mail is ordinarily delivered to the Tenant; or
•       
placing a copy of the order
under the door of the rental unit or through a mail slot in the door.
 
The Landlord
shall not use regular mail, registered mail, Xpresspost or any courier service
that is used by Canada Post to deliver the Order.
