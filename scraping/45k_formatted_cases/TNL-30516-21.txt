Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-30516-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 85 OXFORD
STREET RICHMOND HILL ON L4C4L6


 




Between:


Hongquan Hu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Panagiotis Skrekis


Tenant



 
 
 
Hongquan Hu (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Panagiotis Skrekis (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on July 5, 2021. The Landlord was represented
by Rong Wei Yu. As of 10:29 a.m. the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice
of this hearing
as it appears from the Certificate of Service.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 15, 2019 to July 14, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,750.00.
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing
for the period
ending July 31, 2021 as of the date of hearing
were $26,250.00
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 10, 2019 to January 27, 2021.




File Number: TNL-30516-21
 
 
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including whether the Landlord had attempted to negotiate
a repayment plan with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $31,299.40 (less any payments made to the Landlord after July 5,
2021)*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $50.34
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)               
$34,529.75 if the
payment is made on or before January
14, 2022(less any payments made to the Landlord after
July 5, 2021), or
ii)             
$36,061.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 16, 2022(less any payments made to the Landlord after
July 5, 2021)**.
 
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-30516-21
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
