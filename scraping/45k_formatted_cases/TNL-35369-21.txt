Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35369-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


202, 2757 KIPLING AVENUE TORONTO ON M9V4C4


 




Between:


Amstar Pool I
  LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ruth Pierre


Tenant



 
 
Amstar Pool I LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ruth Pierre (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 10, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sara Mathew, attended the hearing. As of
10:18 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,468.66.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,447.77 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 29, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $5,502.70 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $981.07*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$48.28 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit, and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       
$1,225.62 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)       $2,694.28 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the
amount required under that
subsection on or after April 1, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
