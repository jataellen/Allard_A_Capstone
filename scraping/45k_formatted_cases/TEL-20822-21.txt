Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20822-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


563 SETTLERS ROAD WEST
  OAKVILLE ON L6M1N7


 




Between:


Jin Long Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donna
Rumble Jeffrey Rumble


Tenants



 
 
 
Jin Long Zhang
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jeffrey Rumble and Donna Rumble (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 7, 2022 at 9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord, Jin Long Zhang, represented by Steven Jackson,
a licensed Paralegal, and the Tenants,
Donna Rumble and Jeffrey Runble, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is dismissed because
the Landlord did not
meet the requirements for this application under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
2.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act because the purchaser wants to
move into the rental unit.
 
3.    
Section 72 (1) of the Act states
 
“The Board shall not make an order terminating a tenancy and evicting
the tenant in an application under section
69 based on, (a)
a notice of termination given
under section 48 on or after the day section 13 of the Rental Fairness Act, 2017 comes into
force, unless the landlord has filed with the Board an affidavit sworn by the
person who personally requires the rental unit certifying that the person in
good faith requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for a
period of at least one year.”

4.    
The Declaration filed with the Board does not certify
that the purchaser
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal
use “for at least one year”.
 
5.    
Therefore, I find that the Landlord
has not satisfied a
statutory requirement for this
application and the application must therefore be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
