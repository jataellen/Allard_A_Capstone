This
application was heard by video conference on January 13, 2022. Only the

attended the hearing.
The Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental
unit on September 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $920.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,840.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
