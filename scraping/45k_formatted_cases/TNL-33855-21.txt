Meiju Wang


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Sui Hung-Joey Mo


Tenant



 
Meiju Wang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sui Hung-
Joey Mo (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative Virginia
Guo, the Tenant
and the Tenant's Legal Representative Qiu Ling (aka Lisa) Yang attended
the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s daughter Jiao Jian Shen was also in attendance to give testimony.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant commenced November
1, 2018 for a
12-month fixed term. The lawful rent at that time was $2,330.00
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,330.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from November 1, 2018.
 
3.    
This is an application under section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
4.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a) 
the landlord,
(b) 
the landlord’s spouse,
or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.




 
5.    
On August 3, 2021 the Landlord
sent to the Tenant via mail to the address of the rental unit a (N12) Notice
to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by the Landlord
and a child of the Landlord.
 
6.     The termination date in the (N12) notice was October
31, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit in accordance with the termination date set
out in the notice given.
8.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
9.     The Landlord's Legal
Representative asserted that the compensation in an amount equal to one
month’s rent was provided to the Tenant by personal cheque payable to the
Tenant dated August 15, 2021 that was mailed to the Tenant
where mail is normally sent.
 
10.  To-date the Tenant's
Legal Representative purports
that the compensation cheque was not
received by the Tenant.
 
11.  At issue is a determination whether compensation has been provided
to satisfy Section
55.1 of the Act and or Section 83(4)
of the Act.
 
12.  When a landlord
serves a document
to a tenant in accordance with one of the permitted methods set out in subsection
191(1) of the Act or Rule 3 of the Board’s Rules, there is no concomitant
obligation on the Landlord to prove the tenant actually received the document.
Rule 3.1 5). lists one of the permissible methods of service to be




 
13.  Board’s Rules permits
a document to be served
by sending it by mail to the address where the tenant or former tenant
resides;
 
14.  Section 191(1) of the Act states - A notice or document
is sufficiently given to a person
other than the Board,
(f) by sending it by mail to the last known address where the person resides or carries on business
 
15.  Section 83(4) of the Act states:
The Board shall not issue an eviction order in a proceeding regarding
termination of a tenancy
for the purposes of residential occupation, …until the landlord has
complied with section 48.1, 49.1, 52, 54 or 55, as the case may be.
 
16.  The Tenant's Legal Representative agreed to accept
payment of the required
compensation as of the day of the hearing.
 
17.  The Landlord filed two Declarations, one sworn by the
Landlord and a second by Jiao Jian Shen a child of the Landlord
affirming that they in good faith personally require the rental
unit for their own personal use for at least one-year period.
 
18.  Therefore, I was satisfied the technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act were met.
 
19.  The Tenant disputed
the good faith intentions of the Landlord.
 
20.  The Landlord's Legal Representative testified that the Landlord
is currently residing
in China and waiting for possession of the rental unit to relocate. The
Landlord's Legal Representative stated the Landlord is deemed a permanent
resident of Canada but requires a place of residency before being permitted to
move to Canada. During the interim, the daughter of the Landlord and her son
(the Landlord’s grandson) will take immediate possession of the unit with the
unit.
 
21.  All in all, based on the totality of the testimonies
given by both parties, and all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. I was satisfied that the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for personal use by her and her daughter.
 
22.  The Tenant sought an extension of time to vacate the rental unit. The parties subsequently agreed to an extended
termination date of March 31, 2022.
 
23.  Based on the Parties agreement, I find that it would not
be unfair to postpone the eviction
until March 31, 2022.




 
 
24.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,520.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020.
 
25.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31, 2022.
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $49.97
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
