Tenants




 
 
Paramount Property Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Abdishakur Sildan
and Abdirahman Suldan (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Allan
Kouri, attended the hearing. As of 2:20 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on December
1, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,199.00
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,199.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2021 to September 23, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: EAL-97958-21
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of December
1, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,426.84*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
1, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
