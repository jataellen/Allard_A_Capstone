Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04513-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 51 JUNIPER CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L6S1J9


 




Between:


Jazz Virk Parjeet
Virk


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Debbie Hashey


Tenant



 
 
 
Jazz Virk and Parjeet
Virk (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Debbie Hashey (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on January 4, 2022 with respect to application
CEL-02441-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $2200.00 rent on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenant did not
pay $1,000.00 arrears on or before January 1, 2022
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order
for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $19,129.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-02441-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $19,129.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-02441-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,200.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from September 20, 2020 to February 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-02441-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 15, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$19,416.13*.(Less any amount paid since the application was filed on January
21, 2022.) This amount represents the rent owing up to February 4, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $72.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 5, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 16, 2022.
 
 
February 4, 2022

The tenant has until February 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
