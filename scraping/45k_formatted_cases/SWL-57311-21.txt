File Number: SWL-57311-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
503, 325 GILES
BOULEVARD W WINDSOR ON
  N9A6H7


 




Between:


Meddco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bernard Knoll


Tenant



 
 
 
On November 18, 2021, Meddco
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Bernard Knoll (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition
specified in the consent order issued by the Board on October 28, 2021 with
respect to L1 application SWL-53228-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed
to pay $1,500.00 (arrears) on or before October 22, 2021. The Tenant
also failed to pay $937.37 (rent) on or before November 1, 2021. These were breaches of paragraphs 2(a) and
3 of the consent order respectively. This L4 application was filed within 30
days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting consent order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent.
Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant agreed in paragraph 1
of the consent order to pay $3,919.44 for rent arrears and the costs related to
the Landlord's L1 application fee. The amount that is still owing from the consent
order is $2,719.44 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous consent order SWL-53228-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from November
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
On October 12, 2017 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenant for the period from the date of collection, October
12, 2017 to December 30, 2020. There was no guideline rent increase
(and consequently no interest on deposit) allowed in 2021 due to COVID19.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SWL-53228-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,656.81*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $30.82 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant actually
moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 77(6) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
