This order
was originally issued on Feb 10, 2022. It
subsequently came to the attention of the Landlord
and Tenant Board
(the ‘Board’) that paragraph 5 under determinations contains a
typographical error. The error is that the word “landlord” was used instead of
“tenant”. The order is amended to
correct this clerical error to provide greater clarity to the parties. The amended portions are bolded and
underlined for ease of reference.
 
 
Huron Green
Inc. C/o Linwood Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jeff Hurst and Tammy Hurst (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenants permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s
legal representative, C. Dawdy,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:46 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by
the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord served
the Tenants with an N5 Notice of Termination on May 7, 2021.
 
2.     The N5 Notice
alleged that on May 6, 2021, the Tenants were in arrears
of $619.84 in water
charges.
 
3.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:




 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially
interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
4.     Subsection 64(3) states that the notice of termination
under subsection (1) is void if the tenant,
within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct
or activity or corrects
the omission.
 
5.     I am satisfied that the Tenant not paying the
utilities in full and on time substantially interferes with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment. The Landlord submitted
that it has the financial
burden of paying the water bill to ensure that the unit continues to have
water. I am also satisfied that the Landlord Tenant did
not void the Notice pursuant to subsection 64(3) as the Landlord’s evidence was that the Tenant did not pay the water bill by May 14,
2021.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord disclosed
that this is not the first application that the Landlord
had brought against
the Tenants. The Landlord
had previously filed an application for nonpayment of rent, for the Tenants’
debris and for the Tenants’ water bill. To date, the water bill balance
outstanding is $483.59.
 
7.     In consideration of the foregoing, and the fact that
the Tenants did not attend the hearing to disclose their circumstances for me
to consider delaying or denying eviction, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
21, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 22, 2022.
