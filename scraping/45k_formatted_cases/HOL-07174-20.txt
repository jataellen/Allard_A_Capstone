In the matter
of:


207, 2396
MAJOR MACKENZIE DRIVE
W MAPLE ON L6A4Y1


 




Between:


Vivienne Grahahm
  Pauline Levy


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Cherylanne Higgins


Tenant



 
 
 
Vivienne Grahahm and Pauline Levy
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cherylanne Higgins (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in
by videoconference on July 2, 2021. The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary matter:
 
1.    
The Landlords served the Tenant
with an N8 Notice of Termination (the ‘N8 Notice’) on March 20, 2020. The N8 notice
alleges that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     This is a month
to month tenancy and the rent is due on the 4th of the month.
 
3.     The N8 Notice identifies one late rent payment in
March, 2020. Section 58(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act (2006) permits
a landlord to give a Tenant a notice of termination on the grounds
that “The tenant
has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and payable.”
 
4.    
The N8 Notice was served pursuant
to a single late payment of rent. As the word “persistent” suggests
repeated, although not necessarily sequential, late payments over a
period of time, I requested submissions from the parties with respect to the
validity of the N8 notice.




File Number: HOL-07174-20
 
 
 
 
5.    
One of the Landlords, Pauline Levy
(PL) stated that the Tenant had paid the rent on time for the
12 months between February, 2019 and January 2020 in compliance with a previous Board order (HOT-03553-18/TNL-09529-18). The Landlords had served the N8
Notice and filed the application because once the Tenant had satisfied the
previous Board order, she had begun to pay her rent late.
 
6.     I explained to the parties that I could not consider
the Tenant’s late payments prior to 2019, as they had already
been adjudicated, and the doctrine
of res judicata
would apply.
 
7.     Res judicata is the principle that a party may not litigate the same issue twice. If a court
or tribunal of competent jurisdiction has already decided an issue
between the parties, then the parties are bound by that determination. They may
not bring new proceedings seeking a
different outcome.
 
8.     PL also testified that the Tenant had
paid the rent late in February, 2020, as she had paid the rent after 8:00 pm on February 4,
the date that it was due, but after the bank had closed. She stated that the member who heard the previous L2 application
in 2018, had told the Tenant that she must pay the rent before 4:00 p.m. on the
date that it was due. The previous order was silent on the time of day the rent
was due.
 
9.     As noted above,
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 refers to “the date the rent is due and payable.” As PL acknowledged that the Tenant had paid the rent on February
4, 2020, I find that the Tenant paid the rent for February 2020, on time and in
full.
 
10.  As the N8 Notice identifies only one late payment, and therefore does not set out a
pattern of persistent late payments, the Notice is defective and the Landlords’ application must be dismissed.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
February 25, 2022
