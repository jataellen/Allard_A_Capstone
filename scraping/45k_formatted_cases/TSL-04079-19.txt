AA
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AT
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 21, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised the following issues pursuant to
section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'): the
Tenant claimed compensation for damage to her mattress, bedding, and clothes,
alleged that the Landlord failed to maintain the rental unit or comply with
housing standards, and further alleged that the Landlord failed to provide her
with the prescribed standard lease.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 20, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant paid $2,800.00 after the application was filed. 
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 6, 2018
to February 20, 2019.
 
5.      The
Tenant claimed over $2,000.00 in compensation for damage to her mattress,
bedding, clothes and jacket because workmen sent to the unit by the Landlord on
January 23, 2019, closed her bedroom door, causing her cat, who is incontinent,
to defecate and urinate on her bed. The Tenant is responsible for her cat.
Knowing the medical problems of her cat, she could have made arrangements for
the care of the cat. The usual practice where a pet-owing tenant requests
maintenance is to make arrangements to keep the pet away from maintenance
workers and arrange any care required. The Tenant did not make any arrangements
for the care of her cat and did not inform that Landlord of her cat’s special
circumstances.  In any event, the damage was not reasonably foreseeable. The
Landlord did not contemplate that there was an incontinent cat in the rental
unit.  Under the circumstances, the Tenant is not entitled to compensation.
 
6.      The
Tenant further alleged that the Landlord failed to maintain the rental unit and
did not comply with housing standards.  The tenancy commenced on January 1,
2019.  Soon after the Tenant moved in, she complained that the microwave was
slow, the oven was dirty and the cooktop was damaged.  The Landlord bought a
new microwave and a new stove. The stove was delivered on January 23, 2019, the
day the Tenant’s cat soiled her bedding and clothes. The Landlord acknowledged
that the toilet handle and toilet seat were loose and added the toilet to the
list of things for his plumber to fix.
 
7.      The
Tenant requested a screen door for the balcony, but the Landlord declined on
the ground that the condo did not come with a screen door.  The Landlord gave
the Tenant permission to install a screen door at her own expense. The Tenant
characterized the balcony door as a window submitted that it does not comply
with housing standards. The balcony door is not a window. As the Landlord noted,
the condo units in the complex were not built with screens for balcony doors. 
Some owners or residents installed screen doors after they took position of
their units. The condo building would not have passed inspection if it did not
comply with housing standards.
 
8.      We
find that the Landlord responded adequately to the Tenant’s maintenance
requests therefore the Tenant is not entitled to an abatement of rent.

 
9.      The
Tenant withheld one month’s rent because the Landlord failed to provide her
with a standard lease pursuant to section 12.1 of the Act. The Tenant submitted
that she is entitled to retain the rent withheld.
 
10.   Pursuant
to section 12.1 of the Act, effective April 30, 2018, Landlords, except those
exempt under Ontario Regulation 9/18, must use the prescribed standard
lease for tenancy agreements. The tenancy commenced in January 2019 and the
Landlord is not exempt. On March 2, 2019, the Tenant requested in writing that
the Landlord provide a proposed tenancy agreement based on the standard lease
form.  The Landlord did not respond within 21 days, therefore the Tenant was
entitled to withhold one month’s rent and did withhold the rent for April 2019
in the amount of $2,000.00 (section 12.1(6) of the Act).  At the time of the
hearing, more than 30 days after the first rent payment was withheld, the
Landlord had not provided the Tenant with a proposed standard lease.   Thus,
the Landlord may not require the Tenant to pay the withheld rent (section
12.1(9) of the Act).  The withheld rent has been deducted from the amount of
rent owing.
 
11.   We
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant requested a delay of the eviction until
July 31, 2019, to enable her to find new accommodation.  The Landlord was
agreeable to the delay, provided the Tenant paid the rent for June 2019.  The
Landlord has advised the Board that the Tenant has not paid the rent for June
2019.  It would be unfair to delay the eviction and permit the Tenant to live
rent-free for the month of June 2019.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 21, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,739.98*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 10, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the
withheld rent.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 11, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
21, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 22, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 21, 2019, then starting June 22,
2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 22, 2019.
 
8.      If,
on or before June 21, 2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,390.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 22, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
