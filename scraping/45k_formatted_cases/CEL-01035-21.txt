Tenants



 
 
 
Jaspreet Gill and Sukhvir Gill
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Justin Domingo and Diana Trejo (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 952 5218 8731#
on October 1, 2021. Only the
Landlord’s representative Sushma Bhakal attended the hearing.
 
The parties have minutes
of settlement. This order reflects
the terms as presented at the
hearing. The Tenants have signed an
N11 agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenants
vacate the rental
unit and provide
vacant possession to the Landlord
on or before April 30, 2022,
the Landlord shall pay to the Tenants $8,000.00 on receipt of vacant possession
of the rental unit.

5.    
The Tenants have the right to collect the full amount any time after April 30, 2022.
 
6.     If the Landlord
does not pay the full amount owing by May 1, 2022, the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated at
2% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
7.     Should the Tenants
fail to vacate the rental
unit on or before April 30, 2022, the Tenants forfeit their right to the
compensation of $8,000.00.
