Montgomery Square Inc. c/o Rhapsody Property
Management Services (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jeremy Hubbs, Jessika Welch and Adam Anderson (the 'Tenants')

This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, Amy Aikin,
and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sam Ursino, attended the hearing.
As of 1:20 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2020 to
September 30, 2020. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 27,
2020.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on December
9, 2020. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $3,145.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,895.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 20, 2020 to

vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
