Between:


Hastings Local Housing

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert
Davidson


Tenant



 
 
 
Hastings Local
Housing Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Davidson (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant;
and because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex
involving the production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the
possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Property
Manager, Carrie Lough,
on behalf of the Landlord
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. Duty Counsel assisted
at hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    For the reasons
that follow the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.   
On August 21, 2021 the Landlord
served the Tenant a
N5 and N6 Notice of Eviction. The notices were dated August 21, 2021
and had a termination date of September 21, 2021. The notices seek to terminate
the tenancy because the Landlord alleges the Tenant, or someone living in the unit:
substantially interfered with another tenant’s
or the Landlord’s reasonable
enjoyment of the residential (N5) and is carrying on an illegal act or illegal
business in the residential complex (N6).
 
N6 notice of termination




File Number: TEL-19551-21
 
3.   
The particulars section
in the N6 notice indicated “see Schedule A” as the reason(s) for eviction, however
the details in Schedule A were only with respect
to the N5 notice. In Ball
v. Metro
Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931, the court
held that notices of termination must contain specific details as to the
behaviour complained of for the
Tenant to know the case to meet. Here, the Tenant was not given any details as
to what the allegations were, therefore, I find that she did not know the case to meet.
Accordingly, he N6 notice is fatally
flawed and this part of the application is dismissed.
 
N5 notice of termination
 
4.   
The Landlord testified
that on August 10, 2021, he was contacted by another tenant, Richard Davidson,
that that a package that had been delivered for him was missing from the mail
area. The Landlord checked the video and saw
that the Tenant had gone into the mailroom and taken the package. The next incident
testified to occurred
on September 10, 2021.
 
5.   
On
cross examination, the Landlord agreed that the N5 notice was served on August
21, 2021, and between the voiding
period of August
22nd and August 29th, no further incidents occurred.
 
6.   
Duty Counsel
submitted that based on the Landlord’s testimony, the N5 was voided,
therefore any subsequent behaviour should have been on a 2nd N5 notice. As the application is based on a 1st N5 notice, it must be dismissed.
 
7.   
The Landlord's Legal Representative did not dispute
the Tenant's Legal Representative’s
submissions.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed
without prejudice.
