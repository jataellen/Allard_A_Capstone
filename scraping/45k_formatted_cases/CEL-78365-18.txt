Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006










 
 

KJ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict AA (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (L1).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2).
 
This L1/L2 application was heard in Mississauga on
October 2, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, SS, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant disputed the rent
arrears of $6,764.00 owing to October 31, 2018 as claimed by the Landlord in
this application.  The Tenant further submitted that the Landlord is holding a
last month’s rent deposit of $2,000.00 which was paid when he first moved into
the unit in April 2014.  
2.     
The Tenant stated that he
made cash payments to the Landlord for which the Landlord has not provided any
receipts.  He further stated that the previous application brought by the
Landlord was withdrawn.  In that application, the Landlord claimed December
2017 rent as outstanding and in this application the Landlord claimed January
2018 rent as outstanding.  The Tenant believes that this misinformation
demonstrates the Landlord’s fraudulent character.  
3.     
There was no dispute that
the previous application brought by the Landlord was withdrawn due to an error
in the N4 notice of termination.   There was also no dispute that the Tenant
made a payment to the Landlord on December 31, 2017.  This payment was applied
to January 2018 in the first application and December 2017 in this application. 
At this hearing, the Tenant argued that the December payment was for January. 
In any event, I am not satisfied that this discredits the Landlord’s position
that rent is owing for one of those months. 
4.     
The evidence before me was
insufficient to find that the Tenant paid the rent arrears claimed in this
application by way of cash payments to the Landlord.  The Tenant’s evidence
regarding these cash payments was inconsistent.  Initially, the Tenant stated
that he paid the rent at the end of each month for the following month.  The
Landlord’s ledger showed a number of payments made at the end of the month. 
However, then the Tenant stated for those months outstanding that he paid the
Landlord in cash on the 2nd or 3rd of the month. 
5.     
As well, the Tenant stated
that he paid the owner of the property directly for the month of March 2018 and
submitted copies of his text messages to the owner in support of his assertion.
The Tenant was responsible to pay rent to the Landlord, who has sub-let the
rental unit to the Tenant as per their sub-let agreement.  Therefore, I am
satisfied that the March 2018 payment was not paid to the Landlord, whether or
not the Tenant paid an amount to the owner.  
6.     
Cash payments are very
difficult to establish without any receipts.  The Tenant submitted that the
Landlord does not provide receipts.  The Landlord submitted a copy of an email
exchange between the parties wherein the Tenant requested receipts and the
Landlord responded that receipts cannot be provided for payments not received. 
The Tenant regularly paid his rent via e-transfer to the Landlord except for
the months that remain outstanding.  Therefore, I find it unlikely given that
this method of payment was the usual practice for the Tenant that he would
intermittently pay the Landlord in cash which incidentally amount to the months
where rent is owed.
7.     
Consequently, I am satisfied
that the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for
the period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 10, 2018.  As
well, given the history of the Tenant’s payments and non-payment of rent, I am
satisfied that the Tenant has persistently paid the rent late. 
8.     
The Tenant stated that at the
commencement of this tenancy on April 1, 2014 he paid $4,000.00 to the Landlord
representing first and last month’s rent.  A copy of the parties’ original
agreement was submitted into evidence.  The agreement confirmed the Tenant’s
assertion.  The Landlord argued that the deposit was only $1,500.00 because the
rent was reduced and that on agreement it was used towards outstanding utility
bills in December 2014.
9.     
Subsection 106(10) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states that a last month’s rent deposit
shall only be applied to the last rental period of the tenancy.  Section 3 of
the Act does not allow parties to agree or waive rights and obligations under
the Act.  
10.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied that the Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from
the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.  The written
agreement dated April 1, 2014 confirmed a first and last month’s deposit of
$4,000.00 paid to the Landlord.  There was no evidence before me as to how this
was reduced to $1,500.00.  Also, in accordance with subsection 106(10) of the
Act, the Landlord is only entitled to apply the deposit to the last month of
the tenancy, not outstanding utilities, even if agreed by the Tenant.
11.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2014 to August 10, 2018.
12.  
The Tenant paid $3,250.00
after the application was filed.
13.  
The Tenant maintained his
dispute against the rent arrears and provided no information regarding payment any
arrears found to be owing.  However, he stated that an eviction would be
extremely stressful on his family.
14.  
The Landlord requested final
termination of this tenancy because of the rent arrears and persistent late
payment of the rent. 
15.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction related to non-payment of
rent (L1 application) until October 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. As well, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction related to persistent late payment of rent (L2 application) subject to
the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
16.  
This is a long term tenancy
of approximately four years. The Act is predicated on a remedial nature, an
extension to the end of the month to allow the Tenant an opportunity to void
the eviction by payment of the rent arrears is not an unreasonable delay.  If
the rent arrears are paid in full, the tenancy shall continue provided that the
Tenant pays the rent on time going forward.   The Tenant has demonstrated that
this is possible as the rent was paid on time since the service of the N8
notice.
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before October
31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,263.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $53.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 6, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 31, 2018, then starting November 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before October 31,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,954.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order related
to the L1 application only, if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after November 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding the L2 application
10.  
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord the lawful rent for the period of November 1, 2018 to October 31,
2019 on or before the 1st day of each month.
11.   If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in
paragraph 10 of this order, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
