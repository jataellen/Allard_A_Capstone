In the
  matter of:


203, 627 THE WEST MALL
  ETOBICOKE ON M9C4X5


 




Between:


Ashley Faulk
York Condominium Corporation No. 281


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Vince Edward


Tenant



 
 
Ashley Faulk and York Condominium Corporation No. 281 (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy of Vince Edward (the 'Tenant') and evict an unauthorized occupant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Tony Bui, and the Tenant’s wife Ashley Faulk, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Ashely Faulk testified
her husband has been moved
into a long-term care facility
and she continues to reside
in the rental unit. The testimony
shows that Ms. Faulk continues to pay the rent.
 
2.     The Landlord’s Property
Manager Nicole Hanec testified that she has not been the Ms. Faulk and that Justin Aishhurilall
will drop off the rent cheques.
 
3.     Ashely Faulk testified that she was in Calgary
when these cheques
were dropped off for
her.
 
4.     Section 3 of O. Reg. 516/06 of the Residential
Tenancies Act provides that if a tenant vacates a rental unit without
giving a notice of termination under the Act and without entering into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy, and the rental unit is the principle
residence of the spouse, the spouse is included in the definition of “tenant” in subsection
2(1) of the Act.
 
5.     Ms. Faulk is the spouse of the Tenant. As such, Ashley Faulk has become the
Tenant under this section
of the Act. The definition of a tenant
includes a person
who pays rent for the right to occupy a rental unit. In this case, the rent is being paid by Ashely Faulk.




File Number: TSL-21696-21
 
6.    
There is no evidence the Tenant’s
spouse did not reside in the rental unit when the Tenant was transferred to a long-term
care facility. I find there is insufficient evidence to conclude
that the tenancy was transferred without the Landlord’s consent.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
