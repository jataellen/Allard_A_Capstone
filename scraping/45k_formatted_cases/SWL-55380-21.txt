Tenants



 
 
 
Park Property
Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Duncan Stevens and Jordan
Leblanc (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Anita Sada, attended the hearing. As of
2:43 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 26, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,510.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
 The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,510.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 15, 2020 to August 30, 2021.
