File Number: SOL-26915-22

of:


06, 820
LIMERIDGE ROAD EAST HAMILTON ON L8W 2H3


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Albert Metcalf Tammy Metcalf


Tenants



 
 
 
On January 28, 2022, DMS Property
Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Albert Metcalf and Tammy Metcalf (the 'Tenants') and for an order to
have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 2, 2021 with respect to application SOL- 21670-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenants failed to pay the monthly
rent on or before January
1, 2022, instead,
it was paid on January 7,
2022.
 
3.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $186.00 for the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-21670-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$10.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order SOL-
21670-21 is cancelled.
 
4.     Since the date of the order, the Landlord incurred
charges of $10.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenants which were returned NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-21670-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$60.00*. This amount represents
$10.00 left owing from the previous application filing fee and $50.00 the
total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenants.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $36.62
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 1, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.

The tenants have until
February 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the
tenants file the motion by February 28, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on September 2, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this
date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
