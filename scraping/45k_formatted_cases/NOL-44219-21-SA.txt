Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44219-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


225A SIXTH AVENUE TIMMINS ON P4N5M7


 




Between:


Larry Levesque


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eric Racicot


Tenant



 
 
 
Larry Levesque (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eric Racicot (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
That application was resolved
by order NOL-44219-21 issued on November
10, 2021. The Tenant
filed a motion to set aside order NOL-44219-21.
 
This motion was heard by video
conference on January 12, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On September 24, 2021, the Landlord and the Tenant
signed an Agreement to End the Tenancy (N11)
with a termination date of November 1, 2021. The Tenant remained in the unit
past the date of termination causing the Landlord to file to evict the Tenant.
That application was resolved by order NOL-44219-21 which terminated the tenancy.
 
2.     In support of the motion to set aside the order, the
Tenant claimed that the N11 filed with the Board by the Landlord was different
from the copy he signed on September 24, 2021 with the same termination date.
 
3.     Having served the Board with numerous documents he intended to rely on at
the hearing, I find it peculiar that
the Tenant did not also send the purported original N11 to the Board as well.
In addition, the Tenant appears to have modified his claim from the motion
filed where he simply stated that the Landlord forged his signature. I do not
find the evidence of the Tenant credible.
 
4.     The Tenant testified that he intends to vacate the
rental unit on January 31, 2022 as he has found alternative accommodation. As a
result, the stay of order NOL-44219-21 is lifted on January 31, 2022.
