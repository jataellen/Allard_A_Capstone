Fred Victor
Centre (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Michelle Plourd (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on November 3, 2021 with respect to application TSL- 21922-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The mediated settlement
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the settlement:
The Tenant failed to pay $149.00 towards the arrears on or before November 1,
2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
