On January 17, 2022, R.D. Van
Rooyen Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Guy (tony) Harris (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 9, 2021 with respect to application SWL- 52488-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
As soon as possible, and no later than December
31, 2021, the Tenant was to
remove all e-bikes and his unlicensed vehicle from the residential complex
property (this included the driveway, the front yard and the back yard).
 
As of January 12, 2022, there are two e-bikes parked
in the driveway of the residential complex.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-52488-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.
