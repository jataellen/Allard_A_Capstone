Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21135-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


62 KITCHENER ROAD TORONTO ON M1E2X5


 




Between:


Asfaw Yabibal


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jamie Ledoux Nancy Jill Ledoux


Tenants



 
 
 
On November 118,
2021, Asfaw Yabibal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Nancy Jill Ledoux and Jamie Ledoux (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay compensation for damage they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 14,
2021 with respect to application TEL-09745-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$396.40 on or before November
15, 2021 towards utility
arrears.
 
3.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $4,756.82 for utility bills
in Order TEL-09745-20. The amount that is
still owing from that order is $4,360.42
and that amount is included in order TEL-09745-20.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.




File Number: TEL-21135-21
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under

the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
