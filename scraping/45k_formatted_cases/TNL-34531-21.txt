File Number: TNL-34531-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


403, 186 KINGSVIEW BOULEVARD ETOBICOKE ON M9R1V6


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nimo Gureye


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Nimo Gureye (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
13, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jason
Paine, attended the hearing. As of 10:19 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from June 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $15.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF and
$60.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,960.00.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from May 5, 2021 to
August 27, 2021.

8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $11,658.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $64.44
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $15,374.10** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-34531-21
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 17, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
