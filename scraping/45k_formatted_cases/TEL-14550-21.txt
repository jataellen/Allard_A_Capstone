Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-14550-21
 
 
In the matter of:      128 VICTORIA AVENUE
BELLEVILLE ON K8N2A9
 
Between:                  Shobha Khan                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Brandon Johnson Mackenzie Lake


Tenants




 
 
 
Shobha Khan (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brandon Johnson and Mackenzie Lake (the 'Tenants') because they have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on October 8, 2021, 9am. Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenants have
violated their lease terms by regularly smoking in their unit and have
consistently and persistently subjected and terrified neighbouring tenants
including two young children to loud noises,
swearing, domestic disturbances including death threats
at all hours.
2.       
 This conduct
has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants'
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
3.       
The Tenants
testified that work has been lost due to
lack of sleep and health issues
have been exacerbated with respect to allergies and asthma which are
triggered by second




 
hand smoke. In addition, the 2 children
of a nearby tenant are terrified and fearful for their
safety.
4.       
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of January
19, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 20, 2022.
2.       
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2598.50 which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 10,
2020 to October 1, 2021.
3.       
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $45.86
per day for compensation
for the use of the unit from January 19, 2022 to the date they move out
of the unit.
4.       
If the Tenants do
not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 19, 2022, they will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January
19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 19, 2022, then starting January
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.       
Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 20, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
