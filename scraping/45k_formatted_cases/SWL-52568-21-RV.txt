Review Order
 
Adam Maxwell (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andrea Eddleston (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SWL-52568-21 issued on October
21, 2021.
 
On October 28, 2021, the Tenant
requested a review
of the order alleging she was not reasonably able to participate in the
hearing due to technical difficulties.
 
On November 2, 2021, the Board issued interim
order SWL-52568-21-RV-IN staying
the order issued on October
21, 2021.
 
The request was heard by way of
video conference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Ted Smith,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant
spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s Request for Review
 
1.       
The Tenant testified that on the
day of the hearing, she was present but due to technical issues, no one could hear her speak. The matter proceeded
without hearing the evidence
of the Tenant.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted
that the Tenant’s
account of events
on the day of the hearing was accurate.
 
3.       
Given the Tenant intended
to participate but technical issues
prevented her from doing
so, I find it reasonable to grant the Tenant’s request to review.




 
4.       
The Tenant’s request to review the order on the grounds
she was not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing held on September 2, 2021 is granted.
 
New Hearing of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
Preliminary Issues
 
5.       
The Tenant filed with the Board
section 82 issues she wanted to raise at the hearing. The Tenant filed her section
82 issues only 4 days before
the hearing and did not serve a copy to the Landlord. Pursuant to the Board’s rule 19.4, a
tenant who would like to raise section 82 issues at a hearing, must provide a
copy to the Landlord and the Board at least 7 days before the scheduled
hearing. As the Tenant did not provide a copy of her section 82 issues to the
Landlord and did not file them with the Board at least 7 days before the
hearing, I find the Tenant is not able to raise her section 82 issues at the
hearing. This does not preclude the
Tenant from having her issues heard by the Board as the Tenant can file her own
application should she so chose.
 
L1 Application
 
6.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 29,
2021.
 
7.       
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
8.       
The monthly rent is $1,700.00.
 
9.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $300.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
10.    Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from April 15, 2020 to
June 29, 2021.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
11.   
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Tenant has not made any payments since the application was
filed. The amount the Tenant owes to
the Landlord for the rental period ending
January 31, 2022 is $29,786.00. This amount is inclusive of arrears
of rent ($29,600.00) and the cost ($186.00) of filing the application.
 
12.    The Landlord’s Representative submitted that he and the Landlord have reached out to
the Tenant multiple time prior to the hearing in attempts to discuss repayment
of the arrears of rent. The last time the Landlord’s Representative reached out was by way of
letter 2 weeks before the hearing of September 2, 2021. To date, the Tenant has not communicated a plan to repay the
arrears of rent.
 
Tenant’s Evidence




 
13.   
The Tenant testified that she does
not agree with the amount of the arrears of rent as calculated by the Landlord. The Tenant testified that she has paid the
rent almost every month by way of cash, except for the months of September,
October, November, and December 2020 which she paid by e-transfer. The Tenant claimed to have bank statements
to verify she withdrew the monthly rent from an ATM, and she had copies of the e-transfer payments. The matter
was stood down for approximately 1.5 hours for the
Tenant to provide the Board and the Landlord’s Representative with this
evidence. The Tenant sent the
Landlord’s Representative and the Board a disclosure package. The disclosure package did not contain
bank statements or copies of e-transfer payments. Rather the disclosure package
contained a Schedule A that appears to have been attached to an N5 Notice of
Termination served by the Landlord, a two second pages of N4 Notices of
Termination served by the Landlord.
 
14.    When I questioned the Tenant about the disclosure package
and that she did not provide
proof of the rent she paid, the Tenant said she did not have
the proof. When questioned by the
Landlord’s Representative as to why she did not provide a copy of the bank
statements and e-transfers payments, the Tenant said she was confused and did
not know that she needed to provide them.
 
15.    The Tenant then testified that she submitted the evidence package
with the N4 Notices of Termination and the Schedule A because
the rent amounts indicated by the Landlord were incorrect which caused her to
be confused about the amount she owed. The
Landlord’s Representative submitted that the Tenant was not confused
because when he served the N4 Notice of Termination
for which this application is based, he attached a letter explaining to the
Tenant that the previous N4 Notices of
Termination were incorrect and to disregard.
The Tenant did not challenge the Landlord’s Representative’s submissions
on this issue.
 
Findings
 
16.   
On a balance of probabilities, I
find that the arrears of rent as calculated by the Landlord are correct. In
making this finding, I considered the fact the Tenant was given ample
opportunity during the hearing to provide supporting evidence with respect to
payments she alleges to have made to the Landlord. Despite having been given nearly 1.5 hours, the Tenant never
provided evidence supporting her position that she paid almost all her rent by cash and at
least 4 payments by way of e-transfer. On the contrary,
the Landlord provided a clear
rent leger attached to the L1/L9 update sheet demonstrating the rent charged
each month and no payments made by the Tenant.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
17.   
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Landlord is a small landlord and the arrears of rent are
substantial. As the Tenant has not
made any arrangement to repay the arrears of rent owed,
the Landlord would like the tenancy terminated within 7 days of
the order being issued.




 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
18.   
The Tenant testified that she lives alone. Her 16-year-old daughter
visits her as she has shared custody.
 
19.    The Tenant has lived in the rental unit for 2 years and does not want to move out.
 
20.   
The Tenant testified that if she had to move out of the rental unit, she would need at least
6 months to find a new place as she would need time to save for the first and
last month rent deposit.
 
21.    The Tenant’s monthly
income is approximately $2,600.00/month (Ontario Works, support,
and employment income).
 
Findings
 
22.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. In making this finding, I considered the
significant amount of arrears of rent owed to the Landlord and that any delay
in eviction would further prejudice
the Landlord as arrears of rent would
most likely continue to accumulate. I
also considered the fact the Tenant has made no attempt at salvaging the
tenancy. She has not made any good faith payments and she has not communicated
to the Landlord a plan
for repayment of the arrears of rent. It is clear from the evidence presented at the
hearing that this tenancy is not viable and that there has been a breakdown in
the Landlord and Tenant relationship.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenant’s request for review is granted.
 
2.       
Order SWL-52568-21 issued on October 21, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $29,169.15*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
27, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$55.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 7, 2022, then starting February
8, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.
 
9.       
If the Tenant wishes
to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)              
$29,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$31,486.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate
deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.    The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 8, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
