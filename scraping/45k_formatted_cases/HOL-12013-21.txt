Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12013-21
 



In the
  matter of:


25
  AGAVA STREET BRAMPTON ON L7A4S5


 




Between:


Vikram Karwal Inder Kumar
Karwal


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Benjamin Santha
  Gyorgy Santha


Tenants



 
Vikram Karwal
and Inder Kumar Karwal (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Benjamin Santha and Gyorgy
Santha (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlords also claimed
NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. As
of 11:19 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord, Vikram Karwal attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective August 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $2,800.00.
 
4.     The Landlords incurred
charges of $14.00 for four cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF
and $40.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 23, 2020 to August 17, 2021.
 
7.    
The Tenants made no payments after the application was filed.
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $17,725.15*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022 and the total charges related to
four NSF cheques tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenants, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $92.05 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $22,640.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
