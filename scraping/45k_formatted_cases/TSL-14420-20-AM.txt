Determinations:

Landlord’s claim for compensation relating to damage. That claim is made
pursuant to section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act)
which states:

to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the
landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is
not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant
permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
