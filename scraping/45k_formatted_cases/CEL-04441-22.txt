In the matter
of:


204, 10 HILLTOP DRIVE HUNTSVILLE ON P1H1C5


 




Between:


G & T Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kyle Managhan
  Melanie Lavoie


Tenants



 
 
 
G & T Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Melanie Lavoie and Kyle Managhan
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to
have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January 5, 2022
with respect to application CEL-02732-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1337.50 rent on
or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $8,436.00 for rent arrears
in Order CEL-02732-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,512.50 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
CEL-02732-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $700.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2021 to
January 25, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Order CEL-02732-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$7,515.66*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 25, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 5, 2022, then starting
February 6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.

The tenant has until February 4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 4, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
 
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 6, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
