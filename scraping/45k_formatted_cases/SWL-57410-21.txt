Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57410-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


617, 308 LESTER
STREET WATERLOO ON N2L3W6


 




Between:


Xue Feng Sheng
Lihua Gong C/o
Sage Living Management Inc.


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kayla Mckenzie


Tenant



 
 
 
Xue Feng Sheng
and Lihua Gong C/o Sage Living Management Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kayla Mckenzie (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 1, 2021 with respect to application SWL- 51373-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did
not pay $2000.00 arrears on or before November 15, 2021. The Tenant did not pay
$1550.00 rent on or before September 1, 2021 or pay $1550.00 rent on or before October 1, 2021 or pay $ 1550.00 rent on or before November
1, 2021. The Tenant also did not pay $1550.00 rent
on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the
arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant
was ordered to pay $10,636.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-51373-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $10,636.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SWL-51373-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 26, 2020 to January 14, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-51373-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlords $16,047.92*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
14, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $50.96
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 26, 2022.
 
 
January 14, 2022                                                                               Date Issued                                                                       Jim McMaster

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
