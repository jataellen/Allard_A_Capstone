Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-90695-17
 










 
 
 

H.CI.I
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.G
and A.D (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 15, 2018.  The Landlord’s
representative C.K and Tenant A.G (referred to as the ‘Tenant’ singular)
attended the hearing.
 
This
was a bilingual hearing in which the Landlord’s representative participated in
English, the Tenant participated in French and S.B interpreted between the two
languages.  This order is issued in English and in French.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant initially indicated that he wanted to bring up issues that could have
been raised in applications pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  The hearing was then held down so that
the Tenant could disclose the issues he intended to raise to the Landlord’s
representative outside the hearing room.
2.      The
parties then returned and the Landlord’s representative requested an
adjournment because the Tenants’ issues had not been on notice and she needed
time to prepare her case.  The Tenant did not want the hearing to be adjourned
because he said he would be unable to take more time off work.
3.      Ultimately,
the Tenant did not raise his issues pursuant to section 82 of the Act, and he
can file his own application(s) to address those issues.  In any event, the
only real issue in dispute before me was whether the Tenants should be liable
to the Landlord for the filing fee.
4.      The
crux of the Tenant’s case was simply this: that he left the money the Landlord
claimed in the application in the superintendent’s box before the application
was filed and considered it paid.  The Landlord denied having received the
funds.
5.      There
was no allegation that the Landlord had cashed the cheque the Tenant said he
left, and the Landlord’s representative had no means of proving at the hearing
that the she received something she said she did not receive.  In fact, it was
the Tenant’s burden to prove that the amount was paid and received prior to the
filing of the application.  This could have been done, for example, by inquiring
of the Landlord’s employees after leaving the cheque and ensuring payment was
actually made. This might have been especially advisable when the Tenant should
have known the Landlord might file the application after having served the N4
notice of termination.
6.      I
therefore find that the Tenant should be liable for the filing fee.
7.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 18, 2017.
8.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $995.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2017 to
November 18, 2017.
10.   The
Tenants paid $1,990.00 after the application was filed.
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant indicated
the full amount would be paid if standard order was issued.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 4, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $210.38*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants:
$32.71 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25,
2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 4, 2018, then starting February
5, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5,
2018.
7.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,185.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,180.00 if the payment is made on or before February 4, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 5, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
