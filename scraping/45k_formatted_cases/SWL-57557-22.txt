Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


1,
  99 HEIMAN STREET KITCHENER ON N2M3L8


 




Between:


Dubrick Property Managment Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shannon Rhindress


Tenant



 
 
 
Dubrick Property Managment Ltd.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shannon Rhindress
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-49565-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $186.00 filing
fee on or before December
31, 2021. The Tenant
did not pay $1024.42 rent on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $186.00 for and the
costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-49565-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is
$45.18 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous
order SWL- 49565-21 is
cancelled.
 
4.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,024.42 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from December 1, 2021 to January 26, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57557-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-49565-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenant owes no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$103.57.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following
amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$33.68 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay any amounts that become owing
as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
