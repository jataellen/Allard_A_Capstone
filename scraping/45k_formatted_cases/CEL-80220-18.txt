Order under Section 69
and 31
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 
 
 

SH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because:
a) the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and 
b) the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant (L2 Application). 
 
The Tenants applied for an order determining that the
Landlord harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or
interfered with them and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of
their household (T2 Application).
 
This L1/L2/T2 application was heard in Mississauga on
December 17, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):  
a) Insects
b) Broken washroom tiles
c) Stove burner does not work
d) Patio door does no lock
e) Missing fire alarms
f) Bedroom window screens
g) Grass cutting
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The application was amended to add
the other Tenant to the application.
 
Determinations:
 
Regarding L1 rent owing
application 
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September
1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent is
$1,600.00.  The tenancy commenced as of February 11, 2018.
3.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to September 22,
2018.
5.     
The Tenants paid $4,800.00
after the application was filed.
6.     
The Tenants do not dispute
the amount owing to December 31, 2018.
Section 82 issues
7.     
Section 20(1) of the Act
obligates a Landlord to maintain a unit in a good state of repair.
8.     
In Onyskiw v. CJM
Property Management, 2016 ONCA 477, the Court of Appeal determined that a
contextual approach should be adopted when considering a landlord’s potential
breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will not be found if the
landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was reasonable in the circumstances.
9.     
I must also apply subsection
30(2) of the Act, and consider whether the tenant advised the landlord of the
alleged breaches before applying to the Board, and the parties’ duty to
mitigate found in section 16 of the Act.
Pests
10.  
The Tenants said they found
pests in the unit and submitted photos of several insects and pests which they
said were bedbugs, silverfish and cockroaches. They said they reported the
issue to the Landlord’s mother.  They said the Landlord sent a “spiritual person”
to address the issue which was not successful.  The Tenants then arranged for
pest control treatment which has not resolved the issue but reduced the amount
of pests.  
11.  
The Landlord said he sent a
message to the Tenants on May 23rd and a referral for pest control. 

12.  
The Landlord breached
section 20 by failing to treat pests in the unit.  I am satisfied that the
Landlord was aware of the issue.  The Landlord did not provide any evidence of
any pest control inspection or treatment. The Tenants are entitled to the costs
they incurred for pest control treatment.  They submitted an invoice from NH
Pest Control dated June 14, 2018 for $678 paid for the treatment.  The Tenants
said the problem was reduced and therefore an abatement is not appropriate and
also because the Tenants did not provide evidence that they reported the
ongoing issue to the Landlord.
Washroom tiles, stove, patio door lock, fire alarms, range
hood, window screens
13.  
The Tenants said some tiles
in the washroom are broken and the grout is cracked.  The Landlord said he sent
a handyman to the unit who said the tiles have been intentionally broken.  The
Landlord breached section 20 by failing to repair the tiles in the washroom. 
The photos from the Tenants do not indicate that the tiles were intentionally
broken.  The impact to the Tenants is minimal and does not warrant an
abatement.
14.  
The Tenants said the two
larger stove burners stopped working on February 11, 2018.  The stove was
repaired as of July 2018.  The Landlord said the Tenants reported the issue on
July 17th and he arranged for repair the same week.  The Tenants did
not provide evidence about when they reported the issue to the Landlord.  I
prefer the evidence of the Landlord about when the Tenants reported the issue
and find that the Landlord responded in a reasonable amount of time.  The
Tenants are not entitled to an abatement.
15.  
The Tenants said the patio
door does not lock.  The Landlord said the door is capable of being locked. 
The photo from the Tenant shows a close up of one part of the door.  The
Landlord submitted a photo showing a lock present on the patio door.  The
Tenants have not established that this door does not lock.
16.  
The Tenants complained about
missing fire alarms and said the range hood did not work properly and they
purchased a replaced one for which they had no receipts.  The Landlord said
there were always fire alarms present and denies any complaints about the range
hood. The Tenants have not established that there are missing fire alarms or
that they reported any issues regarding the range hood to the Landlord.  The
notes from the property inspector are quite illegible however a part of the
report states that the fire alarms are outdated and not missing.  
17.  
The Tenant said the screens
fall off the bedroom windows.  The Landlord said he has fixed the screens
however the Tenants’ children keep pushing out the screens.  I prefer the
evidence of the Landlord.  It is improbable that window screens would fall off
the windows.
Grass cutting
18.  
The Tenants said the
Landlord did not cut the grass.  The Landlord said he cut the grass except for
May – June because they were out of town.  The Landlord breached section 20 by
failing to cut the grass in May and June.  The Tenants are entitled to an
abatement of $160.00 representing a 5% abatement for May and June 2018.
Regarding L2 application – substantial
interference, damage
19.  
On August 20, 2018, the Tenants were given a
first N5 Notice of Termination under sections 62 and 64 of
the Act.  This N5 notice
did not become void because the Tenants did not correct the problem within the
7 day time period set out in the notice.
20.  
The rental unit consists of the upper level of a
house.  There are other tenants in the lower level of the house.
21.  
Laundry facilities are shared between the
tenants.  The Landlord claims damage to the laundry room door frame.  The
Landlord submitted a photo of a cracked door jamb of the laundry room door.
22.  
The Landlord also testified that the Tenants are
using the garage to store some items and they are not entitled to use this
space.  The Landlord also said the Tenants contacted the City property
standards inspector multiple times.
23.  
The Landlord has listed the house for sale.  He
said the Tenants make prospective buyers wait for one-half an hour before
permitting entry.
24.  
The Landlord said the Tenants are entitled to
one parking space however they park a second vehicle which encroaches the
sidewalk.
25.  
The Tenants deny causing any damage to the
laundry room door.  One of the Tenants said she pushed the door open. The
Tenants said they required a small space for storage of some items which was
agreed to the Landlord’s mother.  The Tenants deny any delay to prospective
buyers. They said the City inspector contacted them about their vehicle
encroaching the sidewalk and the Tenants do not deny contacting the property
standards officer.
26.  
It is more probable than not that the Tenants
caused negligent undue damage to the laundry room door.    The photos
demonstrate that the crack in the door jamb occurred due to some action such as
the Tenants’ admission that they pushed open the door. The Landlord did not
provide evidence to substantiate the amount claimed.
27.  
With regard to the use of the garage, the
written tenancy agreement is silent regarding the use of this space.  However
as the Tenants have some belongings in the garage, it is more probable that
there was an oral or implied agreement when the tenancy commenced regarding the
use of the garage.  The evidence from the Landlord is insufficient to conclude
that the Tenants’ use of space in the garage amounted to substantial
interference.  
28.  
The Landlord has failed to establish substantial
interference regarding any delays to prospective buyers or because the Tenants’
vehicle encroached over the sidewalk.  The letter dated July 5, 2018 from the
Landlord’s real estate agent discloses no issues regarding showings.  In any
event, the letter does not comply with the Act regarding proper notice of
entry.  The text messages itemizing showings do not disclose any conduct by the
Tenants that would support a finding of substantial interference.  The Landlord
has not demonstrated substantial interference with the parking of the Tenants’
vehicle and said that it was not a big issue at the hearing.  As well, the mere
fact that the Tenants contacted the property inspector is insufficient to
constitute substantial interference. 
Regarding Tenants’ T2 application regarding
tenant rights (substantial interference, harassment)
Rent receipts
29.  
The Tenants said the Landlord has not provided them
with rent receipts.
30.  
The Landlord submitted copies of rent receipts
he said he gave to the Tenants.
31.  
I am not satisfied that the Landlord failed to
provide the Tenants with rent receipts.  However the receipts submitted by the
Landlord fail to meet the requirements of section 109 of the Act and section 9
of Ontario Regulation 516/06. This
section requires a receipt for rent payments to include the address of the
rental unit, the name of the tenant, the amount of each payment, the name of
the landlord and the signature of the landlord. The
receipts do not include the address of the rental unit, fail to name the second
tenant and does not state the name of the Landlord.
Substantial
interference and harassment
32.  
The Tenants said the
Landlord’s mother came to the unit daily and on August 20th the
Landlord’s sister came to the entry door and persistently rang the doorbell. 
The Tenants called the police.  They said they had a social gathering on July 1st
and the Landlord’s mother came to the unit for a showing after the Tenants
already had two showings that day.
33.  
The Tenants said that the
Landlord’s mother came to the premises and locked the laundry room door on July
28th because the utility bills were increasing and she also turned
off the air conditioning.  They said the Landlord also unplugged the washer.
The Tenants said she pushed open the laundry room door the following Monday. 
34.  
The Tenants said the
Landlord threatened them that they were responsible for any damage to the unit
and the Landlord’s friends called them telling them to move.
35.  
The Landlord said his mother
lives in the U.S. and could not come to the unit.  The Landlord denies any
complaints regarding his sister.  The Landlord said the downstairs tenants
turned off the air conditioning because they were cold but the Landlord gave
them permission to turn off the breaker later in August.  The Landlord said the
utility bills were increasing because the Tenants were doing laundry daily. 
The Landlord denies any knowledge about the washer plug or any other persons
contacting the Tenants.
36.  
Section 22 of the Act
provides that a landlord shall not substantially interfere with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit for all usual purposes by a tenant.
37.  
Section 23 of the Act
specifies that a landlord shall not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or
interfere with a tenant. Harassment
is generally defined as “a course of conduct which one knows or should know to
be unwelcome by the other person and which one pursues for no legitimate
purpose” (Grimard v. Knight 2006 O.R.H.T.D.).
38.  
The Tenants failed to
demonstrate substantial interference or harassment.  It was evident at the
hearing that the relationship between the parties has soured and although there
was some interference the evidence does not support a finding that it was
substantial.  It is probable that both parties equally contributed to the
issues.
Relief from eviction
39.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants agreed with the amount owed which has been
reduced by the abatement and out of pocket costs incurred by the Tenants.  The
issue regarding the laundry door damage was minor and not such that warrants
eviction.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 and L2 applications:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
3, 2019.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $368.15*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 23, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 24, 2019 to the date the Tenants moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 3, 2019, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 4, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 3, 2019, then starting February 4, 2019, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 4, 2019.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $3,390.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2019, or
ii)       $4,990.00 if the payment is made on or before February 3, 2019**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 4,
2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants
are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
T2 and section 82 issues:
10.  
The Landlord shall provide
the Tenants with rent receipts for all payments made to the Landlord which
comply with section 9 of Ontario Regulation 516/06 on or before February 15,
2019.
11.  
The Landlord shall inspect
and treat the unit for pests on or before February 15, 2019.
12.  
The Landlord shall repair
the washroom tiles on or before February 15, 2019.
