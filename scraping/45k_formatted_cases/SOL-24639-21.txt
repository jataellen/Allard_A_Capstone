Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24639-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


725 CANNON ST E HAMILTON ON L8L2H1


 




Between:


Sultanali Thawer


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dave Baron Meghan Graham


Tenants



 
 
 
Sultanali Thawer (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Meghan Graham and Dave Baron (the
'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant, Meghan Graham attended the hearing.
Determinations:
N5 Notice:
 
1.    
The Tenant has
substantially interfered with the Landlord lawful rights, privilege and
interest of the Landlord having
failed to pay their water
and gas utility
bill. The Tenant
is responsible for utilities costs which have not been paid after
November 2020.
 
Utility costs:
 
2.    
On consent
the application was amended and the Landlord’s damage claim for utilities
filed under section 89 of the Act in
the L2 application is now considered under section
88.2 of the Act. The amount of the claim
remains unchanged.
 
3.    
There’s no dispute the
Tenants failed to pay utilities (water and gas). The Tenants owe the Landlord
$497.87 which is inclusive of cost up to September 9, 2021 which
is the date the Landlord filed his application.




 
N8 Notice:
 
4.    
The
Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Rent
is due on the 15th day of each month and the Tenant has routinely paid by the 20th day of each month because that’s when she received
her child benefit
income from the government.
 
Relief from Eviction:
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.    
The delay in paying
rent is minimal and the Tenants history
shows rent paid by the 20th
or 21st day of each month (5 or 6
days late). The Tenant proposed to
pay the Landlord
$200.00 on
January 5, 2022 towards the utilities costs and commits to pay the outstanding balance
plus the utility
cost incurred after September 9, 2021 to January 31, 2022 within three months. The Tenant
also commits and proposed to pay future utilities as they come due starting
February 1, 2022. The prejudice to the Landlord is minimal because he can apply
under section 78 of the Act if the Tenant does not meet the conditions set out
in the order below.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
is denied if the Tenant
complies with the following
conditions set out in this order:
 
a)    
The Tenants
shall pay the Landlord
the monthly rent charges, in full and on time, on
or before the 20th day of each month for a
twelve-month period starting January 20, 2022 to December 20, 2022.
 
b)    
Starting February
1, 2022, the Tenants shall
pay the Landlord
the monthly utility
costs for water and gas within two weeks after receiving the utility
statement from the Landlord.
 
c)     
The Tenants
shall pay the outstanding balance
of utilities owing to January
31, 2022 on or before March
31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the Tenants fail to
comply with paragraph 1 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants
apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days
after the breach.
 
3.    
On or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$497.87, which represents
utility costs owing to September 9, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this order on or before March 31, 2022,
they will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
