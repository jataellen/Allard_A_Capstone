Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43804-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


451
  ALBERT STREET ESPANOLA ON P5E1K6


 




Between:


Monica Parri


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kerri Lyn Duhaime


Tenant



 
 
Monica Parri (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kerri Lyn Duhaime (the
'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on January 12, 2022 at 1:00pm.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing when the matter was called at 2:10pm.
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s witness, Thomas Perry.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, this is a month to month tenancy
in which the rent is due on the
first of the month in the amount of $814.40.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s L2 application
filed on September 2, 2021 is based on a N12 notice of termination served
to the Tenant on June 30, 2021 with a termination date of August
31, 2021 pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006.
 
4.     Pursuant to subsections 71.1 (1) and (3), the Landlord
filed the declaration required under subsection 72(1)(b) of the Act, at the
time the application was filed and indicated that no other N12 or N13 notices of termination
were served to any of their tenants
within the last two years.
 
5.     Pursuant to section 49.1, the Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's rent on August
31, 2021 in the form of a money order – a copy of which was submitted to the Board.




 
6.    
The Landlord’s describes the
rental unit as a single-family unit; it is a
2.5 bedroom house that is 975 square
feet in size and is occupied by the Tenant. the Landlord’s evidence was she and her spouse sold the rental
unit to Thomas Perry in June 2021. A copy of the purchase and sale agreement was
submitted to the Board. Prior to selling the unit, the Landlord put the Tenant
on notice of her intention to sell the unit. After it was sold, the Landlord
served the Tenant with the N12 notice of termination.
 
7.     After receiving the N12, the Tenant sought a small
extension to September 3, 2021 to vacate the premises
and moving costs which the Landlord agreed
to- although was not
required to accept.
 
8.     The Landlord’s witness, Thomas Perry, testified that
he entered into an agreement of purchase and sale, as the purchaser, with the Landlord
on June 1, 2021 to move into the
rental unit on a permanent basis. While the initial closing date was
September 2021, this was extended as the Landlord awaited to satisfy the
condition of providing vacant possession to the purchaser. He testified that he
currently rents a unit and that his landlord has been reasonable in extending
his lease on a monthly basis until the rental unit becomes available to him but
that he feels his patience is running thin.
 
9.    
The Landlord
seeks a termination of the tenancy
as early as possible.
ANALYSIS
10.  Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
states
 
49 (1) A landlord of a residential complex that contains no more than
three residential units who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale
of the residential complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good
faith requires possession of the residential complex or the unit for the
purpose of residential occupation by,
 
the purchaser;
 
11. 
Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board,
I find that the purchaser genuinely intends to move
into the rental unit and use it for residential purposes. I also find
that the Landlord has met all the requirements under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 with respect to the N12 served pursuant to subsection
49(1) of the Act.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
13.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:




 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
August 31, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
