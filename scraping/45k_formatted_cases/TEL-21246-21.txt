Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21246-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


618, 25 JOHN STREET
W OSHAWA ON L1H8J5


 




Between:


442534 Ontario
  Incorporated


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Beth Bryant


Tenant



 
 
 
442534 Ontario Incorporated (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Beth Bryant (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued by the Board on October 26, 2021 with respect to application TEL- 14584-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the settlement: the Tenant and any guests or other occupants
of the rental unit shall comply with all COVID- 19 rules and protocols set out
by the Landlord relating to masking, distancing capacity and other health and
safety measures. On December 2, 2021 the Tenant was recorded on security camera
speaking with another Tenant of the building lobby with her mask failing to
fully cover her nose as is outlined in the Landlord’s protocols. On December 3,
2021 the Tenant was in the lobby area of the rental complex and was asked by
staff to pull their mask up ensuring
that it also covers their nose. This request was ignored as the
Tenant then proceeded to board the elevator. On December 10, 2021 the Tenant
and was accompanied by a guest through the common area of the building. The
guest was seen failing to comply with the Landlord’s protocols as their mask
was observed below their nose and at points
below their chin. These events constitute a serious breach of the previous
agreement reached with the assistance of the Board.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.

on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
