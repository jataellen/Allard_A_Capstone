Rentperks On Property Management
LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dalton Bonner and Grace Taylor (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Ron Loborec, attended the hearing. As of 10:47 a.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on February
4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlord is not holding
a rent deposit.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of February
4, 2022, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,210.19*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25530-21
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
