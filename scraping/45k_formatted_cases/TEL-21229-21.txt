Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21229-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1552 DAVENPORT CRESCENT KINGSTON ON K7P0M6


 




Between:


Rohan Ram Maria
  Daniel


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Lorie Tibbutt


Tenant



 
 
 
Rohan Ram and Maria Daniel (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lorie
Tibbutt (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on December 10, 2021 with respect to application HOL-12376-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $2275.00 rent
on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$3,706.50 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order HOL-12376-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,806.50 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order HOL-12376-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.    
Since the date of the order, the
Landlords incurred charges of $7.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant
which were returned
NSF and $20.00
for related administration
charges.
 
7.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,275.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 14, 2021 to
January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-12376-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $5,081.50*. This amount represents the rent owing up to
January 7, 2022 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenant and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $74.79
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 19, 2022.
 
 
January 7, 2022

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 19, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
