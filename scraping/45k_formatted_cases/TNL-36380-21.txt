Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36380-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


215, 2181 AVENUE
ROAD TORONTO ON M5M4B8


 




Between:


Imh Pool Xii Lp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Arleen
  Balanquit


Tenant



 
 
 
Imh Pool Xii Lp
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Arleen
Balanquit (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on April 6, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-24348-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Board issued
an order pertaining to application TNL-24348-20 on April 6, 2021 which required the Tenant to make
regularly scheduled payments to the Landlord that were to be applied against
outstanding rental arrears. The order also required the Tenant to continue
making payments of lawful monthly rent for each consecutive month in full, and
on time by the first day of each corresponding month beginning on December 2020
through to and including November 2021.
 
 
2.    
The agreement provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection 78(5)
of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the
breach of the order.
 
 
4.    
Within the subject L4 application the Landlord claims
that the Tenant had not met the following condition as set out in the
order:




File Number: TNL-36380-21
 
▪  “In accordance with Section 2(b) of Order
TNL-24348-20 the tenant
was required to pay their
lawful monthly rent for November on November 1, 2021. The tenant
failed to make their full November
rent payment.”
 
5.    
The Landlord’s application dated
November 30, 2021, was filed by email
and received by the Board on December 12, 2021, which, pursuant to s. 78 (5) of the Act, is more than 30 days after the Tenant failed to meet a
condition set out in order TNL-24348-20. The first alleged breach would have
been in relation to the November 1, 2021 lawful monthly rental payment which
would have required the Landlord to file their application with the Board no
later than December 1, 2021.
 
 
6.    
The Board
does not have jurisdiction to consider this application as it was filed beyond the statutory 30-day period after
the alleged breach had taken place.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
