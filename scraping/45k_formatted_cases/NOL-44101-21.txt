the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 3 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from

of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September

the rental unit on
October 8, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the

rent was $850.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
8, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,773.60*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 8, 2021.

3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
