Order under
Subsection 87(1)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56077-21



In the
  matter of:


328, 67 CARTIER ROAD LONDON ON N5V1G4


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Blaire Gibson


Tenant



 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Blaire Gibson (the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on February
3, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Terry Medeiros,
attended the hearing. As of 9:56 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,125.23.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed. The amount of rent
owing up to October 31, 2021 is $10,740.94.
5.    
The Landlord incurred costs of $201.00
for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
6.    
The NSF charges claimed by the
Landlord related to preauthorized withdrawals or automatic debiting
rather than NSF cheques. Since subsection 87(5) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, does not provide a remedy for a preauthorized
withdrawal or automatic debit that fails due to non-sufficient funds, the
Landlord’s claim for NSF charges is denied.
 
7.     The Landlord collected
a last month’s rent deposit
of $1,125.23 from the Tenant.
This deposit is still
being held by the Landlord
and will be offset against
the amount owing.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit
of $1.04 is owing to the Tenant for the period from December
1, 2020 to October 31, 2021.




File Number: SWL-56077-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $9,614.67, which represents the amount of rent owing up to October
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
