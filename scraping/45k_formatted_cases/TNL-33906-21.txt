Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33906-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 85 HENDERSON AVENUE THORNHILL ON L3T2L1


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Allan Wallace Chase Gould Jeremiah Tomas Jonathan Gould


Tenants



 
 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jonathan Gould, Jeremiah Tomas,
Allan Wallace and Chase Gould
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s representative, J. Paine, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to November
30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective July 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,543.28 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to July 31, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $1,600.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,604.07*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
7, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $50.74
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,932.24** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
