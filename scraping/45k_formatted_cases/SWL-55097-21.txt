Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55097-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


50, 12 GOSHEN STREET TILLSONBURG ON N4G2T8


 




Between:


Teresa Klassen


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gary Hill


Tenant



 
 
 
Teresa Klassen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gary Hill
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 1:23 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented although
properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenant persistently
failed to pay rent when it was due. The Landlord served on the Tenant an N8
notice to terminate on July 1, 2021.
 
2.   
Rent is due on the first
of each month.
 
3.   
As per the N8 Notice, the Tenant
had not paid rent in full by the first of the month seven times.
 
4.   
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1).
 
6.   
The Landlord disclosed that the Tenant
was late an additional five times after the notice
was served. This is not a positive consideration. The Tenant was not
present to disclose any circumstances for me to consider delaying or denying
eviction. As such, relief will not be granted.
