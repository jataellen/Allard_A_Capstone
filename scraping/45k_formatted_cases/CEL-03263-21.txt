Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03263-21



In the matter
of:


1405, 2185
SHERIDAN PARK DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L5K1C7


 




Between:


IMH Pool
VIII


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Lorin Guzman Mesa Luis Soto


 
Tenants



 
 
IMH Pool VIII (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lorin Guzman Mesa and Luis Soto (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Matt Anderson, attended the hearing. As of 10:26 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent as of January 1, 2022 is $2,142.40.
 
4.    
The Tenants paid $2,117.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,117.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenants up to December
31, 2020.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 10, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 10, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,858.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $70.44
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 10, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 11,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 10, 2022, then starting
March 11, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 11, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  $8,704.80 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)   $10,847.20 if the payment is made on or before
March 10, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 11, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
