Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SWL-57272-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
111, 601 BARBER AVENUE
N LISTOWEL ON N4W1S4


 




Between:


Sireg Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Timothy Higdon


Tenant



 
 
 
Sireg Management Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Timothy Higdon (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on April
29, 2021 with respect to application SWL-46380-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $750.00 towards
the arrears on or before
November 15, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$10,297.07 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-46380-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,050.59
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-46380-20 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,119.00 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from October 22, 2019 to January 11, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57272-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-46380-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,732.90*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 17, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$37.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files
the motion by January
28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
