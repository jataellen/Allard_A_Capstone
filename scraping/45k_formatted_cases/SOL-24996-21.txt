Tenant



 
 
 
Lidan He (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Josh Mullin (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:15 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from February 14, 2021 to October
13, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October 31, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent was $650.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from August
15, 2020 to September 24, 2021.




File Number: SOL-24996-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy is terminated as of October 31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,825.02*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 3, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 4, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
