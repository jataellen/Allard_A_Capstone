File Number: SWL-57651-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


117, 230 BRITANNIA STREET STRATFORD ON N5A5Z7


 




Between:


The Corporation Of The City
Of Stratford


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brent Johnson
  Lori Goetz


Tenants



 
 
 
The Corporation Of The City Of
Stratford (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brent Johnson and Lori Goetz (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49576-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1093.00 rent on
or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-49576-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 19, 2022.

3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,460.47*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 8, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$35.93 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February
20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.

The tenant has until February 18, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 18, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
