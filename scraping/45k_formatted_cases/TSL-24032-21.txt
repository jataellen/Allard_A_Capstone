Capreit Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nicol Castillo-Candia (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jason Paine attended the hearing. As of
10:00 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
30, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the
rental unit on September 29, 2021. The
Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.

The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,380.00.
 
4.

has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which was
returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,380.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for
the period from March 20, 2020 to
August 30, 2021.




It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy
is terminated as of September 29, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,365.19*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 29, 2021
and the total charges
related to a NSF cheque
tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 11, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
