Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26206-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


LOWER, 232 MOUNT
PLEASANT STREET BRANTFORD
  ON N3T1V1


 




Between:


Sightlines Holdings Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Allan Sterats Berniss Powless Ryan Powless


Tenants



 
 
 
Sightlines Holdings Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan Powless,
Allan Sterats and Berniss Powless
(the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This hearing took place
by video conference January 19, 2022
 
The Landlord was represented at the hearing
by paralegal Jordan
Nieuwhof.
 
The Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with the notice of hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated to
demolish it. I am satisfied that the Landlord intends in good faith to carry out the demolition. While I am further
satisfied that it is not possible for the Landlord to obtain the necessary permits for the work
at this point in the project,
I am satisfied that the Landlord has taken all reasonable steps to
obtain the necessary permits for this
work.
 
2.     The Landlord paid the Tenant one month’s compensation,
January 04, 2022, in accordance with section
52(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”).
 
3.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,200.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-26206-21
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
12, 2018 to January 31, 2022.
 
5.     The Landlord’s representative was unaware of any
circumstances that would warrant denying or delaying eviction. I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act,
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 12, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order, the amount the Landlord
is holding for the rent deposit and the interest owing
on the deposit exceeds the amount the Tenants owe for compensation by $1,209.76.
 
3.     The Landlord is authorized to offset from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants the following
amounts: $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February
01, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
may collect from the other any money
that becomes owing because of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 12, 2022, then starting
February 13, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
 
February 1, 2022
