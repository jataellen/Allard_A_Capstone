Between:

Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Tippett Park
  Inc


Landlord



 
 
 
Flora Nguyen and Christine
Nguyen (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Tippett Park Inc
(the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by
video conference January 12, 2022.
 
The Tenant Flora Nguyen
attended the hearing.
The Landlord was represented at the hearing
by its agent Jelena Dizdarevic and its paralegal Geoff Paine
 
 
Determinations:
 
Last Month’s
Rent Deposit.
 
1.    
On October 09, 2020 the perspective tenant, Flora Nguyen, began exchanging e-mails
with the Landlord’s leasing agent, Jelena Dizdarevic. The purpose of the e-mail
exchanges was to discuss a possible tenancy agreement.
 
2.     Without viewing the unit, Flora Nguyen filled out an application for the rental unit and paid the
Landlord $1930.00, the equivalent of one month’s rent. Although there was no
lease agreement signed, Flora
Nguyen stated the tenancy was to commence
January 01, 2021.
 
3.     On October 13, 2020 Flora Nguyen viewed the unit for the first time. Christine Nguyen was unavailable and did not view
the unit.
 
4.     On October 17, 2020 the Tenants e-mailed
the Landlord and advised they were no longer
interested in renting the unit.




 
5.    
In response, On October
20, 2020 the Landlord
e-mailed the Tenants
offering two month’s rent free and lowering the rent. The Tenants declined. The tenancy never commenced. The Landlord kept the
Last Month’s Rent Deposit (LMR).
 
6.     The Tenants allege
that because the tenancy never commenced, the Landlord is illegally
retaining their LMR.
 
Analysis
 
7.    
Section 107 (1) of the Act
States as follows:
 
A landlord shall repay the amount
received as a rent deposit
in respect of a rental unit if vacant possession of the
rental unit is not given to the prospective
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 107 (1).
 
8.     In Musilla v. Avcan
Management Inc., 2011 ONCA 502 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal held that s. 107(1)
of the Act does not authorize a tenant to obtain the automatic
return of a rent deposit where the
landlord has done everything necessary to give the possession of the leased
premises and the tenant has unilaterally repudiated the rental agreement.
 
9.    
Based on the Tenants’ October 17,
2020 e-mail, I find it the Tenants unilaterally repudiated the rental agreement. The Landlord’s response of October 20, 2020 indicates the Landlord did everything to
give the Tenants possession of the rental unit and preserve the tenancy.
 
10.  Section 106 (1) of the Act states;
 
A landlord
may require a tenant to pay a rent deposit
with respect to a tenancy
if the landlord does so on or
before entering into the tenancy agreement.
 
11. 
This section of
the Act allows for LMR to be paid prior to entering into a tenancy
agreement. The charge
was equivalent to one month’s
rent. I find the LMR paid to the
Landlord is lawful. Since, the Tenant repudiated the rental agreement, there is
no obligation for the LMR to be returned to the Tenants.
 
12.  Section 16 of the Act states as follows;
 
When a landlord
or a tenant becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy
agreement, the person
entitled to claim the amount has a duty
to take reasonable steps to minimize the person’s losses.
13. 
The Landlord’s agent testified she took steps
to immediately re-rent
the unit. The unit was listed online. A new tenant was found
and took possession of the unit June 01, 2021. I am satisfied the Landlord took reasonable steps to minimize its
loss set out in section 16 of the Act.
