Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18284-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


NORTH UNIT, 1715
SCUGOG LINE 4 PORT PERRY ON L9L1B3


 




Between:


Doug Clark


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Larry Milner Lindsay Leblanc Peter Milner


Tenants



 
 
 
Doug Clark (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Lindsay Leblanc, Larry Milner and Peter Milner (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe;
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in
the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because
they have been persistently late in paying their
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 26, 2021.
Only the Landlord Representative S. Bemrose attended the hearing.
At the hearing,
the Landlord’s representative advised that the Tenant had moved out, and thus,
the Landlord requested the consent
of the Board to withdraw
the Landlord’s L2 application. The Landlord sought an order for arrears only for its L1
Application.
 
Determinations:
 
L2 Application
 
1.    
I consent
to the withdrawal of the Landlord’s L2 application.
 
L1 Application
 
2.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were
required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to July 31, 2021. For the period
of time from April 1, 2021 through
to July 31, 2021, the Tenants have paid a total of $1075.00 in rent.




3.    
Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective May 20, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants
vacated the unit in July 2021.
 
5.    
At the hearing, the Landlord requested to amend the monthly rent on the L1 application from $1575.00 to $1425.00,
which I granted.      The monthly rent is $1,425.00 and the deposit still being
held by the Landlord is $1275.00.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L2 Application
 
1.    The Landlord's L2 application is
withdrawn.
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenancy
is terminated on July 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the
Landlord $3,348.84 which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to July 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest on the
rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
