Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23239-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


6, 780 YORK ROAD GUELPH ON N1E6A6


 




Between:


Guelph Non-profit Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tanya Glenn


Tenant



 
 
 
Guelph Non-profit Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Tanya Glenn (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on June 15, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-15784-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order SOL-23239-21, issued on August
11, 2021. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside
order SOL-23239-21.
 
This motion was heard via videoconference on December 17, 2021. The Landlord’s legal agent, J. Curran, and legal representative, P. Schroeder, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Landlord called B.
Williams to testify.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
Order SWL-15784-20 provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the
tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
The Breach
2.   
For the reasons that follow,
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
did not comply with the terms as outlined in fire order #3966-127 dated March
5, 2020 on or before July 11, 2021.
 
3.   
It was undisputed that an inspection was scheduled to take place on July 15, 2021. On July 13, 2021, the Tenant contacted the
fire department for a pre-inspection to obtain guidance on how to complete the
requirements outlined in the order. The fire inspector, B. Williams, notified
her that since they were scheduled to attend her unit on July 15, 2021, they
would




 
not be attending
prior to the inspection. However, the Tenant could provide pictures of her
unit. The Tenant did not provide pictures.
 
4.   
The Tenant disputed
that she failed to comply with the Inspection order. She testified that she spent a lot of time trying to ensure compliance by removing or throwing
out belongings, making egresses, etc. While B. Williams informed
her that she could send photos of her unit, the Tenant experienced difficulties
sending them via email. As such, the Tenant believed the fire inspector would
provide some leeway with the inspection. On July 15, 2021, B. Williams,
attended the unit. After the inspection, he notified her that she failed.
 
5.   
The Landlord
submitted that the Tenant was required to arrange for a pre-inspection in June 2021, but she did not attempt
to do so until two days prior to the inspection. Even when the Tenant was permitted to send
photographs, she did not do so and did not notify the fire inspector that she
could not.
 
6.   
B. Williams testified
that he is a fire prevention officer with the city of Guelph, and he has been
in this role for four years. He was involved in the initial inspection that
gave rise to SWL-15784-20. On July 15, 2021,
he conducted an inspection of the Tenant’s
unit and noted the following infractions:
•        
the combustible
materials are piled within 1 meter of the ceiling in the mechanical 3rd floor
room;
•        
a meter clearance around
the furnace and water heater
has not been provided;
•        
a 1-meter
clearance for egress in bedroom
has not been provided;
•        
combustibles in
stairwell;
•        
a 1-meter path of
egress from back door to common egress route at back of patio not provided; and
•        
new concern
of combustibles within
a meter of gas meter
in the backyard.
 
7.   
B. Williams notified
the Landlord of these infractions via email on July 15, 2021, attaching
photographs. The email and photographs were submitted into evidence. In cross,
B. Williams testified that while he did not measure whether there was a 1-meter
distance, he did not need to use a measuring tool to see that the Tenant was in
breach.
 
8.   
On a balance of
probabilities, I find that the Tenant was in breach of the order. Whether or
not B. Williams actually measured a 1-meter distance is immaterial, as I find him
to be a credible and reliable witness and a knowledgeable person in his field.
Further, I find the photographs also demonstrate that the Tenant was in breach.
Many of the photographs showed a substantial number of items, items touching
the ceiling, and items in the stairwell. As such, I find that the Tenant
was in breach of the order.
 
Unfair to Set Aside
 
9.   
The remaining issue
before me is whether I am “satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances,
that it would not be unfair to set aside the order” pursuant to subsection
78(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
10. The Tenant submitted that she is confident
she corrected the issues since the breach that gave rise to the Landlord’s L4 Application. She has a condition that makes organization




 
difficult. She has tried her best to comply with the Inspection
orders but the instructions regarding compliance have been confusing. On the
Wednesday before this hearing, she enrolled in the Acute Intervention Program
to assist with her organization. If I denied her motion, she stated she would
be homeless as she would not be able to afford market rent in the city. She
would also lose custody of her 7-year-old child if she did not have a home. She
has resided in this unit for eight years.
 
11. The Landlord submitted that the Tenant
has not made any appreciable changes since Order SWL-15784-20. B. Williams testified
that another inspection of the Tenant’s unit was done on October 25, 2021. Photographs of his inspection were submitted into evidence. He found
that, among other things, combustibles were not reduced by 30%, there was an
accumulation of combustibles throughout the unit, combustibles were still
within 1-meter of the ceiling, and combustibles in the backyard increased
substantially. Another inspection was scheduled for December 6, 2021 but the Tenant
was not present and changed
the locks so the inspection
could not take place. B. Williams further submitted that the Tenant’s unit is
dangerous in that if a fire were to occur, it could cause a substantial fire to
spread to neighbouring units.
 
12. In addition, the Tenant has not made
meaningful steps in getting assistance. J. Curran testified that she had offered the Tenant the Acute Intervention Program, a Housing
Support Worker and a contractor who could assist
with disposing items.
Only the Wednesday before the hearing did the Tenant engage the services of the
Acute Intervention Program.
 
13. I find it would be unfair to set aside this order.
While the Tenant
submits that she has made attempts to organize the items in her
unit, it appears that many opportunities have been given to her so that she
could comply with the fire inspection order, but she has not. The Tenant was
afforded an opportunity to get a pre-inspection before July 15, 2021, for which
she did not try to utilize until a couple
days prior to the inspection. Thereafter, at the October
25, 2021 inspection, B. Williams
did not find any meaningful change. She had also failed
to utilize any of the programs
offered to her until a few days before this hearing. Further,
based on B. Williams’ testimony, it appears the Tenant’s unit poses a
fire hazard, demonstrating significant prejudice to the Landlord and to the
health and safety of other occupants of the residential complex.
 
14. However, in consideration of the Tenant’s
health, length of tenancy, and her child, I find it would not be unfair to postpone
lifting the stay until February
28, 2022. This will provide
the Tenant with some time to organize her move and find alternative
housing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside
Order SOL-23239-21, issued
on August 11, 2021, is denied.
 
2.     The stay of order SOL-23239-21 is lifted on February 28, 2022.
