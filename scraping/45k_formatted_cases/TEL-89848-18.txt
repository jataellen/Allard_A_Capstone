N.A.R. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict B.A. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 26, 2018.
2.    
At the commencement of the
hearing the Landlord indicated there was a possible consent between the
parties; however, he was unsure whether the Tenant still consented to an order
with standard terms with a delay to May 31, 2018.
3.    
The Tenant stated he is
self-employed and that in January 2018 he was hit by a garbage truck.  This
accident has set him back considerably and he is just recently getting back
into his job.  He requested a repayment plan that would continue for over a
year.
4.    
The Landlord stated that the
last payment received by the Tenant was in December 2017 in order to void a
previous order for non-payment of rent.  Since this time, no payment has been
received.  The Tenant’s response was that it was Christmas time and he expected
to make a payment after he was paid for a project he had completed.  
5.    
The Landlord further said
that the proposed repayment plan by the Tenant would be highly prejudicial to
the Landlord as the Tenant has provided no evidence to support any such plan.
6.    
I am inclined to agree with
the Landlord.  Although the Tenant said he would be able to give the Board a
copy of what he has made in the past, this does not predict the future.  The
arrears are substantial and the Tenant failed to lead sufficient evidence to
support his repayment plan or any payment for that matter.  
7.    
As the Tenant stated at the
hearing, he could just use the money he has as payment of first and last
month’s rent at a new location.  
8.    
I am not satisfied that a
repayment plan is viable in this circumstance.  For this reason, an order with
standard terms with a delayed termination of May 31, 2018 is granted.
9.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,497.80 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
10.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from February 1, 2018 to March 26, 2018.
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until May 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act.
12.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 31,
2018.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,750.62*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $49.37 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 17, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 31, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2018.
8.    
If, on or before May 31,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,130.67** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
