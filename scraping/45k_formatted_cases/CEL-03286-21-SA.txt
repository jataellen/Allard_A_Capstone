Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03286-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


4, 80 JAMES STREET
EAST ORILLIA ON L3V1L2


 




Between:


Nir Lefler


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Colleen Kirbyson
  Wade Boxall


Tenants



 
 
 
Nir Lefler (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colleen
Kirbyson and Wade Boxall (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on March 29, 2021 with respect to
application CEL-95955-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order CEL-03286-21, issued on November 18, 2021.
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order CEL-03286-21.
 
This motion
was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
It is uncontested that the Tenants
breached a condition
of order CEL-95955-20 by failing to pay the
Landlord $315.16 toward arrears on October 1, 2021.
 
2.     It is also uncontested that the Tenants
paid this amount on October
12, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants paid rent on time for November 2021 (by then the arrears covered by order CEL-95955-20 were paid off) and paid rent for December 2021 late. As of the date of the
hearing, the Tenants had not paid rent for January 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant CK testified
that the Tenants
can pay rent for January
2022 any time and can pay rent for February 2022 by February
4, 2022.
 
5.     The Tenants have an 8 month old baby living
with them and on weekends
they have three school aged children living with them. They
moved into the unit 2.5 years ago.




File Number: CEL-03286-21-SA
 
6.    
The Landlord opposed this motion
on the basis that the Tenants have repeatedly paid their rent late and the Tenants
are not keeping
the unit in a state
of ordinary cleanliness.
 
7.     I am satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances,
that it would not be unfair to set aside the order and replace the original
order with a new order that requires the Tenants to pay the arrears
and pay the rent for February. The prejudice to the Landlord
is minimal. The amount owed
at this point is one month of rent and this can be addressed by amending the
original order. To ensure that the Tenants do not shift the one month of
arrears from January to February, this order will also require the Tenants to pay
the rent for February. To the extent that there are other issues in the
tenancy, these can be resolved by the Landlord serving the appropriate notices
of termination and filing an application. The prejudice to the Tenants if this
motion is denied would be much greater given that they have a baby.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants’ motion to set aside order CEL-03286-21 is granted.
 
2.     Order CEL-03286-21, issued
on November 18, 2021, is cancelled.
 
3.     Order CEL-95955-20, issued by the Board on March 29, 2021, is cancelled and is
replaced with the following:
 
4.     On or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants
shall pay the rent in full for January 2022.
 
5.    
On or before February
4, 2022, the Tenants shall pay the rent in full for February 2022.
 
6.     If the Tenants
fail to make any of the payments pursuant to this order,
in full and on time, the
Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenants, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The
Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’
failure to make a payment.
