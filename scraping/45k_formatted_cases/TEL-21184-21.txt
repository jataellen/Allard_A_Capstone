Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21184-21
In the matter of:      1914, 15 HARDING
AVENUE
NORTH YORK ON M6M0A4
 
Between:                  Medallion Corporation                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Annastashia Ter Lambert                                                                                                                     Tenant
 
On November 24, 2021, Medallion
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Annastashia Ter Lambert (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on August 6, 2021 with respect to application HOL-09598-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to
the Landlord $500.00
of arrears on or before November
5, 2021 and November 19, 2021. These
were breaches of the previous order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$6,383.92 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order HOL-09598-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,883.92
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order HOL-09598-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has also failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from November
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,450.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from June 15, 2020
to January 17, 2022.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order HOL-09598-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,865.72*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $47.67 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting
December 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant actually
moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion

and the Board will schedule a hearing.

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
