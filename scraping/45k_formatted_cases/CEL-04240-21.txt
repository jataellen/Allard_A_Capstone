Donald Regimbald Susan Regimbald


Tenants




 
On November 23, 2021, Jasmar Investments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Susan Regimbald and Donald Regimbald
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on July 19, 2021 with respect to application CEL-98641-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$525.00 on or before November
20, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$10,936.15 for rent arrears in Order CEL-98641-21. The amount that is
still owing from that order
is $7,861.15 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-98641-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September
1, 2018 to January 17, 2022.




File Number: CEL-04240-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order CEL-98641-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,814.57*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.65 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the
Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
