Toronto Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate

Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated settlement issued
by the Board on January 31, 2020 with respect to application TEL-79285-17.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The mediated settlement provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the settlement.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the settlement: The Tenant failed to pay $100.00 towards
the arrears, on or before December 20, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 12, 2022, then starting February
13, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
