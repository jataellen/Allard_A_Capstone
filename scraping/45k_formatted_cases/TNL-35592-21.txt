Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35592-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


314 DORCHESTER STREET NEWMARKET ON L3Y6N7


 




Between:


Mahan
  Habibi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Reilly Macdonald


Tenant



 
 
 
Mahan Habibi (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Reilly Macdonald (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 13:32 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly notified of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with N5 and N7 notices of termination by sending them via text messages.
 
2.     Section 191 of the Act establishes how a notice may be given, which include the Rules of the Board. The Act and the Rules do not permit service of notices via text
messages unless there is prior consent of the Board for an alternative form of
service.
As a result, service
of the notices is defective, and the application cannot proceed.
