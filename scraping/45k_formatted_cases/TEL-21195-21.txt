Jameel Ahmed
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris
Lockhart and Michele Lockhart (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to
meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on November 3, 2021 with respect to application TEL- 17816-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay the lawful
rent for November 2021 on or before
November 1, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 23, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.
