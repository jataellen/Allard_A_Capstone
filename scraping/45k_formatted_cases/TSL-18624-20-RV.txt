Order under
Section 21.2 of the
Statutory Powers Procedure
Act
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-18624-20-RV
 
 



In the
  matter of:


201, 301 LANSDOWNE AVENUE TORONTO ON M6K2W5


 




Between:


The Village
Loft Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Moises Matos


Tenants



 
 
 
 
The Village Loft Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard Matos and Moises
Matos (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related
administration charges. The application was resolved by order TSL-18624-20
issued on August 11, 2021.
 
On October 13, 2021,
the Tenant Richard
Matos requested that order be reviewed and that the order be stayed until their request to
review is resolved.
 
The Tenant Richard Matos alleged that he was not able to reasonable participate in the hearing
as he did not receive the notice of hearing.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 20, 2021.
 
The Landlords Agent David Vit and the Tenant
Richard Matos attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     In this request
for review the Tenant Richard
Matos indicates that he was unaware of the
hearing because the Notice of Hearing was not sent to him. He states that he has not lived in the
unit nor had contact with the other Tenant Moises Matos since at least 2012.
 
2.    
The Landlord confirmed that they have never had any contact
with Richard Matos since
they purchased the residential complex in 2009. The Landlord further stated
that whenever they had issues with the Tenant Moises Matos, they could call a
third person for assistance. However,
recently that person was no longer assisting Moises Matos.




 
3.    
Case law instructs that whether a
party was able to reasonably participate in a hearing should be interpreted broadly
to ensure natural
justice and where a party shows that they
genuinely intended to participate in a hearing but was prevented from doing so,
be entitled to a hearing.
 
4.     I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that
the named Tenant Richard Matos was
not reasonably able to participate in the hearing on basis that he was not
served a copy of the notice
of hearing. I say this because the obligation is not on the other
Tenant to serve a Notice of Hearing or other documents. In this instance it would appear that the tenancy had been assigned to Moises Matos and that as a
result Richard Matos was no longer a Tenant.
The Landlord confirmed
having no contact
with Ricard Matos and therefore
ought to have known that he was not the lawful tenant.
 
5.     Therefore, the request
for review is
granted.
 
6.    
The Tenant Moises Matos
has not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 24,
2020.
 
7.     The Tenant Richard
Matos requested to have the application amended
to remove his name.
This was not opposed by the Landlord, and therefore is granted.
 
8.     The Landlord requested
to convert the L1 application to an L9 application for arrears only. The Tenant Moises Matos was
lawfully evicted on October 6, 2021.
 
9.     The Tenant Moises
Matos was a Tenant at the time that the application was
filed.
 
10.  The monthly rent was $1,450.00.
 
11.  The Landlord incurred
charges of $14.00
for 2 cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.
 
12.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,450.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
13.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2019 to October 24, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The application is amended to remove Richard
Matos as a party.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant Moises Matos
is terminated as of
October 6, 2021, the date the Tenant was lawfully evicted.




 
3.    
The Tenant Moises Matos shall pay
to the Landlord $18,692.89*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 6, 2021 and the total charges related to NSF cheques
tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant Moises
Matos shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant Moises Matos does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant Moises
Matos will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
