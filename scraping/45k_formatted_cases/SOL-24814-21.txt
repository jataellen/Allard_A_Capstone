Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24814-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 2578 GARRISON ROAD RIDGEWAY ON L0S1N0


 




Between:


Steven Cruz


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cody Capi
Megan Mountain-Larocque


Tenants



 
 
 
 
Steven Cruz (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Megan
Mountain-Larocque and Cody Capi (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent; and because
the Tenants, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenants permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
This application was heard by video conference on January 5, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenants
did not attend
the hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. I waited
over an hour, and
then I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.   
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with two N5 notices of termination, as well as an N8 notice of termination.
 
3.    I found that all the Landlord’s notices of
termination were fatally flawed, as there was no unit number listed. Subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) provides that a notice of termination shall identify the rental
unit for which the notice is given.
 
4.   
Since the notices of termination for this application were not valid, I dismissed the Landlord’s application.
