Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-42435-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


402, 277 NORTHERN AVENUE EAST SAULT
  STE. MARIE ON P6B6E1


 




Between:


The Columbus Club Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chelsey Williams


Tenant



 
 
 
The Columbus Club Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Chelsey Williams (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard on February
7, 2022. The Landlord’s representative Kathy McIntyre
attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Matters:
 
The Tenant had signed in for the
hearings that began at 9:00am. At
1:20 when the application was heard the Tenant was not in attendance. All of the rooms were checked at that time by me as well as the moderator. The Landlord’s representative informed me
that the Tenant had possibly met with Duty Counsel Marcos Gomez. The rooms were also checked to find Mr.
Gomez but he could not be
located. After neither could be
located, the hearing proceeded without the Tenant. After the hearing concluded the Tenant came to the hearing room. She informed me she was meeting with Duty
Counsel. As we had searched for the
Tenant in all possible locations where Mr. Gomez or any other Duty Counsel would have been meeting with a
tenant and the Tenant could not be located. I
made the determination the Tenant chose not to attend the hearing but instead
call in after the hearing had concluded and issue the following order. I also note that this application was
previously adjourned in October 2021 and that the application was filed on
March 24, 2021.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant’s downstairs neighbour Kelly Leveque, and neighbour on the same
floor as the Tenant Cheryl
Pelletier, testified at the hearing.
Both confirmed that the Tenant
has




 
loud fights, arguments, slamming
doors, dragging furniture, men coming and going
frequently, and loud music at parties on nearly a daily basis.
 
2.     The witnesses believe there is excessive drug use in
the Tenant’s unit. The police have
been to the unit many times and their testimony
even had the Tenant asking the police for
the drugs to be returned that they had seized.
 
3.     The testimony shows
that this is happening at all hours
of the day and night which
supports the Landlord’s allegations.
 
4.     The witnesses testified that the situation
is totally unbearable and the do not feel safe as this behaviour continues.
 
5.     I find this conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants'
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$4,257.84, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from March 13, 2021 to
February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $12.56 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
