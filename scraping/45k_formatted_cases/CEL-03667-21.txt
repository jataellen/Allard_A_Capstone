Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
CEL-03667-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
252 HUTCHINSON DRIVE
ALLISTON, NEW TECUMSETH ON L9R1V2


 




Between:


Marco Khalil


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Annica Smith


Tenant



 
 
 
Marco Khalil (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Annica Smith (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 application’).
The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant (the ‘L2/N5
application’). The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the
Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage (the ‘damage claim’).
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation (the ‘L2/N12 application’).
 
The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant
to compensation the Landlord
unpaid utilities costs (the ‘utilities claim’).
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s legal representative, Yasmin
Van Maurik, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application
 
1.       
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on January
1, 2022.




 
2.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 1, 2022.
 
3.       
The Landlord incurred charges
of $60.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
4.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,550.00 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
5.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from December
22, 2020 to September 26,
2021, in the amount of $1.95.
 
6.       
The Tenant paid $2,550.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.       
As the Tenant has vacated the rental unit, the Landlord
is only seeking an order for the outstanding arrears. An order will
issue accordingly.
 
The Applications That Are Moot
 
8.       
As the Tenant has vacated the
rental unit, the L2/N12 application is now moot and the L2/N5 application is moot. The only remaining
issues on the Landlord’s application is the damage claim
and the claim for unpaid utilities.
 
The Damage Claim
 
9.       
The Landlord’s Application includes
these four damage
claims:
 
a)    
Damage to the main floor carpet
which was fouled by the Tenant’s dog,
 
b)    
Damage to the kitchen
counter,
 
c)     
Damage to the main entrance, and
 
d)    
Flooring and drywall damage
caused by flooding
in the basement
 
10.    The claim for any damage
to the carpet was withdrawn by the Landlord
at the hearing. For this reason, this portion of the Landlord’s
application is denied.
 
11.    The Landlord presented photographs of what was alleged
to be damage to the kitchen
counter located on the main floor of the rental unit. The evidence presented
was not compelling enough to suggest that any damage had occurred to the
kitchen counter outside of normal wear-and-tear. For these reasons, this
portion of the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
12.    Regarding the damage allegedly caused to the rental
unit entrance, while the Landlord did submit a picture of the doorway which
showed some minor scratches, this does not constitute undue damage as required by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). For this reason, this portion of the Landlord’s
application is dismissed.




 
13.   
The Landlord claims that there was
significant flood in the basement area of the rental unit. The Landlord said that the laminate flooring
in the basement was so damaged by the
flood that he removed a large area of flooring and he will have to replace all of
the flooring in the basement. In
support of his testimony, the Landlord provided photos of the area of concrete
basement flooring where he says he needed to remove the laminate slats. The
Landlord also provided pictures of the baseboards in the basement and other
areas of concrete flooring in the basement.
 
14.    Although the outline of the removed laminate pieces
can be seen on the concrete floor, these pictures do not show any damage
to the concrete floor
at all. The Landlord failed to provide any pictures of the laminate
pieces which he says were damaged by water. We would also note that the
Landlord was unable to provide a reasonable explanation for failing to provide pictures
of the damage to the laminate flooring, even though this area of damage was the focus of his
application.
 
15.    Also, although there
appears to be a small amount of discolouration on the
baseboards in the basement, and there
is a small area of sitting water on the concrete floor underneath the laundry
room sink, none of the basement pictures confirm that undue damage was caused
in any part of the basement due to an alleged flood. In fact, none of the
Landlord’s pictures confirm the Landlord’s testimony that a significant flood
occurred. At most, there appears to have been small area of
water at some point in the basement,
but we are not satisfied that this caused undue damage to any part of the
basement. For these reasons, and based
on the evidence before us, we are not
satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that the Tenant wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to
the rental unit and this portion of the Landlord’s application must be
dismissed.
 
The Utilities Claim
 
16.   
The Landlord claims that the Tenant has not paid the utilities that were required
to be paid as according to the
lease agreement. In support of his testimony, the Landlord provided the Board
with copies of several utility bills which appear to be unpaid.
 
17.    According to the Landlord’s documentary evidence, the Tenant
currently owes the following utility costs:
 
a)    
$566.54 for Enbridge Gas from May 14, 2021 to Nov. 30, 2021
 
b)    
$424.24 for New Tecumseth
Water from April 24, 2021 to Oct. 31, 2021.
 
18.    The Landlord is seeking a total of $990.78 in unpaid utilities.
 
19.    The Residential Tenancies
Act section 88.1 states:
 
A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant or former tenant to pay costs described in
subsection (4) if,




 
(a) while the tenant
or former tenant
is or was in possession of the rental unit, the tenant or former tenant
failed to pay utility costs that they were required to pay under the terms of
the tenancy agreement
 
20.    Based on all of the evidence before us, we are
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Tenant failed
to pay the utility costs he was required to pay and this portion of the Landlord’s
application should be granted.
 
21.    This order contains
all the reasons
within it and no further
reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
was terminated on January 1, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $7,820.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 1, 2022, and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered
to the Landlord by or on behalf
of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.       
The tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$990.78 for the unpaid utilities
claimed by the Landlord.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.       
If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
