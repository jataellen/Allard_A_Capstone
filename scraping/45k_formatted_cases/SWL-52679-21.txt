Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-52679-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


325 WALLACE AVENUE N LISTOWEL ON N4W1L2


 




Between:


The Kitchen Cupboard and Icebox
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Brooker-Illman


Tenant



 
 
The Kitchen Cupboard and Icebox
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Michelle Brooker-Illman (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord intends to convert
the rental unit to a non-residential use. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 12, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Kirsten Maczko and the Tenant was represented by Aron Van de Kleut. Evidence was provided by the
Landlord and the Tenant.
 
At the end of the hearing on
November 12, 2021, I permitted the parties to make written submissions within
five days. On November 17, 2021, Ms
Maczko wrote to me asking if the parties could have until December 3, 2021 to
make written submissions because they were attempting to settle the matter. I granted that request. No written submissions appear to have been received
from Ms Maczko or Mr. Van de Kleut and there is no indication on CMORE that the
matter was settled. I am, as a
result, making this order without the benefit of written submission.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On June 26, 2021, the Landlord
served an N13 notice with a termination date of October 31, 2021. This application was filed on July 5, 2021.
 
2.     The parties agree that all of the technical requirements of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') in terms of the notice and the payment of compensation to the Tenant
have been satisfied.
 
3.    
Pursuant to a
consent order that was made in SWL-45399-20 on June 24, 2021, the lawful monthly
rent for the rental unit is $704.29,
but a prompt payment discount
reduces




 
that to $690.00. It is my understanding that the monthly
rent payable by the Tenant is
$690.00
 
4.     I am satisfied that the Landlord requires the rental
unit to be vacated by the Tenant in order to convert it to a non-residential
purpose.     The Landlord wishes to use the rental unit for commercial purposes
and, in particular, for purposes related to her growing housewares business and
for storage. The unit is zoned for
commercial use. While the Landlord intends
to make changes
to the rental unit, there
was no evidence that this work
requires permits or other authority.
 
 
5.     The Landlord freely conceded that she is not happy with the tenancy and there have been issues collecting rent and utilities
from the Tenant such that the relationship between the Landlord and the Tenant
has ‘fallen apart’.
The Landlord also conceded that the market rent of the rental unit is
about $930.00. I have considered this
evidence in finding that the Landlord in good faith intends to convert the
rental unit to a commercial purpose such that she satisfies the requirement of
paragraph 50(1)(b) and section 73 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
6.     There was no evidence
that the Landlord had any urgent need for
the rental unit.
 
7.     The Tenant moved into the rental unit in August
of 2016. She has one teenage daughter who lives with her in the unit.
 
8.     The Tenant has a medical condition.
 
9.     The Tenant has applied for disability benefits and is
currently receiving assistance from Ontario Works. She is anticipating returning to the workforce
when she is medically able to do so.
 
10.  I appreciate that, based on her medical condition, the
Tenant will need additional time and assistance to pack her belongings
and move, but I do not believe, based on the evidence, that the Tenant’s medical condition is such that
fairness would dictate that I deny eviction. Instead,
I find that it is appropriate
to provide the Tenant with additional
time to vacate the rental unit.
 
11.  The Tenant indicated that she has begun the process of
packing her belongings in preparation to move.
While she indicated that she cannot afford to hire movers and her
daughter is not available to assist very much, the Tenant’s evidence was that
she has family and friends
that are willing
to assist her, and that have in fact been assisting her to pack her belongings. There was no evidence that the Tenants
have requested assistance or accommodation from the Landlord.
 
12.  The Tenant indicated that she has been looking for
alternate rental accommodations, but cannot afford to pay market rent. She also indicated that she had made
inquiries with respect to subsidized housing, but was told that subsidized
housing was not a viable option given the length of the waiting list.            The Tenant indicated that her current
plan is to




 
purchase a trailer in which she
can live and is actively looking for one.   She further indicated that she has a place to put a trailer
once she finds one and has the ability to move a trailer to that location.
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and, as noted above,
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
14.  The Tenant indicated
during direct examination that she believed
that this application was brought in retaliation for a prior
dispute she had with the Landlord. In
particular, she asserted that this application was in retaliation for the
consent order that was made in SWL-45399-20.
While there was no direct reference to this provision of the Act, I take
from this line of questioning that the Tenant is asking me to deny the
Landlord’s application based on paragraph 83(3)(c) of the Act.
 
15.  The Tenant asked a few general questions with respect
to whether the Landlord was happy with the tenancy, but no questions were asked
with respect to any connection between this application and any attempt(s) by the Tenant to secure or enforce
her legal rights.
 
16.  Aside from the timing
of the consent order made in SWL-45399-20 and the serving of the N13 notice that resulted
in this application, there is, in my view based on the evidence, no readily-apparent connection between
this application and any attempts by the tenant to secure or enforce her legal
rights. It is not even clear to me
what legal rights the Tenant was attempting to secure or enforce in
SWL-45399-20 that resulted in the consent order that was made on June 24, 2021. Timing alone is not sufficient to
establish that an application has been brought because a tenant has attempted to secure or enforce his or her legal rights so as to trigger
paragraph 83(3)(c) of the Act.
 
17.  At the end of the hearing, after the evidence was
submitted, the Landlord indicated that there was a request pending to evict the
Tenant based on a breach of the consent order made in SWL-45399-20, but there was no information before me on that request
and the issue was not before
me.
 
18.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $675.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord. Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2021 to
October 31, 2021.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     To the extent that she has not already done so, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,162.26, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1,
2021




 
to January
20, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     To the extent that she has not already done so or does
not do so, the Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $22.68
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January
21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the rental unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
