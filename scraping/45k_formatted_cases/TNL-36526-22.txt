Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36526-22
 



In the matter
of:


905, 855 ROSELAWN AVENUE TORONTO ON M6B4C3


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Trayes


Tenant



 
 
Toronto Community Housing (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daniel
Trayes (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on April 19, 2021 with respect to
application TNL-24235-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay $100.00 towards
the arrears, on or before
January 1, 2022. The
Tenant failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before January 1,
2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $6,251.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-24235-20. The amount that is still owing
from that order is $6,251.00 and that
amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-24235-20
is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-24235-20 is cancelled.

2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $13,586.36*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 24, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.31 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.
