In the matter
of:


903, 555 THE WEST
MALL TORONTO ON M9C1G8


 




Between:


IMH Pool IV LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Csaba
Ruszo Edina Botos


Tenants



 
 
 
IMH Pool IV LP
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Csaba
Ruszo and Edina Botos (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 1, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Tricia Radam, attended the hearing. As of 11:19 a.m., the
Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2020 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,334.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,334.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to April 17, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $13,642.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$5,761.62*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $76.73 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16,
2022 at .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,214.56** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after January 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
