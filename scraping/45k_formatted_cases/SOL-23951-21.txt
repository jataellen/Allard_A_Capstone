In the matter
of:


73 ROBINS AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8H4N3


 




Between:


D.d.c.o. Rei Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amy Norton


Tenant



 
 
 
D.d.c.o. Rei Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Amy Norton (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on November 10, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent D. Distefano and the Landlord’s agent K. Farrell attended
the hearing. The Tenant did
not attend the hearing, although properly served with notice of hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord brought
this application, on the basis the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit and has substantially interfered with another
tenant’s or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex
and/or lawful rights, privileges, or interests.
 
2.     The tenancy commenced
May 28, 2019. The monthly
rent is $2,400.00.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Form N5
contains a notice of termination of August 12, 2021 and alleges, among other
things, that the Tenant damaged the front door glass window insert, the
bathroom mirror, three interior doors, walls, ceilings and other items. In
addition to seeking the Tenant’s eviction from the unit, the Landlord also
seeks $2,260.00 in damages since the Tenant has not repaired the damaged
property.
 
4.    
For the reasons
outlined below, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit or residential
complex.




 
 
 
 
5.    
The Landlord inspected
the rental unit in January 2021 and discovered the front door glass insert was
destroyed. The front door glass insert damage is exclusive to the Tenant’s unit
and the Landlord produced photographic evidence showing much of the glass insert
shattered and held together by large grey duct tape. In light of the location
of the damage and the response given to the Landlord by the Tenant that the
damage was caused by a box that “fell into it”, I am prepared to draw the
inference that the Tenant or someone she permitted in the unit caused this
damage.
 
6.    
A few months later on
July 20, 2021, the Landlord’s agent attended at the property and discovered
significant damage to the interior doors, ceiling and portions of the interior
walls. The Landlord submitted
pictures showing what appeared to be punch/kick holes on the interior doors, ceiling and walls; as well as, drawings
on the interior walls. The damage is
all contained within the Tenant’s unit. In the absence of an alternative
explanation, I am prepared to draw the inference that the Tenant or someone
they permitted in the unit caused this damage wilfully, and due to its
extensive nature, I find that it is undue.
 
Repair Costs
 
7.     Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”) allows a
landlord to apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant
to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the
repair of, or where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue
damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is
in possession of the rental unit. To
succeed on the damages portion of the claim, the Landlord must show that the
damage is “undue”, meaning it is beyond normal wear and tear, and considered to
be excessive or unnecessary.
 
8.     As noted above, due to the nature of the
damage to the front door glass window insert, the interior doors,
the walls and the ceiling
holes, I find that the damage is not caused by normal wear and tear and is
indeed, undue.  The Landlord produced
a breakdown of costs as follows: $ 250.00 to repair the front door glass window
insert; $ 900.00 to repair the interior doors;
$ 500.00 to repair the walls and ceiling holes,
for a total cost of
$1650.00. I find these cost amounts to be reasonable in the circumstances.
 
9.    
The Landlord also
submitted that the Tenant caused damage to the bathroom mirror; two gate
latches; the side gate; the outdoor water tap handle; the bathroom towel rod;
the toilet paper rod; the shower curtain; the shower rod and hooks; the window
screen; and, the furnace filter. Very little evidence was given as to these
alleged damages. This portion of the
Landlord’s claim for damages is denied.
 
Interference with Reasonable Enjoyment
 
10.  Given my finding that the Landlord has
proven on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit, I
need not make a finding as to




 
whether the Tenant’s behaviour or the behaviour of someone visiting
or living with the Tenant has substantially interfered with another tenant or
landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and/or lawful
rights, privileges or interests.
 
11.  Section 83 requires that we consider all
the circumstances in the case, including the Tenants’ and the Landlord’s
situations, to determine if it would be appropriate to delay or deny eviction
in the form of section 83 relief. The Landlord mentioned that the Tenant does
have children, and that there are significant arrears in rent. I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,650.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,984.94, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from August 13, 2021 to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $78.90
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
