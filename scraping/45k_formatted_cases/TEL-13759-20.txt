Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David D'aoust


Tenant



 
 
 
Jung Kyu Kim (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David D'aoust (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. ;
because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
25, 2022. The Landlord
and his son Jong Kim attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent. The Tenant
has not paid January rent.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
6, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.

3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
