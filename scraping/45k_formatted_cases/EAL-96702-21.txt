Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-96702-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


46
STOKES CRESCENT OTTAWA ON
  K2L2Z5


 




Between:


Kewal Dogra


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Adnan Z. Alam Pierre Arseneault


Tenants



 
 
 
Kewal Dogra (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Pierre Arseneault and Adnan Z. Alam (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 10, 2021.
 
At 2:08 pm, the Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative Ahmad Alzameli attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The rental unit is a 3-bedroom unit in a row house
style complex.
 
2.     The Tenant is still in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The tenancy began on or around
2016 and the monthly rent is $1400.00.
 
Deemed Assignment
 
4.    
It was the testimony of the Landlord
that the tenancy
originally started in 2015 with Adnan Alam and that he moved out in 2016
and Pierre Arseneault moved into the rental unit. The Landlord indicated that
Mr. Adnan transferred the occupancy of the rental unit to Mr. Arsenault in a
manner other than an assignment authorization under s.95 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) or a subletting authorized under s.97 of
the




 
Act. Although
Mr. Adnan no longer resides
in the renal unit, he continues to pay the rent.
 
5.     The Landlord acknowledges s.104(4) of the Act which
considers the occupant of the rental unit to be deemed an assignment of the renal unit as the Landlord
failed to apply to
the Board under s.100 for an ordering evicting Mr. Arsenault within 60 days of
the Landlord discovering the unauthorized occupancy. The Landlord therefore acknowledges Mr. Arsenault as the named Tenant.
 
6.     Both the N5 notice and the L2 application identify
both Tenants as the Landlord expressed confusion over the history
of Tenancy. It was the uncontested evidence of the Landlord that Mr. Adnan no longer resides in the rental unit
but does pay the rent. The Landlord was not clear on the relationship between
the Tenants.
 
7.     Based on the information before
me, I find that both Tenants are party to this application.
 
8.     The Landlord’s application was
preceded by a single N5 notice of termination (“N5 Notice”) deemed
served on July 15, 2021. The N5 Notice set out the
reason for ending
the tenancy:
1) the Tenant’s behaviour or the behaviour of someone visiting or living with the
Tenant has substantially interfered with another
tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex, and/or lawful rights, privileges, or interests.
 
 
Substantial interference – Landlord’s Evidence
 
9.     I am satisfied that the conduct of
the Tenant has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex
for the reasons that follow.
 
10.  In the N5 notice, the Landlord alleges that the Tenant
on multiple occasions denied access to the Landlord’s real estate agent for the purpose of preparation for sale of the
property.
 
11. 
Schedule A attached to the N5 notice detailed
occurrences that fall beyond
the time limitation for the
purpose of the application. (CONFIRM WITH KAT).
 
12. 
In the matter
before me, the events from July 27, 2020 to July 26, 2021 will form the basis
of my analysis.
 
13.  It
was the testimony and evidence of the Landlord that on or about September 4, 2020, he retained
the services of a real estate agent to prepare the property for sale.
 
14.  The Tenant was notified by the Landlord in writing on
September 10, 2020 of the Landlord’s intention and provided the Tenant with the contact
information for the agent. At the same time, the Landlord advised the
Tenant that on September 16, 2020 the agent would be at the unit for the
purpose of taking photos to proceed with listing the property.




 
15. 
The Landlord
submitted into evidence
substantial email correspondence, the listing agreement
and police report.
 
16. 
It was the testimony
and evidence of the Landlord
that the Tenant
repeatedly refused entry to
the agent and Landlord despite being served valid notices of entry.
 
17.  The Landlord further
testified and provided
evidence that the Tenant became threatening
and abusive toward the Landlord and his agent. The Tenant made it so difficult
for the Landlord to sell the property that on our about September 15, 2020,
after receiving a threatening email from the Tenant, the real estate agent
informed the Landlord that he could not longer represent the Landlord as the
Tenant refused access to the rental unit and had threatened legal action
against the agent.
 
18.  It was the testimony of the Landlord
that when he attempted to prepare the unit for sale
again in April of 2021, he and his agent were denied entry by the Tenant after
having served proper notice. Police
accompanied the Landlord and agent and
yet the Tenant refused entry.
 
19.  On or about April 27, 2021, the Tenant sent a
threatening email to the Landlord’s employer
accusing him of “running and illegal rental business from their establishment”. The Landlord testified
that he was extremely embarrassed as he had been a good employee for 30 years.
 
20.  The Landlord testified
that he will be 81 in January
2022 and his needs to prepare for his
retirement. The rental unit will
provide the necessary income for him to retire and live comfortably. The
Tenant’s erratic and abusive behaviour has made him feel unsafe.
 
 
Substantial interference – Analysis
 
21.  Based on the evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant
has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex. The behaviour of
the Tenant has continued unabated for several years. The Tenant’s refusal to allow entry to the Landlord or his agents
has prevented the Landlord
with preparation for his retirement. This along with the aggressive and
inappropriate behaviour of the Tenant has negatively impacted the Landlord’s
health and well being and right to feel safe.
 
22.  Subsection 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”) states that a tenant can void an N5 Notice by stopping
the activities or correcting the described behaviour within seven days of being served with notice.
In this case, the seven-day
voiding period begins on July
16, 2021 and ends on July 22, 2021.
 
23.  I find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice. On
July 21, 2021 the Tenant sent a threatening
email to the Landlord and his representative denying the Landlord
access to the rental unit. The
Tenant has continued his threatening and inappropriate behaviour.




 
24.  The
Landlord testified that the Tenant
lives alone and although has referenced PTSD,
he is not aware of any details nor evidence to support the Tenant’s
claim.
 
25.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
26. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,009.22 (less
any amounts already paid to the Landlord), which represents compensation for the use of the unit from August
11, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from March 1, 2022 to the
date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
which represents application filing fee.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 28, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
