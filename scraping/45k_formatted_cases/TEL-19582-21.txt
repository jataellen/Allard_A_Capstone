Rong Wei Yu, attended the hearing. As of 10:34 a.m. the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although

by the Board.

were required to pay for the period from July 15, 2021 to November 14, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 8, 2021.

vacated the rental
unit on November 12, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,000.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 29, 2018 to
December 31 ,2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of November

possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
