Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-01476-17










 

K.C.L
and L.F.Y.A (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict R.K.J (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 24, 2017. Only the Landlords and the
Landlords’ representative, C.P.S.C, attended the hearing.
 
The
Landlord’s application is amended to remove K.S as a sub-tenant.
            
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2017 to July 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 20, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
3.      The
monthly rent as of the date of hearing is $1,525.00.
4.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,525.00 from the Tenant and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 29, 2016 to
May 20, 2017.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before August 8, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,918.84*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 28, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $50.14 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting July 29, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
August 8, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from August 9, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before August 8, 2017, then starting August 9,
2017, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 9,
2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,750.00 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2017, or
ii)       $5,275.00 if the payment is made on or before August 8, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 9, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
