            Order
under Section 69
 
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-09828-18



 


 


 



 
 
SEIL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict PS and
DF (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on December 3, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative CL attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,498.24 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 1, 2018
to December 10, 2018.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act in relation to the rent arrears.
 
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act in relation to the persistent late payment of rent.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before December 21, 2018.
 
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $295.46*.
 
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants:
$49.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 11,
2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before December 21, 2018, then starting December
22, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 22,
2018.
 
7.      If,
on or before December 21, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,408.20** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. 
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could
remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after December 22, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
9.      If
the Tenants void the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
7 or 8, the following provisions will apply:
 
a)    From
January 2019 to and including December 2019 the Tenants shall pay the monthly rent
to the Landlord on or before the first business day of the month for which the
rent becomes due.
b)    If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
9a) of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants.
