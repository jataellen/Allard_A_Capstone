Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


B, 7 TRIPP AVENUE BELLEVILLE ON K8P4N6


 




Between:


5019028 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joseph Whiteman


Tenant



 
 
 
On November 12, 2021, 5019028 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Joseph Whiteman (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered
into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
November 30, 2021.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.

3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

by January 16, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 18, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
