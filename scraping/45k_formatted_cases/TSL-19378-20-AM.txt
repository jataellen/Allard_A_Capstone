Tenant



 
 
This
order is amended
to correct a clerical error.
The amendments are bolded and underlined for ease of reference.
 
Gradimirka Velimirovic (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyrone Duncan (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
and to pay compensation for the money the Tenant should have paid had the
Tenant not misrepresented the Tenant's income or the income of a member of the
Tenant's family
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 30, 2021 at 9:00 a.m.
 
Only the Landlord, represented by Jimmy Gangadin, a licensed Paralegal, attended the hearing. The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
though being properly
served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing
proceeded without the Tenants at 11:32 a.m.
 
The Tenant,
Tyrone Duncan did not appear until 2:32 p.m. well after the hearing was held.
He stated that he had been present all the time, however as the Member taking attendance both at the onset of
the hearing at 9:00 a.m. and again prior to the hearing itself I noted that
that the Tenants were not present. After the Tenant appeared, despite claiming
to be present at the hearing, he inquired as to the outcome.
For the L2 portion
of the Application:
 
Determinations:




 
1.    
At the onset of the hearing the
Landlord’s representative sought to withdraw the L2 application, Application to
End a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant pertaining to the N5 Notice to End your
Tenancy For Interfering with Others, Damage or Overcrowding and the N6 Notice to End your Tenancy For Illegal Acts or Misrepresenting Income in a Rent-Geared-
to-Income Rental Unit.
 
2.     The Board consented to the request to withdraw the application
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The L2 portion of the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
 
For the L1 portion of the Application:
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.   
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 19, 2020.
 
2.   
The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,250.00
 
4.     The Landlord does not possess
a last month’s rent deposit.
 
5.    
As of the hearing
date the Landlord
was claiming a total of $40,181.00 which exceeds the Landlord and Tenant’s Board maximum
monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. Any amount over the amount of $35,000 will
not be included in this order. The Landlord’s legal representative acknowledged
this fact at the hearing.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant did not attend the
hearing to present evidence or submissions in support of granting relief from eviction
and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the
Board file.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
December 19, 2021.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*( the Landlord
and Tenant’s Board maximum monetary jurisdiction)
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December 8,
2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before December 19, 2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from December 20,
2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before December 19,
2021, then starting December 20, 2021, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after December 20, 2021.
 
7.     If, on or before December 19, 2021, the Tenant pays
the amount of $41,446.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after December 20, 2021 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
December 8, 2021
