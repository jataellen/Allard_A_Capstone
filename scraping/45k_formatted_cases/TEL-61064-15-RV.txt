Review Order
 
 
D.J. and D.B. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict W.C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.  The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date. This is the L2 application.

 
The Landlord(s) also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant(s) because the Tenant(s) did not pay the rent
that the Tenant(s) owe(s). This is the L1 application.
 
These applications were resolved by order TEL-61064-15
issued on May 28, 2019. 
 
On June 27, 2019, the Landlord requested
a review of the order.
 
The request was heard in Peterborough
on September 12, 2019 where the Landlord’s request to review was granted and a new
hearing was held on December 5, 2019. 
 
Only the first-named Landlord and her
son, V.J., attended the hearings on September 12, 2019 and December 5, 2019. 
 
 
Determinations:
BACKGROUND
1.   
The parties have appeared before
the Board frequently on this file. There has been a total of eight hearings with
respect to these applications prior to the order being issued on May 28, 2019. 
2.   
The length of the LTB proceeding
was due in part to the fact that the parties were also involved in litigation at
the Superior Court wherein the Tenant claimed that she owned the property. In June
2018, the Court rendered a decision in favour of the Landlords. 
REQUEST TO REVIEW
3.   
The Landlord’s L2 application
is based on a N5 notice of termination served to the Tenant on June 10, 2015 via
mail with a termination date of July 6, 2015. It alleged the following: 
a.   
The Tenant has an unauthorized
livestock farm at the property;
b.   
The Tenant is occupying areas
of the property that she is not authorized to by the Landlord; 
c.   
The Tenant is illegally parking
her vehicle; 
d.   
The Tenant is running an illegal
business of a livestock farm; and 
e.   
The Tenant is refusing access
to the property for inspections. 
4.   
The L2 application was dismissed
by the Board order TEL-61064-15 for the following reason:
8. With respect to the Landlords’ L2 application, as there was a challenge to the ownership of
this property and as the items noted on the N5 notice were things that would
have happened if someone believed that they owed [sic] the property, I have
dismissed this N5 in its entirety.
5.   
The Landlord believes the order
contains a serious error; specifically, the Member dismissed the Landlord’s L2 application
due to the Tenant ’s claim of ownership of property issue, when the Superior Court
dismissed the Tenant ’s claim as a beneficial owner. The Landlord goes on to say
they proved the Tenant never believed she owned the property but was trying to steal
it and lists their arguments for this. 
6.   
While the Landlord’s basis for
the review are not clearly articulated, the Landlord is correct in their submission
that the order contains a serious error. 
7.   
I find that the Member made a
serious error in finding that the N5 notice was defective simply because the Tenant
believed that she owned the rental unit. Whether or not the Tenant believed she
owned the rental unit didn’t change the fact that the alleged conduct occurred.

8.   
A finding that the N5 is defective
based on Tenant’s mistaken belief that she was the owner is akin to dismissing an
application for arrears because a tenant mistakenly believed they paid the rent
for a particular month. 
9.   
The Tenant’s mistaken belief
that she was the owner should have instead been considered as a ground for relief
under section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). 
10. Thus, I am satisfied that the order TEL-61064-15
issued on May 28, 2019 contains a serious error and the Landlord’s request to review
this order is granted. A new hearing was therefore held to consider the Landlord’s
application.     
L1 APPLICATION 
11. The Landlord’s L1 application has already been resolved
by order TEL-61064-15-VO-2 issued on July 5, 2019 confirming the Tenant paid all
the rent arrears she owed to the Landlord for the period ending June 30, 2019. 
L2 APPLICATION
12. The N5 notice of termination was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Act. Subsection 64(3) of the Act states:  
(3)  The
notice of termination under this section is void if the tenant, within seven
days after receiving the notice, complies with the requirement referred to in
clause (2) (c) or makes arrangements satisfactory to the landlord to comply
with that requirement.
13. Thus, the Tenant had seven days to remedy the situation
by refraining from the behaviour being complained of in the N5 and restoring the
residential premises to its original state. As the N5 notice of termination was
mailed and deemed served on June 15, 2015, the voiding period was June 16, 2015
– June 22, 2015.
14. The Landlord’s uncontested evidence was the first-named
Landlord managed the property between 1979-2003 and the second-named Landlord managed
the property from 2003 until November 20, 2019. The Landlords are partners. From
November 20, 2019 onwards, the first-named Landlord’s son managed the rental property.

15. As of the date of the hearing on September 12, 2019,
the second-named Landlord was out of the country in Arizona and not available to
testify. I granted an adjournment to allow the Landlord to obtain evidence with
respect to the voiding period and whether the N5 notice of termination had been
voided by the Tenant. I made it very clear to the Landlord and her son that I required
evidence about the Tenant’s conduct during the voiding period.
16. At the next hearing on December 5, 2019, the second-named
Landlord did not attend the hearing to testify nor did he provide any affidavit
evidence. 
17. The Landlord provided a receipt dated November 28,
2015 that was given to the Landlord by the Tenant for a permit for pot belly pigs
on the rental property. The Landlord states that the receipt is fake but that it
is the only document they have from 2015 confirming the operation of a livestock
farm. 
18. The Landlord’s evidence, the receipt dated November
28, 2015, is insufficient to establish that the Tenant carried on any of the activities
listed in the N5 notice during the period June 16 – 22, 2015. Alleged conduct by
the Tenant that occurs after the voiding period may be give rise to the Landlord’s
right to file another (non-voidable) N5 notice under section 68 of the Act (provided
that it is within six months from the service of the first N5) but is not relevant
here as the Landlord did not serve a second N5 notice.
19. I find that the evidence is insufficient to establish
that the Tenant continued to engage in the conduct listed N5 notice of termination
during the voiding period. Therefore, I must find that the Tenant voided the N5
notice in accordance with section 64(3) of the Act. As the N5 notice of termination
was voided, the Landlord’s L2 application for eviction must be dismissed. 
20. This order contains all of the reasons for my
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
1.     
The request to review order
TEL-61064-15 issued on May 28, 2019 is granted. 
2.     
The Landlord’s L2 application
is dismissed.
