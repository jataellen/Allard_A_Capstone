Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-40270-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 293 WELLINGTON STREET W SAULT
  STE. MARIE ON P6A1H8


 




Between:


Susan Or Murray Raisanen


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hannah Harvey


Tenant



 
 
 
Susan Or Murray Raisanen
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Hannah Harvey (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 8, 2020
and January 13, 2022. Only the
Landlord, S. Raisanen, attended the hearing.
It is determined that:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid $6,010.00 of the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.    
The Tenant also owes the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount
owing is $6,1750.00 ($6,010.00 + $175.00).
 
4.     The monthly rent is
$650.00.
 
5.     The Landlord said that the Tenant has been making
steady payments of $700.00 per month, and she requests that the Tenant continue to make $50.00 payments each month
towards the arrears.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
above in accordance with subsection 83(2) and 83(6) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
