Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12870-22



In the matter
of:


2702, 161 ROEHAMPTON AVENUE TORONTO ON M4P0C8


 




Between:


Apurba Bhowmik


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jasmine S. Greco


Tenant



 
 
Apurba Bhowmik (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jasmine
S. Greco (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on February 16, 2022. Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative, C. Nastas attended
the hearing. As of 1:40 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord alleged that the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of January 1, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental unit by the termination date set out in the agreement.
 
2.     The agreement titled
ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITY
AND 2 MONTHS NOTICE (TENANTS)
dated November
1, 2021, shows it was signed by both the Landlord and the Tenant. However, the
form is not one approved by the Board pursuant to section 43 (1) of the
Residential tenancies Act, 2006 which provides that where this Act permits a
landlord or tenant to give a notice
of termination, the notice
shall be in a form approved
by the Board. This is especially important
as the agreement does not contain information from the Board advising the Tenant on the
consequences of signing a notice of termination.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
