Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02773-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


#1, 57 DUNEDIN STREET ORILLIA ON L3V5T4


 




Between:


Christopher Arsenault


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Korbin Clark


Tenant



 
 
 
Christopher Arsenault (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Korbin Clark
(the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 27, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant
was represented by his paralegal Ciarra McMillen
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is
based on a Notice of Termination (‘N12’) in which the Landlord seeks
residential occupancy of the unit. The N12 was served
on the Tenants July 31, 2021, seeking termination of the tenancy
September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equivalent
to one month’s rent, in accordance with s. 48.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act), by an e-mail
transfer sent September 24, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord provided the Board with an affidavit
declaring he intends to reside in the rental
unit for at least one year. For the reasons
the follow I find the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purposes of residential occupation.
 
Preliminary Issue
 
4.     The Landlord’s witness worked for the Law Society of
Ontario as an auditor. In her professional capacity she audited my legal
practice. The audit has long since concluded and I have had no further
dealings with the Landlord’s witness
since. I notified
the parties




 
of this fact and took submissions
regarding whether I should recuse myself from this matter. Neither party took
issue. Having considered the matter, I was satisfied that a reasonable person
apprised of the circumstances here would not conclude that I could not adjudicate this matter fairly
and impartially. Accordingly, I found it was appropriate for me to hear the matter and proceeded to do so.
 
Landlord’s Position
 
5.    
In addition to the rental unit the
Landlord owned his primary residence with his mother, Anna Preston.
Ms. Preston testified she did not actually reside
in primary residence. Her name was on title to help her son obtain financing.
 
6.    
The Landlord secured new employment on a cruise
ship. He would
be traveling for long
periods of time work. Consequently, the primary residence was sold. This leads
the Landlord to require the rental unit for the purposes of residential occupation.
 
7.     The rental unit is a duplex. There is an upstairs and downstairs unit. The Tenant lives
downstairs. There is a female tenant
in the unit upstairs.
 
8.     The Landlord
needs a place to go while he waits for result of this hearing.
The upstairs unit has two
bedrooms. The Landlord arranged with the tenant upstairs to stay in the vacant
bedroom until he obtains vacant possession of the downstairs unit.
 
Tenant’s Position
 
9.    
It is the Tenant’s position that
the Landlord is dating the tenant upstairs. The Tenant believes the Landlord is going to stay in the upstairs
unit with his girlfriend and re rent the
downstairs unit for higher rent.
 
Analysis
 
10.  I have considered the evidence presented by both
parties. While it is rather unusual for a landlord to stay with another tenant,
I accept the Landlord’s evidence that staying with the tenant upstairs is a temporary
arrangement until he can obtain vacant possession of the unit downstairs. I am
satisfied the Landlord, in good faith, needs possession of the rental unit for
the purposes of residential occupation.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with s.
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
April 30,2022 pursuant to s. 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,468.09, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from October 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from March 1, 2022, to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
April 30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from May 01, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
