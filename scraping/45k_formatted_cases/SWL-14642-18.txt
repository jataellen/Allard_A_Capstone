Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-14642-18











 
 
 

JA (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict MB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant:
     
i.       
because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and 
   
ii.       
because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2
application).
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on May 9, 2018. 
The LLD and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, IK, attended the hearing.  As
of 11:03 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
The Landlord called one witness, KR.
 
Determinations:
 
       L1 application –
Arrears of Rent
 
1.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
2.     
The monthly rent is $1,015.00. 

3.     
The Tenant paid $600.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 21, 2017 to March 7, 2018.
6.     
Section 59 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) sets out that a landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of their tenancy if the tenant fails to pay rent lawfully
owing under a tenancy agreement (N4 notice).  In this case, because the Tenant
was in arrears of rent, the Landlord served an N4 effective March 7, 2018.  I
accept the uncontested testimony and evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied
that the Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period
from February 20, 2018 to May 19, 2018.  
       L2 application –
Persistent Late Payment and Substantial Interference
 
     Tenant
has Persistently Paid Rent Late
7.     
The Tenant has been in
possession of the rental unit since August 2015.  At this time, the rental
period runs from the 20th day of one month to the 19th
day of the next month.  The tenancy is month-to-month and rent is due on the 20th
day of the month.
8.     
The Landlord submitted a
leger (Exhibit # 1) which outlines that the Tenant paid the rent late 13 times
in the past 15 months.  Rent payments ranged from a week late to over 30 days
late over this period.  
9.     
Section 58 of the Act sets
out that a landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy if
the tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and
payable (N8 notice).  The Landlord served the Tenant with an N8 notice on March
8, 2018 that was effective May 19, 2018. I accept the uncontested testimony and
evidence of the Landlord and am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that
the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. 
Tenant
has Substantially Interfered with the Landlord’s and other Residents’
Reasonable Enjoyment and with the Landlord’s Lawful Rights, Privileges or
Interests
Incidents Detailed in the First N5 Notice
 
10.  
A Notice to End the
Tenancy for Interfering with Others (Form N5) was served on the Tenant on December
1, 2017.  The notice alleges that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. 
The Landlord and the Landlord testified to the incidents outlined in the first
N5 Notice.
11.  
The Landlord testified that
on November 29, 2017, the resident who lives in the unit below the Tenant
contacted him to complain about sounds of stomping, dragging items and loud
noises for a two-hour period in the middle of the night.  The resident said her
boyfriend went up to the Tenant’s unit to ask the Tenant to keep the noise
down, but a guest of the Tenant who answered the door refused the request,
using foul language.  
12.  
The Landlord’s witness, who
is the downstairs neighbour of the Tenant, testified that on November 29, 2017,
she and her boyfriend were disturbed by loud music, arguing and the sounds of
heavy items being dropped on the floor starting around 10:00 p.m. and not
stopping until after 2:00 a.m.  At around 11:30 p.m. the Landlord's witness’
boyfriend went up to ask the Tenant to be quiet, and the Tenant’s boyfriend
swore at him.
 
Incidents Detailed in the Second N5 Notice 
 
13.  
The second Notice to End
the Tenancy for Interfering with Others (Form N5) was served on the Tenant
on February 21, 2018.  The notice alleges that the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.  The Landlord and the Landlord's witness testified to the
incidents outlined in the second N5 Notice.  
14.  
The Landlord testified that
after he served the Tenant with the first N5 notice, there were no new
complaints about the Tenant until February 19, 2018 when the resident who lives
in the unit below the Tenant contacted him to complain about music blasting at
such a volume that her unit walls were shaking, and about arguing, stomping and
yelling from midnight to about 4:00 a.m.
15.  
The Landlord's witness
testified that on February 18, 2018, there was loud music coming from the
Tenant’s unit all day, and at about 6:00 p.m., someone turned it up even
louder, such that the walls in the Landlord's witness’ unit were shaking.  The
Landlord's witness called municipal by-law enforcement, and a by-law officer
attended and warned the Tenant to turn down the music.  After that, the
Landlord's witness and her boyfriend were disturbed by continued noises of the
Tenant and others in her unit fighting and banging around throughout the
evening and into the early morning.
16.  
The Landlord's witness
described the impact of the ongoing late night noise coming from the Tenant’s
unit.  The Landlord's witness and her boyfriend routinely go to work in the
morning exhausted from lack of sleep, and the lack of sleep has also increased
the Landlord's witness’s anxiety.  The Landlord's witness described herself as
fearful of all the arguing and fighting that occurs in the Tenant’s unit.  The
Landlord's witness has two dogs who often start whimpering when the fighting
starts up in the Tenant’s unit, and the Landlord's witness has to take the dogs
out for a walk to calm them down and get them away from the noise.
17.  
In a separate allegation on
the second N5 notice, the Landlord claimed that the Tenant was late paying her
portion of the water bill.  The Landlord testified that the water bill is
shared among the residents, and each resident is responsible for paying their
portion, as per their tenancy agreements.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative
asserted that the Tenant’s failure to pay the water bill on time is a breach of
the tenancy agreement and interferes with the Landlord’s lawful rights as if
left unpaid, the municipality will add the unpaid amount to the Landlord’s
property tax bill.  
Analysis:
 
18.  
The first N5 notice was
served pursuant to section 64 the Act.  That section sets out that a landlord
can give a notice of termination if the conduct of the tenant is such that it
substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or
substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of
the landlord or another tenant.  That section also provides that the notice of
termination is voided if the tenant stops the offending conduct during the
seven days following the service of the notice; in this case between December 2
– 8, 2017.
19.  
The Landlord testified that
after the first N5 notice was served, he received no complaints about the
Tenant’s conduct.  This was supported by the testimony of the Landlord's
witness, who described incidents in late November 2017 and again in
mid-February 2018.   I am satisfied that the Tenant voided the first Form N5. 
20.  
The second N5 notice was
served pursuant to section 68 of the Act. That section entitles the Landlord to
serve a non-voidable N5 if the Tenant voided the first N5 and within the
following six months there is another incident.  As there is no ability to void
second N5 notices, the Landlord was entitled to file the application to evict
the Tenant on March 9, 2018.
21.  
I accept the uncontested
testimony of the Landlord and the Landlord's witness, and find that the Landlord
proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of
the residential complex by making undue noise in the residential complex late
at night, and interfered with the lawful rights of the Landlord by not paying
her water bill on time. 
Relief from Eviction:
 
22.  
Having found the Landlord has
proven the allegations in his applications, I will turn my mind to relief from
eviction, as required under section 83 of the Act.
23.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
24.  
The Landlord submitted an
email exchange between the Landlord’s Legal Representative and the Tenant, in
which the Tenant agrees to a conditional order terminating the tenancy on a
non-voidable basis on September 19, 2018, provided the Tenant repay the arrears
in a payment plan set out in the email, pays her ongoing rent on time, and does
not repeat any of the behaviours listed in the N5 notices (Exhibit # 2).  The
Landlord’s Legal Representative stated that the Landlord wanted to pursue an
order with these terms, with the consent of the Tenant.
25.  
As the Tenant was not
present to testify, I cannot simply order these terms on consent of both
parties.  However, since the Landlord proved his allegations about non-payment
of rent, persistent late payment of rent, and substantial interference with the
reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord and other residents at the residential complex,
the Landlord is entitled to seek an order for repayment of the arrears and a
non-voidable termination of the tenancy effective 11 days from the date of this
order.  The Landlord’s proposed plan allows for a significant delay in the
eviction date, provided the Tenant makes the payments as set out below and
abides by the conduct conditions.  I find there is no prejudice to the Tenant
in imposing the Landlord’s proposed plan, as it allows the Tenant more time to
repay the arrears and secure new accommodations. 
26.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for this matter, and no other reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. 
2.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 19, 2018, then starting September 20, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
3.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after September 20, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,635.00,
which represents the arrears of rent ($2,445.00), and costs ($190.00)
outstanding for the period ending May 19, 2018.
5.     
The Tenant shall make the following payments to
the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 4 of this order
(a)  The
Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 4 of this order:



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




June 2, 2018


$1,000.00
(costs
  and arrears)




July 2, 2018


$1,000.00
(arrears)




August 2, 2018


$635.00
(arrears)



 
(b)  The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of June 2018 to
August 2018 in full, and on the 20th of each corresponding month. 
The Landlord shall apply the last month's rent deposit to the rental period
from August 20, 2018 – September 19, 2018.   
6.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraph 5, and by the dates required, then:
(a)     
The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant prior to September 19, 2018, and for
the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered
under paragraph 4 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within
30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 5 of this order. 
(b)     
The balance owing under paragraph 4 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.
7.     
If for the remainder of the
tenancy the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant permits in the residential complex engages in the type of behaviour cited in either of the Landlord’s N5
Notices (effective December 22, 2017 and March 7, 2018), which includes but is
not limited to excessive noise coming from the rental unit and late payment of
the Tenant’s share of the water bill; the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant
prior to September
19, 2018.  The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of
a condition.
