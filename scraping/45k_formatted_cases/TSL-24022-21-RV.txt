Review Order
 
Hazelview Property
Services Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jarrod Terrell (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-24022-21 issued on January
11, 2022.
 
On August
26, 2022, the Tenant requested
a review of the order and that the order be stayed until
the request to review the order is resolved. The Tenant alleged
that they were not reasonably able to participate in the proceeding and that the order
contains a serious error because there was no tenancy.
 
On August 29,
2022, interim order TSL-24022-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
January 11, 2022.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on September 29, 2022. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, N. Mizzi, the Tenant's Legal Representative, C. Yehia and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
The parties
mutually agreed to resolve all matters at issue in the application and requested an order
on consent. I was satisfied that the parties understood the consequences of the
joint submission.
 
On consent of the parties,
it is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review order
TSL-24022-21 issued on January 11, 2022, is granted. The order cannot be
enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.     The interim order issued
on August 29, 2022, is cancelled, and replaced with this order.
