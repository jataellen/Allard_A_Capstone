Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12220-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


7, 67 JOHN PERKINS BULL
DRIVE TORONTO ON M3K0B4


 




Between:


2565462 Ontario
Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Akeela Alizah
  Hoosain


Tenant



 
 
 
2565462 Ontario Limited (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Akeela Alizah Hoosain (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Faith McGregor attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Tenant has not paid rent since July 2021 and currently
owes the Landlord
$7,412.10.
 
3.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,395.91 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
November 30, 2021
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
1, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.




File Number: HOL-12220-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $989.10,
which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from December 1, 2021 to
January 21, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $45.89 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 22, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 1, 2022, then starting
February 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
