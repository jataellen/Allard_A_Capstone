Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24618-21



In the matter
of:


93 EDINBURGH ROAD S.
  GUELPH ON N1H5P5


 




Between:


Patricia Gomez-Silva


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Brandelynn Davis


 
Tenant



 
 
Patricia Gomez-Silva (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Brandelynn Davis (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on December
14, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Angie Gravelle,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. The matter was called
at 11:05 a.m. and it was noted that the Tenant had disconnected from the video conference. There was no indication that the Tenant
was having technical difficulties.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 15,
2021 to December 14, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 9,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,600.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,600.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from
November 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant,




File Number: SOL-24618-21
 
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $8,701.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $85.48 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January 17, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$12,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 14, 2022, or
ii)             
$14,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 16, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 17, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
