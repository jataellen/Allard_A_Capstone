FF
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AM and
GM (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe (L1 Application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage, and because the Tenants,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and
because the Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date (L2 Application).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on May 15, 2019. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application – Arrears
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 20, 2019.
2.      The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,344.00
4.     
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 1, 2010
to February 20, 2019.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application
Interference
with Reasonable Enjoyment
8.      The
Landlord served the Tenants with an N5 notice of termination (‘N5 notice’) by
mail on January 14, 2019. Service was effective five days later, on January 19,
2019. The grounds for eviction in the notice are substantial interference with
reasonable enjoyment. The termination date in the N5 notice is January 31,
2019.
9.      A
first N5 notice for termination for substantial interference must be served at
least 20 days before the termination date in the notice. In this case, the N5
notice was served only 12 days before the termination date. Because the N5
notice was short-served, it is invalid. The tenancy cannot be terminated on the
basis of this N5 notice.
Demolishing
the rental unit
10.   The
Landlord served the Tenants with an N13 notice of termination (‘N13 notice’) on
January 14, 2019 by mail. Service was effective five days later, on January 19,
2019. The grounds for eviction in the N13 notice are that the Landlord intends
to demolish the rental unit. The termination date in the N13 notice is May 31,
2019. 
11.   At
the hearing the Landlord testified that he intends to demolish the rental unit,
which is a house, and then build two houses on the land once occupied by the
rental unit. The Landlord has taken most of the steps necessary to obtain a
building/demolition permit for this work. At the hearing the Landlord submitted
a letter and attached documents from the City of Toronto’s Committee of
Adjustment showing that there is an outstanding issue with respect to a tree
that must be removed for the work to proceed. These documents show that the
Landlord’s application has been accepted pending the Landlord’s compliance with
a condition. The Landlord testified that he intends to comply with this one
condition within the next few weeks. It is clear from these documents that once
the condition is met, the Landlord will have the permits that he needs to
demolish the rental unit and build the new houses. 
12.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated in
order to demolish it and that the Landlord has taken all
reasonable steps to obtain the necessary permits for this work.
 
Damage
claim
 
13.   In
his application the Landlord claims compensation for undue damage to the rental
unit. At the hearing the Landlord withdrew this claim. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding
the L1 application:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before June 2, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,005.54*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 22, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $44.19 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 23, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 2,
2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 3, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 2, 2019, then starting June 3, 2019,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 3, 2019.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void the rent arrears portion of this order and continue
the tenancy to June 2, 2019 (when the tenancy is terminated because the
Landlord wishes to demolish the unit) the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust:
i)        $7,054.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2019, or
ii)       $8,398.00 if the payment is made on or before June 2, 2019**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside the rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after June 3, 2019 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
Regarding
the L2 application:
10.   The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of June 2, 2019.
The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 2, 2019.
 
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 2, 2019, then starting June 3, 2019,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after June 3, 2019.
 
13.   The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $44.19 per day for compensation for the use
of the unit from June 3, 2019 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
14.   If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before June 2,
2019, they will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from June 3, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
