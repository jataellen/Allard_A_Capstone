Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Velauthapillai Sugunan


Tenant



 
 
 
Amaz Property
Managemant (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Velauthapillai Sugunan (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Velauthapillai Sugunan (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference July 20, 2021 at 9:00 a.m.
 
Only the Landlord, represented by Brian Rubin, a licensed Paralegal, attended the hearing.
The Tenant, Velauthapillai
Sugunan was not present or represented at the hearing though being properly
served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing
proceeded without the Tenants at 11:39 a.m.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
L1 application
 
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 30, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit when the application was
filed.




 
 
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$2,100.00
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant has not made any payments since the application was filed.
 
7.    
As of the hearing date,
the Tenant owed the Landlord $22,900.68 including arrears of rent to July 31, 2021 of $22699.68 and the application fee of $201.00.
Since the hearing, another six rental periods have
begun, and six more month’s rent have become due. Therefore, the amount in this
order includes August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021,
December 2021 and January 2022’s rent. If the Tenant has paid the Landlord
August 2021, September 2021, October
2021, November 2021, December 2021 and January 2022’s rent, and /or made any
payments to the Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those
payments from the amount owing in this order.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
Tenant did not attend the hearing to present evidence
or submissions in support of granting relief from eviction
and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the
Board file.
 
 
L2 application
 
 
9.    
The Landlord’s representative submitted
 
a)    
The rent is
due on the first of
each month.
 
b)    
The Tenant
has paid the rent late 5 times for each of the past 5 months; the rent for
 
I.       
May 2020 was paid May 11, 2020
II.        
June 2020 was paid June 10 and June 17, 2020
III.       
July 2020 was paid July 7, July 15 and July 20, 2020
IV.       
August 2020 was paid August 6, August 18, August 25, 2020
V.       
September 2020 was paid September 14 and September 15, 2020
 
10. 
Based on the information submitted I am of the opinion that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent when it is due and payable.
 
It is ordered that:




 
 
 
L1 application
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$31,473.02*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
As of the hearing date
the Landlord was claiming a total of $22,900.68 which is approaching the Landlord and Tenant’s Board
maximum monetary jurisdiction of
$35,000.00. Any amount over the amount
of $35,000 will not be included in this order.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $69.04
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
9.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $35,500.68** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
