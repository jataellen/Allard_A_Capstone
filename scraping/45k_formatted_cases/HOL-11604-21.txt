140 Main St Holdings Inc c/o Quadreal Residential
Properties G.P. Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Holly Russell and UJ Properties (the 'Tenants') because they
or another occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have
carried out, or permitted someone to
carry out an illegal trade, business
or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex involving the production of an
illegal drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the possession of an
illegal drug for the purposes of trafficking; because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the residential complex
have seriously impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 27, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Vanessa Sullivan (‘VS’), the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Martin Zarnett, and the Landlord’s
witness, Detective Constable Chad Macavelia (‘DCCM’), attended the hearing. As of 10 a.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On
June 2, 2021, DCCM attended the rental unit and executed a “controlled drugs
and substances” search warrant. The police also executed a search warrant on a
different rental unit in the same residential complex that was also being
rented by the Tenant, Holly Russel
(unit 2502).




 
2.    
According
to DCCM, the Tenants were operating an illegal cannabis dispensary in the
residential complex. Upon entering the rental unit that is the subject of this
application, it did not look like it was used for a residential purpose.
Rather, it seems that the Tenants were using the rental unit as a staging area
for drivers of their illegal cannabis dispensary.
The police found and seized large quantities of cannabis from unit 2502.
 
3.    
The
Tenant, Holly Russel, was arrested and charged with offences under the Cannabis
Act and Controlled Drugs and Substances Act including possession and
possession for the purpose of trafficking. The police also seized the rental
unit pursuant to the Cannabis Act.
 
4.    
Based on the evidence
before me, I am satisfied that the Tenants
committed an illegal
act in the residential complex that affects the nature of the complex.
The tenancy will be terminated on this basis.
 
5.    
I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify
refusing or delaying eviction.
 
6.    
As the
tenancy is terminated, there is no need to make findings regarding whether the
Tenants seriously impaired the safety of another person.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of January 12,
2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 12,
2022.
 
2.    
The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $60.82 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit from January 8, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the
Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 12,
2022, they will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the
unit is not vacated on or before January 12, 2022, then starting January 13,
2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
6.    
Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 13,
2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
