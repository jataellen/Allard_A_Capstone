Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-26031-22
 



In the matter
of:


921, 550 JARVIS
STREET TORONTO ON M4Y2H9


 




Between:


Park Property Management Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Bryan Lico


Tenant



 
On January 14, 2022, Park
Property Management Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bryan Lico (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
December 22, 2021 with respect to application TSL-23793-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$640.80 on or before January
10, 2022 towards costs and
arrears. The Tenant paid $3.16.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,922.40 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-23793-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,919.24 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order TSL-23793-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,336.84 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: TSL-26031-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TSL-23793-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$581.05*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $43.95
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February 11, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.

The tenant has until February 10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 12, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
