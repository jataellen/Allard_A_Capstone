In the matter
of:


805, 1541 LYCEE PLACE OTTAWA ON K1G4E2


 




Between:


1213763/1319399 Ontario Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Stella Odagwe


Tenant



 
 
 
1213763/1319399 Ontario
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stella Odagwe (the 'Tenant') The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, David Lyman and the Tenant
attended the hearing. Christina DaCosta attended as
witness for the Landlord.
 
The application is amended
and GWL Realty Advisors Residential is removed from the style of
cause of this order as they are not the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord filed the application on October 18, 2021 two days before
the second N5 Notice was deemed received on
October 20, 2022 having been mailed on October 15, 2021.
 
2.     Pursuant to section 191(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), a notice
is “deemed validly
given if it is proven
that its contents
actually came to the
attention of the person from whom it was intended within the required time period”.
 
3.     Section 191(3) of the Act also
states a notice given by a mail shall be deemed to have been given on the fifth day after
mailing.
 
4.    
Section 69 of the Residential Tenancies Act states, A landlord may apply to the
Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant if the
landlord has given notice to terminate the tenancy under this Act…




File Number: EAL-98200-21
 
5.    
The Landlord states the date they filed the application is irrelevant as the second N5 Notice is a non-voidable Notice
and makes no difference if the application was filed before the second N5 was
given. If I accept this argument then all applications can be filed before a
valid Notice is given to a tenant and that reasoning conflicts with the
principle of procedural fairness.
 
6.    
I
find the Landlord
filed the L2 application two days before
the second N5 Notice was
given, and since the application was filed
early, the Landlord cannot not file
under section 69 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
