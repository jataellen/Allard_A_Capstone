Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07118-18



 


 


 



 
 
GT and GT (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict RA (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on September 4,
2018.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’
legal representative, DS, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlords are seeking a
standard termination order.  The Landlords’ legal representative (DS) submitted
that the Landlords are not corporate landlords with substantial means to
sustain one tenancy.  He said the arrears are currently substantial, and the
Landlords are being severely prejudiced by effectively subsidizing the Tenant
to live in their rental unit.  DS further submitted that the Tenant has not
demonstrated the means or ability to pay the rent for five months, nor has he
made any good faith payments towards the rent.
 
3.     
The Tenant has lived in the
rental unit, a house, with his wife and son, since November 2016.  He said the
Landlords could have cashed his post dated cheques until the end of June, 2018,
and if they had done so the arrears would not have been as high as they are
currently.  The Tenant said that his financial situation changed at the
beginning of July, 2018, when he returned from working on an overseas
contract.  At that time, he said, he was owed a substantial amount of money
that has not yet been paid.  The overseas company that owes him $100,000.00 has
been going through a financial crisis, and, he said, they have committed to
paying him the full contractual amount in October and November, 2018.
 
4.     
The Tenant proposed a
payment plan in which he would pay the full arrears and rent going forward on
or before December 1, 2018.  He said that he has been a good tenant, and has always
paid the rent on time until May 2018.  The Tenant said he has not been able to
make good faith payments because his family has been completely dependent on
their one son who is independent to pay for food and living costs.  The Tenant
said it is important for him and his family to continue the tenancy.  His wife
does not work outside the home and he is the sole support.  The Tenant said he
is also currently pursuing other contracts that could comfortably permit him to
meet his proposed payment plan.
 
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  In particular,
the Tenant has proposed a payment plan that he has no certainty he will be able
to meet.  The evidence demonstrates that he does not have the financial means
to support the tenancy at present, and there is no certain prospect that he
will be able to do so soon.  He has not made any payments at all towards the
rent in five months.  The arrears will be beyond the jurisdiction of the Board
by October 1, 2018, and the Landlords are therefore severely prejudiced by
having the Tenant remain in the rental unit.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before September
18, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$19,035.62*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
September 7, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $147.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
September 8, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before September 18, 2018, the
Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from September 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 18, 2018, then starting September 19, 2018, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after September 19, 2018.
 
8.     
If, on or before September
18, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $22,675.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after September 19, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
