Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-13782-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


212, 400 GRENFELL STREET OSHAWA ON L1J4W7


 




Between:


2791798 Ontario Inc.
Valliant Rental Properties Limited


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Florence
Gordon


Tenant



 
 
2791798 Ontario Inc. and Valliant
Rental Properties Limited
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order requiring Florence Gordon (the 'Tenant') to pay compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 26, 2021.
Only the Landlord Representative C. Aylwin attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords
terminated the employment of the Tenant on November 19, 2020 and the Tenant
vacated the superintendent's premises on May 7, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlords seek
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date. No rent was paid by the Tenant after the Landlord terminated her
employment and the Tenant did not pay a deposit.
 
3.    
I am satisfied that the
Tenant meets the definition of a superintendent for the premises. The Tenant
was hired as the Assistant Superintendent for the building and lived on-site.
The Tenant’s job description comprised of assisted building tenants with day-to-day
matters, posted notices in the building, and performing routine janitorial
duties.
 
4.    
Section 93(3) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) provides that a landlord shall not charge a
tenant rent or compensation or receive rent or compensation from a tenant with
respect to the one-week period after the employment of the tenant is
terminated. At the hearing, the
Landlords advised they would be willing to waive rent for the balance of
November 2020 in satisfaction of the rent-free requirement under section 93(3)
of the Act.
