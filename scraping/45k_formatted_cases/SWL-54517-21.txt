Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021

The monthly
rent is $1,461.50.

and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
The
only amount outstanding is $183.00 as part of the Landlord's cost of filing the
application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs only and not
