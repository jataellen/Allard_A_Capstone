Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18094-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT 1, 25 GRANARD BOULEVARD SCARBOROUGH ON M1M2E2


 




Between:


Geetha Shankar


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kanav Mahendru


Tenant



 
 
 
Geetha Shankar (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kanav Mahendru (the 'Tenant') because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
18, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Kristen Netta, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant points
to issues with the wifi, parking, and a confrontation with the Landlord to establish the Landlord is
serving the notice in bad faith.
 
2.    
The rental unit is in the basement
of the Landlord’s 1,200 square foot bungalow.
The Landlord had three tenants living
in units in the basement.
One tenant moved out in May
when the Landlord informed that tenant that the Landlord wanted to stop having
tenants so their university student children who live with them could move into
the basement. The room that the
tenant who vacated has not been rented to any other tenants.
 
3.     The Landlord’s son, Adithya Shankar, testified that he
intends to move into the basement because he needs more space to do his studies
and complete his masters project for his bio-medical engineering degree. The project can not be completed in the space available
on the main floor. If he cannot
complete the project, he will be required to take two additional semesters of
studies, at $4,000.00 per semester, to receive his degree.
 
4.     The Landlord testified
that the tenants
were informed of their intentions in February 2021.
 
5.     I find the Tenant has not established, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Landlord
has served the notice in bad faith.




 
6.    
The Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
7.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $475.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 15, 2017 to September 14, 2021
 
9.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent on June 28, 2021.
 
10.  The Tenant has known about the Landlord’s intention
for nearly one year. I find, however, a delay in the termination of the tenancy
is appropriate to provide the Tenant
additional time to find alternative accommodations.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,589.86, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from September 15, 2021 to January 26, 2022, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. This amount is
offset by any rent the Tenant has paid during this period.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $15.62 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
