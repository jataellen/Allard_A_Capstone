Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97254-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1524 FISHER AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2C3J5


 




Between:


Minto Apartment Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jordan Tremblay


Tenant



 
 
 
Minto Apartment Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jordan Tremblay (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 23, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s representative, A. Skelly,
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,335.80 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to April 29, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $850.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
6.    
The Tenant has been struggling to
pay the rent. He received assistance
from the City of Ottawa in February 2021 and was denied further assistance in
November 2021. The Tenant’s payment proposal
is based on future events,
including his wife returning to work.
The Tenant was hesitant to make a firm commitment to a payment plan in
negotiations with the Landlord because he was not confident in his ability to
make the payments. The Tenant has resided in the unit for 7 years and the delay
is to give him time to plan to pay the arrears or move.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,715.23*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
February 1, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $45.28
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $11,231.38** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
