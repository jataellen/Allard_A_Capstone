Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-86130-17
 











 
 
 

C.L.P.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict E.A.(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on January 24,
2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, G.P.and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from October 7, 2017 to
January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 17, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 8, 2017 to November 17,
2017.
4.     
The Tenant paid $2,400.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
This matter was first
scheduled on December 13, 2017 and was adjourned on consent because both the
Landlord and the Tenant wanted to check their records.
6.     
An interim order was issued
on December 13, 2017 and the parties were advised that if a party does not
comply with the interim order, the member at the hearing may refuse to consider
the party’s evidence or submissions.
7.     
The Tenant did not comply
with the interim order. The Tenant was supposed to pay $1,350.00 to the
Landlord or into the Board on January 1, 2018. The Tenant only paid $1,200.00
to the Landlord on January 1, 2018 and testified that the Landlord refused to
accept the other $150.00, which I find hard to believe.
8.     
The Tenant’s argument is
that the Tenant was supposed to move into the rental unit October 7, 2017 but
because of the condition of the unit, the Tenant moved into the rental unit on
October 27, 2017 and should not be paying rent for that month.
9.     
The Landlord provided a copy
of the move in report which is signed by both the Landlord and the Tenant that
the unit was inspected on October 7, 2017 and the unit was in good condition.
Therefore I find that the tenancy started on October 7, 2017 and the Tenant
chose to move in on October 27, 2017 on the Tenant’s own decision. Therefore
the Tenant owed the Landlord for the month of October 2017 from October 7, 2017
to October 31, 2017. The Tenant’s argument not to pay rent for that period is
not valid.
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
5, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $738.60*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 25, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 26, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 5, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2018, then starting February 6, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 6, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before February 5,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,078.71** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 6, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
