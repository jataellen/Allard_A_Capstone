Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-14561-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 16 STEVENSGATE DRIVE AJAX ON L1T4Z3


 




Between:


Architkumar Shah
  Mitisha Mehta


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Marsha Mohamed


Tenant



 
 
 
Architkumar Shah and Mitisha
Mehta (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marsha
Mohamed (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
926 3019 7558# on October
26, 2021. The Landlords
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords purchased the home in May 2020. The home had three
rental units in the basement at the
time. The Landlords wanted vacant
possession and the former owner was to provide this to the Landlords. The Tenant signed an N11 agreement to
terminate the tenancy but through hearings
before the Board it was determined that the Tenant had
not agreed to terminate the tenancy. As
such, the Landlords served an N12 on January 17, 2021 with a termination date
of April 30, 2021, because they do not want and did not want to be landlords. Apart from this tenant, the other tenants
have vacated their rooms and the Landlords have made no effort to rent to any
new tenants.
 
2.    
I
find the Landlords’ in good faith,
want possession of the rental
unit for personal
use.
 
3.     The Tenant requested
a delay to terminating the tenancy. There termination date on the notice was some ten months ago but the
Landlords agreed to provide the Tenant with more time to vacate the unit.
 
4.     At the hearing,
the parties consented
to the following order.




File Number: TEL-14561-21

ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
