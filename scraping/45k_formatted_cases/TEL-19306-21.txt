possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.

7.       
I
find on a balance of probabilities, that the Landlord
in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupancy for a minimum
of twelve months.
 
8.       
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
17, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
If the Tenant does not vacate
the rental unit on or before February
28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, Tenant shall pay $27.95 daily compensation for each day he
remains in the rental unit.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
