Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54331-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 3 CUMMINGS AVENUE LONDON ON N6H1J6


 




Between:


Carol Ryan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Phillips


Tenant



 
 
 
Carol Ryan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daniel
Phillips (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on December 20, 2021. The
Landlord attended the hearing
and was represented by Timothy Mobberley, Paralegal. As of 10:30am the Tenant was not present, despite
receiving notice of hearing from the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is based on an N12 notice served to the Tenant on August 27, 2021 with a termination date of October
31, 2021. The Landlord’s N12 notice
asserts that the Landlord personally
requires possession of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord has filed an
affidavit pursuant to section 72(1)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(Act) certifying that she in good faith
requires the rental
unit for her own personal use.
 
3.     The Landlord has paid to the Tenant
compensation in the amount of $400.00
which is equal to one month's on
October 18, 2021, pursuant to section 48.1 of the Act.
 
4.     The Landlord testified that she is currently living
with her boyfriend and requires the rental
unit to be closer to her child who has recently had a baby and to provide
assistance for her grandchild. The
Landlord’s son, spouse and grandchild currently reside in the basement unit of
the home where the rental unit is located.
 
5.     The Landlord testified
that the Tenant in the upper unit is in the process
of vacating and advised the
Landlord that he has found a new rental unit for January 2022.




 
6.    
Based on the evidence before the
Board I am satisfied that the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for a period of at least one year. The Landlord’s testimony was credible and
consistent throughout the hearing.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of
the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant was not present
to dispute
the Landlord’s evidence
or seek relief
from eviction.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 14, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,249.25, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to February 3, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$13.15 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 4, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting
February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.
 
 
 
 
February 3, 2022

In accordance with section 81 of

located.
