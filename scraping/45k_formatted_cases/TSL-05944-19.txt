Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-05944-19










 

P
P (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N M (NM)
and R D (RD) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe (L1 Application).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants because the Tenants have been persistently late in paying their rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date (L2 application).
            
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on August 9, 2019 and on August 30,
2019.
 
The
Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative I. S, and the Tenants attended
the hearing on August 9, 2019. Only the Landlord’s representative, M L attended
the hearing. The Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Procedural history:
 

On August 9, 2019 the Tenants sought to raise issues
     under s.82 of the Act. The Tenants had not give the Landlords sufficient
     notice that they intended to raise these issues and, in any event, there
     was not enough time in the block to do a fulsome hearing of the Tenants’
     many issues. I adjourned the hearing and issued an interim order. At the
     hearing on August 9, 2019 I told the Tenants what the interim order would
     require of them and when. The interim order required the Tenants to make
     payments into the Board, the first of which was due on or before August
     20, 2019. As of August 30, 2019, the Board’s records do not show any
     payments into the Board by the Tenants.

 

The interim order provided that if the Tenants
     failed to comply with the order to make payments into the Board that the
     Landlord could request that the time to when this matter is heard be
     shortened. The Landlord made that request on August 21, 2019 and it was
     granted. The Landlord was ordered to serve the Tenants with the notice of
     hearing for the new hearing date of August 30, 2019.

 

At the hearing on August 30, 2019 the Landlord
     testified that he served the notice of hearing on the Tenants on August
     24, 2019. The Landlord further testified that shortly after he serve the
     notice of hearing, while he was still at the residential complex, the
     Tenant RD approached him and spoke with him about the notice of hearing,
     saying that the Tenants expected to receive it by mail. The Landlord told
     RD to call the Board if he had any questions. 

 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application – Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      The
Tenants were not present at the hearing to give submissions or evidence with
respect to their s.82 issues.
2.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from March 1, 2019 to August 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 23, 2019.
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 2, 2018 to
April 23, 2019.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application – Persistent Late Payment of Rent
6.      On March
22, 2019, the Landlord served the Tenants a Notice to Terminate at End of the
Term for persistent late payment of rent (the ‘N8 notice’) with a termination
date of June 30, 2019,
7.      If find
that the N8 notice is in compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
it meets the 60-day requirement, and it provides sufficient details as of the
reason for the notice
8.      On the
Landlord’s unopposed evidence, the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due, as specified on the notice.
9.      I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.        
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application – Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the rent arrears portion of this order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before September 14, 2019.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,185.38*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to September 3, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting September 4, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
September 14, 2019, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from September 15, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 14, 2019, then starting
September 15, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 15,
2019.
8.      If,
on or before September 14, 2019, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,990.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, the rent arrears portion of this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated,
and the Tenants could remain in the unit September 14, 2019 when the tenancy
will terminate for persistent late payment.  If this payment is not made in
full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside the rent arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after September 15, 2019 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
L2
Application – Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.   If
the Tenants void the L1 application for arrear of rent above, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is still terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before September 14, 2019.
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 14, 2019, then starting September
15, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after September 15,
2019.
