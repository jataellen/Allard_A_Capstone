Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25475-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


914, 121 HUNTER STREET
W HAMILTON ON L8P1R2


 




Between:


The Effort
Trust Company


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nicole Macaskill Sanchez Hankey


Tenants



 
 
 
The Effort Trust Company (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Nicole Macaskill and Sanchez Hankey (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants
owe. The Landlord
also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference
on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Kimberly
Holleran, attended the hearing. As of 2:47 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from July 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $100.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
4.     As of
January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit increased to $1,548.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 31, 2018 to
October 2, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $1,550.00 after
the application was filed.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,107.19*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by
or on behalf of the Tenants, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $50.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,952.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
