In the matter
of:


1106, 161
OAKWOOD AVENUE E TORONTO ON M6E2V2


 




Between:


1597180 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Gladys Mingo


Tenant



 
 
1597180 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy of Gladys
Mingo (the 'Tenant'), and for compensation for the use of the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October
12, 2021.
 
Eddie Neuberger, attended on behalf of the Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal Representative
Natasha Mizzi, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow, I find that the Tenant
did not transfer
the occupancy of the
rental unit to an unknown person, hereinafter called the 'Unauthorized Occupant') in a manner that was not
authorized by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.    
Eddie Neuberger (EN), testified on
behalf of the Landlord, that she is the property manager. Approximately August
6 or 8, 2020, she began receiving rent cheques from Lizette Escabar
(LE), the Tenant’s
daughter. In July 2021 she met with LE who confirmed
that she was living in the unit and her mother was living in Woodbridge.
 
3.     Prior to testifying, but after hearing
EN’s testimony, the Tenant requested
an adjournment because she did
not receive the hearing documents, her daughter just told her about today, and was not prepared to proceed today as she
just found out after the Landlord’s testimony what the issue was.
 
4.     After consulting with the Tenant, as she now
understood what was at issue, she agreed to give her testimony and be cross
examined, but her documentary evidence would be submitted via post-hearing submission; the Landlord’s Legal Representative emailed
the Tenant a copy of the application prior to the end of the hearing.
The Tenant’s post- hearing submissions were received, no submissions were
received from the Landlord or the Landlord’s Legal Representative.

5.     The Tenant testified that she never moved out of the unit; because of COVID-19 she had been staying
at her boyfriend’s, in Woodbridge. She had met with EN and told her this and
advised that her daughter, LE, was moving in; but it was only temporary that
she stayed with her boyfriend. The Tenant also testified that since August 2020
her daughter, LE, paid the rent from her chequing
account. The Tenant reiterated that she never moved
out; the rental unit is her home, it is her furniture, and all her mail goes
there.
 
6.     In post-hearing submissions date November 10, 2021, the Tenant submitted
the following that showed her address as the rental unit: Primerica Life Insurance Company
of Canada glistered retirement plan; Services Canada file 2020 and 2019;
and her 2020 T4 slip. Here submissions also included reference to a case the
Landlord had in their disclosure, however it is not necessary
to address this as the Landlord did not enter any post-hearing submissions.
 
7.     Based on all the evidence
and testimony before
me, and the Tenant’s uncontested post- hearing submissions, I find on a balance
of probabilities that the Tenant continues to live
in the rental unit, and as such, has not transferred the unit to any other
occupant. Accordingly, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed; an order
will issue for same.
 
8.     It should be noted that the Tenant’s submissions in
regard to the Landlord breaching obligations
under the Act do not form
part of this order as that issue
is not properly before the
Board.
 
9.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
