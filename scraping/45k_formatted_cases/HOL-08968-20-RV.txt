File Number: HOL-08968-20-RV
 
 



In the matter
of:


41 HUTTON CRESCENT ESSA ON L0M1B6


 




Between:


Salman Zafar


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nichole
St. Croix


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Salman Zafar (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nichole St. Croix (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges.
 
This application was resolved by order HOL-08968-20 issued on July 9, 2021. On July 29, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on November 3, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Representative, Charlene Lewin attended the hearing. The Landlord’s
Representative had problems
with her voice and although
she initially asked for an adjournment,
she indicated she could proceed with the assistance of her friend and with
accommodation. Her voice problem did not prevent
her from speaking at the hearing, at times she whispered and her friend was
permitted to also read her written submissions . The Landlord’s Representative
was adequately able to participate in the review hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord states
there’s an error with respect
to the calculations of arrears
 
2.    
After considering the submissions made, I find the order contains a serious error because
the Board had no authority to order arrears
because the Tenant was not in possession of the rental unit having
vacated on October 30, 2020, when the application was filed on November 22,
2020.
 
3.    
The Board can make an order under sections
69 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) requiring payment of rent arrears and termination only against a tenant in




File Number: HOL-08968-20-RV
 
possession of the rental
unit at the time of the
application in accordance with section 87 1(b) of the Act.
 
4.    
The L1/L9 Update sheet
indicates the Tenant vacated on October 30, 2020 which was reiterated by the Landlord’s Representative at the review hearing.
This finding was made
in the Order issued on July 9, 2020. The Board had no jurisdiction to make an
order against the Tenant because she was not in possession of the rental unit
when the Landlord filed the application.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     Order HOL-08968-20 issued
on July 9, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
2.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
