Huang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Eon De Abreu and Toshica De Abreu (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants

application TNL-34044-21.

December 2021 on or before December 17, 2021. The Order also included a
provision that if the Tenant breached the payment plan, the Landlord could
apply to the Board, under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

condition in the previous order.
 
4.     The Landlord filed this L4 Application on January 28,

More than 30 days have passed
between the date of the last
required payment under the order, which was to take place on December
21, 2021, and the filing
of this application on January 28, 2022. Therefore, this L4 Application is
statute-barred by limitation.
