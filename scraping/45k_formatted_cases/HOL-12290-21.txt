Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12290-21
HOL-12294-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


45 BELLOTTI CRESCENT AJAX ON L1Z0M2


 




Between:


Yinze Li
Jie Ping Zhang


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Simon Halif


Tenant



 
 
 
Yinze Li and Jie Ping Zhang (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Simon
Halif (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied for an
order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the damage; and
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
18, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Both applications were heard
together.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has been persistently late paying rent and has not paid rent in the last five
months.
 
2.     The Landlord submitted photographs of the rental unit and described the damage the Landlord is seeking compensation for to repair the damage.
The Landlord is claiming
$8,000.00. There is damage in several wall locations
which has been patched but must be painted. The
is damage to the 9-year-old refrigerator door.
The Tenant has been smoking in the garage when the Tenant agreed not to
smoke which will require remediation. Based on the photographs and description of the damage
that requires the Landlord to repair the unit due to
the damage caused, I find a reasonable amount of compensation is $1,500.00.
 
3.     I find the Tenant wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit.




 
4.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,750.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
November 1, 2021
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of February
1, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,500.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $4,570.92,
which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 2, 2021 to January 21, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$90.41 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 22, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 2, 2022.
