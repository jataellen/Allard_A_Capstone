304, 183 LISGAR AVENUE
  TILLSONBURG ON N4G3L5


 




Between:


Sireg Management Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Patricia
Charles


Tenant



 
 
Sireg Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy of Patricia
Charles (the ‘Tenant’) because the Tenant has abandoned the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by video conference on November 1, 2021.
 
At 2:14 pm, Navya Menon (NM) the Landlord’s Representative and Wendy Schmeltz (WS) the Landlord’s Agent attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The rental
unit is a 2-bedroom apartment in a multi
unit complex.
 
2.   
The Tenancy
began on or about April 1,
2020.
 
3.   
WS testified that on or
about July 12, 2021, she checked the surveillance footage and noted that on our about July 9, 2021 the Tenant
removed her mattress,
bags and “some other belongings..” out of the
rental unit.
 
4.   
WS indicated
that the Tenant’s
vehicles were not seen in the parking
lots from July 10,
2021 onwards.
 
5.   
On or about July 30, 2021, WS and a construction manager inspected the unit after having served a notice of entry. WS testified that the notice was still
attached to the door. They observed that the Tenant had left food items in the
fridge, “bed boxes” in the room, some furniture, a few utensils and other
miscellaneous items.
 
6.   
WS noted the key had not been returned
to the business office and was found in the unit.




 
7.   
WS testified
that she participated in a second unit inspection on or about October 25, 2021
and noted that a Hydro Disconnect notice dated September 29, 2021 was still
attached to
the door of the Tenant’s unit.
 
8.   
WS provided the Board
with pictures of the rental unit taken as part of the 2 inspections. The pictures
show that the items noted in paragraph
3 were still in the same spot from
the initial inspection and the follow up inspection. None of the items appeared to have been moved.
 
9.   
According to s.2(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act (the ‘Act’):
 
For the purposes of this Act, a
tenant has not abandoned a rental unit if the tenant is not in arrears of rent.
 
10.
WS testified
that the last rental payment
made by the Tenant was April 1, 2021. No further
rent payment have been made by the Tenant.
 
11. Based on the uncontested testimony of
WS as well as the evidence provided, I
am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has abandoned the
unit.
 
12. The Landlord made reasonable efforts to
contact the Tenant by various methods and various times of day. WS spoke with other Tenants in the
residential complex who indicated the Tenant had moved out in July. WS spoke with the individual who collects the mail for the complex and advised her that minimal mail had been delivered to the Tenant’s unit and that
it was reasonable to believe the address had been transferred.
 
13.
Based on the efforts
made by the Landlord to communicate with the Tenant and the
untouched state of the Tenant’s possessions, it is reasonable to determine that the Tenant has left the rental complex. All of the evidence supports the
Landlord’s position that the Tenant has left the rental unit.
 
14.
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant abandoned the rental unit.
