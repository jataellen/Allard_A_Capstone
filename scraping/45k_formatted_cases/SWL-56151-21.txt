Dustin Johnston Winston Halls


Tenants




 
 
 
Hazelview Property
Services Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Dustin Johnston and Winston
Halls (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, John Edlund, and the Landlord’s Agent, Diane Gridzak,
attended the hearing. As of 10:04 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the lawful monthly
rent is $1,012.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $979.33 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 28, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $3,500.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
The amount outstanding to February 28, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($1,524.47), and costs
($186.00), is $1,710.47.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Landlord and Tenant
have agreed to a payment plan and the Landlord requests a conditional order
incorporating the terms of the payment plan.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,710.47, which represents the arrears of rent
($1,524.47), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending February 28,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




February 4, 2022


$750.00
(costs and arrears)




February 18, 2022


$960.47
(arrears)



 
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
