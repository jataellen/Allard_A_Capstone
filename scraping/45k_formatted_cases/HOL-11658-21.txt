Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11658-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2010, 20 SHORE BREEZE
DRIVE TORONTO ON M8V0C7


 




Between:


Reyad Al-mardeni Violette Sousanieh


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Jace O
  Shane Palmer


Tenant



 
 
 
Reyad Al-mardeni and Violette Sousanieh (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jace O
Shane Palmer (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
Reyad Al-mardeni and Violette
Sousanieh (the 'Landlords') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jace O
Shane Palmer (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent (L2 application).
 
This application was heard by video
conference on December 7, 2021.
 
At 10:51 am, Bita Di Lisi the Landlord’s Representative attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The
lawful monthly rent is $2600.00 N4 Notice, L1 Application
 
3.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with an N4 Notice to End Tenancy
for Non-payment of Rent (N4 Notice) on June 30, 2021. The date of termination is July 25, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord is seeking daily compensation and the application filing fee of $201.00.




 
5.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 15, 2021 to December 14, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
July 25, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $2,600.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 14, 2020 to July 25, 2021.
 
8.     The Landlord’s Representative indicated that the
Landlord attempted on several occasions to connect with the Tenant to discuss the issue and offer a payment plan. The
Tenant did not respond.
 
 
 N8 Notice, L2 Application
 
9.    
The Landlord’s L2/N8 application is made pursuant
to an N8 notice served
on the Tenant on June 30, 2021 with a termination date of September 14, 2021. The lease was month-
to-month at the time of service and rent was due on the 15th of
every month.
 
10.  Based on the oral
testimony of the Landlord’s Representative and the
contents of the N8 notice, I find that the Tenant has persistently failed to
pay the rent on the date it was due. As at the date of the hearing, the
Tenant has been late in paying rent 6 months in a row that first became due
starting January 15, 2021.
 
11.  The pattern of late payments
is unmistakable and persistent.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1 application:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay
to the Landlords $20,779.45*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February
11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$85.48 per day for
compensation for the use
of the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 22, 2022, then starting February
23, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes
to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
 
i)               
$27,000.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 14, 2022, or
ii)             
$27,000.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 22, 2022**.
 
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance
with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
 
Regarding the L2 application:
 
9.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated as of
February 22, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
10.  If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
11. 
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
 
February 11, 2022
