Order under
Subsection 74(14)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11367-21-VO
 



In the matter
of:


820 WOOLER PLACE OTTAWA ON K1T0X2


 




Between:


Pratibha Singal
  Sanjeev Singal


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Kweku Kuffuor


Tenant



 
 
Kweku Kuffuor
(the 'Tenant') filed a motion
to set aside order HOL-11367-21 because, before the eviction order was enforced, the Tenant paid the amount
required under subsection 74(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') to void the order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant’s motion
and accompanying declaration state that the Tenant has paid
$7,500.00 to the Landlord by
electronic transfer of funds. The
Tenant paid $2,500.00 on January 4, 2022, January 5, 2022 and January 20, 2022. The total amount the Tenant paid, however,
is less than the amount required to void Board order HOL-11367-20, issued on December 10, 2021, which required the Tenant to pay $11,411.00 on or before January 4, 2022 to void the order.
 
2.    
Because the Tenant did not pay the total amount required
to void the December 10, 2021
hearing order, the Tenant was not entitled to file this motion to void the
order, per subsection 74(11.1) of the Act.
 
3.     The Tenant’s motion must therefore
be denied.
