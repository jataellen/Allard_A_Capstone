Review Order
 
A.A.C.S.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.C.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-77096-17 issued on March 16, 2017.
 
On April
10, 2017, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on May 2, 2017.
 
The
Landlord’s agent, P.L.R., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
REQUEST FOR REVIEW
1.      The
Tenant’s request for review essentially alleges two things. First, it says the
Tenant was not reasonably able to participate and the Landlord committed an
abuse of process by telling him that if a certain amount was paid the
application would be withdrawn. Second, the review alleges the order contains a
serious error with respect to the amount of rent owing because the Landlord is
holding a deposit in excess of the current rent he is charged so the excess
should have been considered rent reducing the arrears claimed. 
2.      The
Landlord did not commit an abuse of process. Rather the Landlord told the
Tenant that if he paid everything owing the application would be withdrawn.
That was true. What the Tenant did not appreciate is that the amount owing
increases as time goes by as new monthly rent comes due and owing. So to pay
everything owing and discontinue an application, a tenant has to have a zero
balance at the time payment is made. The Tenant misunderstood and thought that
by paying the arrears initially claimed, regardless of the new rent that came
due, the application would not proceed. 
3.      That
being said, that is why the Tenant missed the hearing, He had a genuine but
mistaken belief the hearing would not proceed. On that basis the review is
granted. The Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
4.      As
for the second basis for review, the order does not contain a serious error
with respect to the amount charged due to the deposit. 
5.      The
Tenant’s unit is rent-geared-to-income so depending on the subsidy calculation
sometimes his deposit will exceed the monthly rent and sometimes it will not. A
landlord is not permitted to collect a deposit in excess of one month’s rent at
the beginning of the tenancy, but has no obligation to decrease a deposit when
the monthly rent decreases sometime after that. Rather, in this situation, the
obligation the Landlord has is to pay any interest owing to the Tenant directly
as the Landlord can only top up a deposit with interest owing if the deposit is
less than or equal to the monthly rent. 
6.      Given
all of the above, the Tenant’s request for review is granted. Order
TEL-77096-17 issued on March 16, 2017 is cancelled. 
THE
LANDLORD’S APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF THE RENT
7.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2015 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective October 2, 2016.
8.      The
Tenant paid $988.00 after the application was filed. As a result, the arrears
of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017 total $186.00. 
9.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and $376.00 in
non-refundable fees to the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) to enforce the
order that is now cancelled as a result of this review request. The Landlord is
entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
10.   The
total amount the Tenant owes the Landlord is $752.00. 
11.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act. The Tenant can pay the rent arrears owing by the end of
the month but his sole source of income is social assistance so paying back the
filing fees will take some time. He can afford to pay $50.00 a month towards
those fees. The Landlord does not vigorously oppose this proposal of the
Tenant’s so an order will issue accordingly. 
12.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Order
TEL-77096-17 issued on March 16, 2017 is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $752.00 for arrears of rent up to May 31, 2017
and costs.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 2 in
accordance with the following schedule:
(1)  $186.00
on or before May 31, 2017;
(2)  $50.00 plus
the regular monthly rent due to be paid on or before the first day of each
month for the period June 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018; and
(3)  $16.00
plus the regular monthly rent due to be paid on or before May 1, 2018.
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after May 31, 2017.
