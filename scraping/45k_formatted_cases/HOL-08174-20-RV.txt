Review Order
 
 
Wed Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bonnie Varalo and Marcel Varalo
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order HOL-08174-20 issued on April 9, 2021. On May 8, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard via video
conference on July 14, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent, Devon
Daniell, the Tenants,
and the Tenants’ legal representative, Denise Ranger attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review:
 
1.     The issue to be determined by the Board in the request
to review is whether there was a serous error in the order and whether
the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate at the hearing.
 
2.     I have listened
to the audio recording of the hearing
on April 9, 2021. The Tenants were present and participated at the
hearing. The Tenants did not request an adjournment.
 
3.     Based on the audio recording and the evidence
before me, I find that there were serious
errors in the order and in the proceedings.




 
4.    
The Member erred by not
considering the Tenants’ testimony that they provided the Landlord with post dated cheques for the rent, prior to their leaving
in December 2018 to
Florida for the winter.
 
5.    
It is noted in order TET-01657-19,
issued on May 15, 2020, that the Landlord acknowledged receipt of rent cheques up to May 2019. However,
the Landlord did not
cash the cheques, and subsequently destroyed the cheques.
 
6.    
I also find that the Member failed to consider
section 83(3) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (‘the Act’), that the Landlord
was in serious breach of their obligation. Section 83(3) of the Act states:
 
83 (3) Without restricting the generality of subsection (1), the
Board shall refuse to grant the
application where satisfied that,
 
(a)  
the landlord is in serious breach of the landlord’s
responsibilities under this Act or of
any material covenant in the tenancy agreement;
 
7.     The Tenants raised the issue of a serous breach as
they did not have electricity and water in the unit and were granted
a continued rent abatement of 85% until these utilities (electricity, heat, water) were
restored (pursuant to order TET-01657-19).
 
8.    
At the review hearing,
the Landlord confirmed
that the utilities
have not been restored to the unit.
 
9.     Based on the evidence before
me, I granted the review
and proceeded to have a de novo
hearing (new) on the L1 application.
 
L1 application:
 
1.     The monthly rent is $619.30
and the rent is due on the first day of each month.
 
2.     As I stated at the hearing, the Landlord’s Form N4 Notice of Termination was defective as it did not state the correct rental
period for February 2020 (did not indicate the end of the month). As such, the
rent owed for the period March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 was not correct.
 
3.     A Form N4 Notice of Termination should accurately reflect
the rental period,
the rent charged, the rent
paid and the rent owing.
 
4.     The Landlord sought
to terminate the tenancy, and a tenancy
cannot terminate on a
defective notice.
 
5.     As I stated
at the hearing, the Landlord’s application is dismissed without prejudice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-08174-20 issued
on April 9, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:




 
2.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed without
prejudice.
