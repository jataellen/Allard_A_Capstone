File Number: TSL-20825-21

of:


0020, 35 SWORDBILL DRIVE ETOBICOKE ON M9A4V3


 




Between:


Hi-lo Investments Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jolanta Dziura
  Marta Dziura


Tenants



 
 
 
Hi-lo Investments Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marta Dziura
and Jolanta Dziura
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on July 21, 2021 at
9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord, represented by
Sharon Harris, a licensed Paralegal, and Tenant, Marta Dziurra, representing herself
attended the hearing.
Jolanta Dziura, was unable to attend the hearing but was represented by her daughter Marta Dziura.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to July 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed,
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,1714.50
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,682.12
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 25, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $9,887.50 after the application was filed.




 
7.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $1,200.00
including arrears of rent
to July 31, 2021 of $1014.00 and the application fee of $186.00.
 
8.    
Since the hearing, another
six rental periods
have begun, and six
more month’s rent have
become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021,
December 2021 and January 2022’s rent.
 
9.     If the Tenant
has paid the Landlord August
2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021, December 2021 and
January 2022’s rent and /or made any payments to the Landlord since the
hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the amount owing in this
order.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord’s Representative sought a
Standard Order. At the hearing, the Landlord’s Legal Representative was
amenable to extending the eviction date to July 31, 2021. As this order is
being issued on January 19, 2021, this extension has effectively already been granted.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,943.16*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$56.37 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.




 
8.    
If, on or before January 30, 2022,
the Tenants pay the amount of $11,487.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
