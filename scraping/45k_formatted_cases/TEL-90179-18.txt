V.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.A.H. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the commencement of the
hearing, I asked the Tenant about his request to have an interpreter present at
the hearing.  The Board spoke with the Tenant on April 18, 2018 and it is noted
that the Tenant was to bring a friend with him to help with any translation. 
The Tenant did not bring anyone with him.
2.    
I told the Tenant if he has
any trouble understanding anything said during the proceedings to ask for
clarification.  He was in agreement and the hearing proceeded.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 9, 2018.
2.    
The Tenant stated that he
lost his job December 2016.  He began a new job as of February 20, 2018. 
During the year he was unemployed his family helped him out with rent.  The
payment he made on May 4, 2018 was due to a friend of his coming to his aid.
3.    
He proposed a repayment plan
of $500.00 a month in order to pay off the arrears.  This would take the Tenant
approximately 14 months to bring the balance to zero.
4.    
The Landlord objected to the
request stating he has had discussions with the Tenant before and he said the
same thing but did not fulfill the terms of the agreement.  The Landlord does
not have trust in the Tenant to adhere to any agreement at this point.  
5.    
Based on the testimony of
both parties, it is clear neither party wants to be in the position they are
currently in.  The Landlord said he would like to help the Tenant but cannot
afford to keep the Tenant afloat as he has his mortgage to pay.  
6.    
Given the lack of evidence
to support the Tenant’s request for a repayment plan, I find that it is
unreasonably long and it would be prejudicial to the Landlord if I were to
grant the plan.  The Tenant then stated that he could pay the arrears in two
payments.  Again, there is a lack of evidence to persuade me that any type of
repayment plan is warranted.
7.    
The Landlord would be
willing to delay the termination until June 15, 2018.  I find this to be a
reasonable date and it is granted.
8.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,700.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
9.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2018 to April 9, 2018.
10.  The Tenant paid $1,700.00 after the application
was filed.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until June 15, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
12.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 15,
2018.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,270.19*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $55.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 17, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 15, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 16,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 15, 2018, then starting June 16, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 16, 2018.
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)       $6,975.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)      $8,675.00 if the payment is made on or before June 15, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 16, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
