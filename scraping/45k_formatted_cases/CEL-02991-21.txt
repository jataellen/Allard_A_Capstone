Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02991-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3 ALBION CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L6T1L3


 




Between:


Maninder Dhaliwal


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Davis


Tenant



 
 
 
Maninder Dhaliwal (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle Davis (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January 27, 2022. The
Landlord, represented by Francisco Gomez, and the Tenant, assisted
by her father, attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Matters:
 
The Tenant and her father met
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing. They
were directed to point out that the notice
served on the Tenant does not identify
the rental unit as required
under section 43.1(a) of the Act.
 
The Tenant
lives on the main floor of a house. There is no designated unit number beyond
the house address. The Tenant testified that all the tenants receive their mail in the same mailbox, and that she takes the mail that is addressed to her. The Tenant also testified she received the notice.
 
I find the notice
does identify the rental unit, which is the house,
and that the Tenant was properly
served.
 
At the hearing, the Landlord requested
the consent of the Board to withdraw
the portion of the
application as it relates to the N5 notice without prejudice.




File Number: CEL-02991-21
 
In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the N5 portion of the application without prejudice.

1.     The Tenant has been persistently late paying rent.
 
2.     At the hearing
agreed to an order, commencing February 1, 2022, to pay the rent in full and on time for the next twelve

1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing February 2022 and continuing through
January 2023.
 
2.    
In the event the Tenant fails to make the above
conditions, the Landlord shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order,
without notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.
