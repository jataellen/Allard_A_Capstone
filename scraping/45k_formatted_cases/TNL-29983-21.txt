Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
File Number: TNL-29983-21
 



In the matter
of:


2016,
  7 LORRAINE DRIVE NORTH YORK ON M2N7H2


 




Between:


Nilma Ponte


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Kyoung Sun Lee


Tenant



 
Nilma Ponte (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kyoung
Sun Lee (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage
to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage
and compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after
the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 25, 2021.
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative
Chris Williams attended
the hearing. As of 10:25 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Preliminary matter:
At the hearing the Landlord’s
Representative advised that the Tenant
vacated and moved
out of the rental unit on or
about August 27, 2021.
 
Determinations:
1.    
The Tenant is no longer an occupant of the unit and the Landlord’s application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenant is
therefore moot.
 
Damages
 
2.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The L2 application filed by the Landlord with the
Board also claims that the Tenant or another
occupant of the rental unit has wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit or residential
complex.




 
4.    
The Landlord asserts that on December
16, 2020 the Landlord completed
an annual inspection of the
rental unit and found signs of hoarding and damage resulting from excessive
garbage/debris and human feces.
 
5.    
The Landlord gave a N5 notice to the Tenant on January 1, 2021 alleging
that the Tenant has not maintained the rental unit
in a ‘livable condition’.
 
6.     Under section 33 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’), a tenant is responsible for the ordinary cleanliness of the rental
unit, just as a Landlord
under section 20 of the Act is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for
habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance
standards.
 
7.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative testified that the extent of the condition
of the unit required the Landlord
to bring in a health
and safety specialist to remove the excessive
garbage, complete repairs and sanitize the unit before it could be re-rented.
 
8.    
The Landlord submitted a quotation for the restoration totalling $22,600.00 to repair the damage and/or replace property that
was damaged and cannot be repaired.
 
9.    
Section 89 (1) of the Act
provides, that a landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a
tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for
the repair of or, where
repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
10.  This wording means that a landlord must establish that it is more likely
than not that the
tenant, an occupant or a guest, wilfully or negligently caused each item of the
property damage claimed.
 
11.  On any application before the Board,
the party making
an allegation in an application has the onus of proving those allegations on a balance of
probabilities.
 
12.  The standard of proof requires the party to show with
evidence that, “more likely than not”, their assertions are true and that evidence “must be sufficiently clear,
convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”
 
13.  The Landlord submitted a number of photographs of the
condition of the unit and the
claimed damage.
 
14.  The Tenant did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
15.  I reviewed the Landlord’s documents submitted and I am
satisfied based on the uncontested testimony of the Landlord, on a balance of
probabilities, the Tenant, or another occupant of the rental
unit has wilfully
caused undue damage
to the premises and the Landlord has incurred or will incur costs of
$22,600.00 to repair the damage and/or replace property that was damaged and
cannot be reasonably repaired.




 
 
 
16.  This order contains
all the reason for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$22,600.00 which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay the total amount
owing** to the Landlord on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Landlord has the right anytime after March 1, 2022 to
collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding balance as a result
of this order.
