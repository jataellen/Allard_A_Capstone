In the matter of:      1111, 955 WARWICK

Antonio Depasquale Tara Gould


Tenants




 
On October 7, 2021,
Hazelview Properties (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Antonio Depasquale and Tara Gould (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the hearing order issued
by the Board on September 7, 2021 with respect to L1 application SOL-18192-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The hearing order provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The
Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord $760.00 on or before September 15, 2021 towards
costs and arrears
of rent. This was a breach of paragraph 2(a) of the hearing
order.
 
The Tenants
also failed to pay to the Landlord
$9,041.36 on or before
September 30, 2021 (towards July, August and September’s rent and
$5,000.00 from Region of Halton towards
arrears of rent).
Only
$4,041.36 was paid by the Tenants,
which was a breach of paragraph
2(a) of the hearing order.
 
This L4 application was filed within
30 days of the two breaches
described above.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting hearing order
required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent.
Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.




 
4.       
In paragraph 1 of the hearing
order, the Tenants were ordered to pay $18,156.96 for rent arrears and the
costs related to the Landlord's L1 application
fee in Order SOL-18192-20.
The amount that is still owing from that order is $14,115.60 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
hearing order SOL-18192-20 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have also failed to
pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.
 
6.       
On December 16, 2009 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,347.12 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest was last paid out
up to October 31, 2020.
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from
November 1, 2020 to January 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous hearing order
SOL-18192-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those
amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $14,110.47*. This amount represents the rent owing up to October 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous
L1 application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$44.29 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 1, 2021 to the date the
Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board

and the Board will schedule a hearing.
