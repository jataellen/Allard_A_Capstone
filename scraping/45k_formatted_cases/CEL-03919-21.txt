Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03919-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 128 MILL STREET NORTH BRAMPTON ON L6X2P2


 




Between:


Basant Nanuan


Landlord




 


and


 




 


 
Esper Powell Mark McClymonth Soraya Kinlocke Wayne Kinlocke


 
Tenants



 
 
 
Basant Nanuan
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Soraya
Kinlocke, Wayne Kinlocke, Mark McClymonth and Esper Powell (the 'Tenants')
because the Landlord intends to do major repairs or renovations to the rental
unit. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 13, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Manjit
Garcha, and the Tenants, Esper Powell and Mark
McClymonth attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant,
Esper Powell, spoke
with Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons that follow, I find that the notice
to terminate the tenancy
because the Landlord requires vacant
possession of the rental unit to do extensive
pursuant to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) is
fatally flawed, and therefore, not valid. Since the notice is not valid, the
Landlord’s application cannot be granted.
 
2.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with a Notice to Terminate a Tenancy at the End of the Term for Demolition, Conversion or
Repair (the ‘N13’), on October 20, 2021. The N13 notice gave a termination date
of January 31, 2022. The N13 notice indicates the Landlord requires vacant
possession of the rental unit to do extensive renovations to bring the basement
unit up to code.
 
3.    
Section 50 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) says:




File Number: CEL-03919-21
 
(1)   A landlord may give notice
of termination of a tenancy
if the landlord requires possession of the rental unit in order
to,
(a) 
demolish it;
(b) 
convert it to use for a purpose
other than residential premises; or
(c) 
do repairs or renovations to it that are so extensive that they require
a building permit
and vacant possession of the rental unit.
 
(2)  
The date for termination specified
in the notice shall be at least 120 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the
tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
(3)  
A notice under clause (1) (c) shall inform the
tenant that if he or she wishes to exercise the right of first refusal under
section 53 to occupy the premises after the repairs or renovations, he or she must give the landlord
notice of that fact in accordance with subsection
53 (2) before vacating the rental unit.
 
(4)  
A tenant who receives notice of termination under subsection (1) may, at any time before
the date specified in the notice, terminate the tenancy, effective on a
specified date earlier than the date set out in the landlord’s notice.
 
(5)   The date for termination specified in the tenant’s
notice shall be at least
10 days after the date the tenant’s notice is
given.
[Emphasis added]
 
 
4.    
Here, the time between
the date the notice was served, October 20, 2021 and the termination date,
January 31, 2022, is 103 days not the 120 days as required by s.50(2)
of the At. As such the notice does not comply with the legislation and the
Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
5.    
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
