Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26834-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 229 DARLING
STREET BRANTFORD ON N3S3X3


 




Between:


Mark Lederer


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Julie King


Tenant



 
 
 
Mark Lederer (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Julie
King (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not appropriate to require the Tenant
to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.
