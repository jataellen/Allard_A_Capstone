Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-89604-18
 











 
 
 

S. A., D. P., S. P. and B. A. A. (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A. G. (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
S. A., D. P., S. P. and B. A. A. (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A. G. (the 'Tenant')
because he, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard in Whitby on April 30,
2018.
 
Only the Landlords attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
            L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to April
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective February 23, 2018.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,050.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 23,
2018.
4.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
5.     
The tenancy agreement
provides that the Tenant is to reimburse the Landlord for any utility charges
over and above $50.00 monthly. The Landlord delivered several notices to the
Tenant requesting payments, as set out in the N5 notice that was served on the
Tenant. The Tenant did not provide payment.
6.     
The Tenant’s conduct has interfered
with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords by failing to pay
outstanding utility bills pursuant to the lease agreement.
7.     
The Tenant did not correct
the problem by paying the outstanding bills during the seven days following the
Landlords’ service of the N5 Notice of Termination. Therefore, the N5 Notice of
Termination was not voided by the Tenant.
8.     
The update sheet provided by
the Landlord indicates that the Tenant owes $157.65 to the Landlord for unpaid
utility bills. The Landlord did not present evidence on how this nominal amount
of arrears has affected his rights.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act subject to
the condition that the Tenant pay the outstanding utility bills. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 15, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $3,268.22*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to May 4, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords
owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $35.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 5, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before May 15, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 16,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 15, 2018, then starting May 16, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 16, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before May 15,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,515.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 16, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
10.  
If the Tenant voids the L1
portion on this application by making the payment required in paragraph 8
above, the tenancy shall continue on the condition that the Tenant pays the
Landlord $157.65 in respect of the unpaid utility bills on or before May 15,
2018.
11.   If the Tenant fails to make payment in
accordance with paragraph 10, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
