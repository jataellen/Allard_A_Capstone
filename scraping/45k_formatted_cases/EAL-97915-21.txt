Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97915-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


345 KING GEORGE
STREET OTTAWA ON K1K1T6


 




Between:


Ottawa Community Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Madonna Ring aka Madonna Stewart


Tenant



 
 
Ottawa Community Housing (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Madonna
Ring aka Madonna
Stewart (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord's
Representative, Beth Cumming, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord filed their L1
application on September 29, 2021 however, based on the oral evidence provided
by the Tenant at the hearing, I find that the Tenant vacated the rental unit on September
14, 2021. The Tenant was not in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     At the onset of the hearing, the Tenant sought an
adjournment to obtain further legal counsel and the Landlord opposed
the request. During an exploration of the adjournment request, an issue arose
regarding whether or not the Tenant was in possession of the rental unit when
the Landlord filed their application.
 
3.     The Tenant testified that she moved out of the unit on
September 14, 2021 and that she had abandoned any items remaining in the rental
unit as of September 14, 2021. The
Tenant confirmed that she did not provide the Landlord with notice that she had
left at that time, but during the hearing the Tenant confirmed that the Landlord
could dispose of any items that remain in the rental
unit.
 
4.     The Landlords concern was whether or not they could
put the rental unit back on the market to re-rent
it to a new tenant
and therefore they requested that the order confirm
the oral evidence of the Tenant at the hearing.




File Number: EAL-97915-21
 
5.    
I
did not make any determinations regarding arrears of rent that may have been owing
as of the hearing and therefore the Landlord is not estopped from
pursing their claim for the arrears of rent up to the date that the Tenant
vacated the rental unit in a subsequent application under subsection 87 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 with a Form
L10.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
 
February 2, 2022 Date Issued
 
Eastern-RO
255 Albert Street, 4th Floor
