In the
  matter of:


3, 615 MCINTYRE STREET E NORTH BAY
  ON P1B1E6


 




Between:


John Miller


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Carley Gerling
  Warren Jesso


Tenants



 
 
 
John Miller (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Warren
Jesso and Carley Gerling (the 'Tenants') because the conduct of the
tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with
the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by
the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 25, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenants were not present
or represented despite being served with the notice of
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On June 15, 2021 the Landlord
served the Tenants
with a first N5 notice to terminate
the tenancy pursuant to subsection 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Termination date in the notice is July 5, 2021.
 
2.    
At the outset of the hearing
I raised the potential issue of the N5 notice
being invalid and heard submissions from the Landlord. After considering the submissions I advised that I was dismissing the application for reasons to
follow. These are my reasons.
 
3.     Subsection 64(2) of the Act sets out the required elements
for a valid N5 Notice: 64(2) A notice of termination
under subsection (1) shall,
(a)  provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after the notice
is given;
 
(b) 
set out the grounds
for termination; and




File Number: NOL-43298-21
 
(c) 
require the tenant, within seven
days, to stop the conduct or activity or correct the omission set out in the
notice.
 
4.    
On the notice, the Landlord did not check off whether
this is the first or second N5 Notice.
A first N5 notice allows a tenant to void the notice by correcting the
behaviour outlined in the notice within a 7-day remedy period. A second N5 notice has no remedy period.
 
5.     Since the Landlord
did not indicate whether this was a first or second N5 notice, it was
unclear as to whether or not the Tenant could void the notice in order to
preserve the tenancy.
 
6.     As a result,
I find that the N5 notice is defective on its face and the Landlord cannot
rely on the notice to terminate the tenancy.
 
7.     The Landlord had served another
N5 with a termination date of July 13, 2021. However,
the certificate of service filed with the Board does not indicate the date the
notice was served.
 
8.     In any event,
having found that the first N5 notice was defective, the Landlord cannot rely
on the second N5 notice to terminate the tenancy. The Landlord did not satisfy a statutory precondition for
serving a second N5 under s. 68 of the Act – that being the service of a valid
N5 under s. 64.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
