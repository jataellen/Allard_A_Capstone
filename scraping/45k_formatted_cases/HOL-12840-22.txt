Toronto College
Park Ltd. c/o GWL Realty
Advisors Residential Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and
evict Olivier Jean Mvilongo (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant gave a notice to
terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant gave the Landlord a notice to terminate the
Tenant's tenancy effective January 31, 2022.
Although the notice does not comply with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act) because the Tenant did not
provide at least 60 days notice, the Landlord agrees to the termination of the
tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
