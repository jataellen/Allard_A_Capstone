Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-99000-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


210, 10 KENSINGTON ROAD BRAMPTON ON L6T3V4


 




Between:


Bpa Corp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tanraz Magher Singh
Nagra


Tenant



 
 
 
Bpa Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tanraz Magher
Singh Nagra (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on July 5,
2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sam Ursino, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to July 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination
effective February 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,585.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2020
to February 26, 2021.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant submitted
that he lost his employment and that
he experienced a lot of financial difficulties. The Tenant is not disputing the
amount claimed by the Landlord. The Tenant submitted that he is unable to pay
the monthly rent and that he can only pay $200 to $300 monthly. The Tenant also stated that his wife is expecting
a baby in September 3, 2021. I acknowledge
the personal and financial difficulty that the Tenant is experiencing. However,
I must also consider the prejudice caused to the Landlord by having the Tenant
remain in the rental unit without making rent payments. Considerable amount of
time has passed since the hearing, which should assist the Tenant in making alternative arrangements to find a new

home for him and his family.
After considering the submissions of both parties,
I find that this tenancy is not viable as the Tenant cannot afford this
rental unit. There is no mutual benefit to prolonging this tenancy and I see no
reason to deny the eviction requested by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $17,434.76*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $52.11
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$19,206.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$20,791.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
