Between:


Kirti Chauhan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abhayjeet Malhotra (a.k.a.
Malhotra Singh) Gurpreet

  Sarbjot Singh


Tenants



 
 
L1 Application
Kirti Chauhan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Abhayjeet Malhotra (a.k.a. Malhotra
Singh), Gurpreet Signh, Jobanjeet Singh, and Sarbjot Singh (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
L2 Application
The Landlord applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
On October 21, 2021, Abhayjeet
Malhotra, Gurpreet Singh, Jobanjeet Singh and Sarbjot Singh (the 'Tenants') requested that order CEL-95868-20 issued on April 19, 2021 (the ‘Board Order’),
be reviewed and that the order be stayed until their request to review the
order is resolved.
 
The Board issued Interim
Order CEL-95868-20-RV-IN on October 27, 2021 granting
the request for a review and
a review hearing.
 
This review hearing was heard via videoconference on December 20,
2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants Jobanjeet Singh, Sarbjot singh and Gurpreet
Signh attended the hearing.
 
At the outset of the review
hearing, the Tenants
confirmed that Abhayjeet
Malhotra and Malhotra Singh was the same person and
that Gurpreet Signh was also a Tenant. Therefore, on consent the application
was amended to reflect this.




 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the outset
of the hearing the Landlord
consented to the review. Therefore
the applications were heard de novo.
 
L1 application
 
2.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2020 to December
31, 2020. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective June 26, 2020.
 
3.    
It was agreed by the parties
that the Tenants
had vacated the rental unit as of September
4, 2020.
 
4.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed with the
Board. The monthly rent is $2,600.00.
 
5.     The Landlord testified
that the arrears
for the period
ending September 30, 2020 was
$10,200.00.
 
6.     The Tenants disputed
this amount, believing that they had paid $2,500.00
to the Landlord which had not been accounted for. I provided the
Tenants with time to submit proof of payment as a post-hearing submission.
 
7.    
I have reviewed the post hearing
submission on the $2,500.00 payment and I am not satisfied that there is
sufficient evidence to show that the Tenants paid $2,500.00 to the Landlord. I say this because the bank statements do not show who received
the payment dated in the bank
statement on August 31, 2020 the sum of $2,500.00. In addition, the Tenants testified that they did not make a payment
in August as they thought
that the rent deposit would be applied to the
month of August.
 
8.    
The Bank statement did show a $2,600.00 etransfer
on July 31, 2020, and the Landlord did confirm at the hearing that
this amount had been received and accounted for.
 
9.     Therefore, I am satisfied that the arrears owing up to
September 4, 2020 is $8,541.92. This amount reflects
a daily rate of $85.48
for September and not the entire months
rent.
 
10.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
11.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 30, 2019 to June 26, 2020.
 
L2 application
 
12.  The Landlord requested
to withdraw the L2 application on basis that the Tenants
had vacated, and I consented to this request.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The review is granted.
 
2.     Order, CEL-95868-21 issued
April 19, 2021 is cancelled
and cannot be enforced.
 
3.     Order CEL-95868-21-RV-IN issued
October 27, 2021 is cancelled and no longer in force.
 
4.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated as of September
4, 2020, the day the Tenants provided vacant possession to the Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,899.45, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
4, 2021, less the rent deposit ($2,600.00) and interest ($42.47) the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
6.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
7.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
8.     The L2 application is dismissed.
