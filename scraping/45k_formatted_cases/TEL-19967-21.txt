2667339 Ontario Ltd. (the

(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
5:40 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 25, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on December
31, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,000.00.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 15, 2021 to September 25, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy is terminated as of December 31, 2021,
the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit
to the Landlord.

2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,011.17*, which
represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
