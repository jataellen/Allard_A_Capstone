Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Ann Marie Maunder Tamatha Jones


Tenants



 
 
 
Cameron Mart and
Carl Mart (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Ann Marie Maunder and Tamatha Jones (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants, an occupant
of the rental unit or an invited guest has substantially interfered with
another tenant’s or the Landlords’ reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex or the lawful rights, privileges or interests of the Landlord.
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
The Landlords and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Preliminary:
 
1.    
The first
N5 Notice with a termination date of July 30, 2021 does not have to be voided in
order for Landlord to issue the second N5 but second N5 must be given after the
seven- day voiding period and before 6 months after the first N5 Notice is given. The second N5 Notice was given
after the seven-day voiding period but include incidents about the Tenant’s
conduce within the seven-day voiding period, they are those between July 10,
2021 to July 17, 2021. Therefore, only the incidents that took place after the
seven-day voiding period from July 18, 2021 on the second N5 Notice were
considered.
 
Determinations:
 
2.     The Landlord received
a complaint about loud banging
and stomping on August 14, 2021.
The age of the complex is around 100 years old and there was no evidence about
what structural noise barrier lay between the units. The Landlord provided no documentary evidence from the
complaining tenant and the complaining tenant was not present to provide
testimony. The Tenants’ testified
they have taken steps by laying down carpets and blankets on the floors to
minimize noise. The Tenant works nights and I find the




File Number: SOL-24544-21
 
Landlord has not established that the noise from the Tenant was excessive or abnormal
beyond what one would expect during common use.
 
3.    
The Landlord received a
complaint that the Tenants’ visitors were inspecting and testing another
tenant’s doorknob on August 16, 2021. The Tenant wasn’t informed of the
incident and the Landlord did not investigate or speak to her to verify the
persons were visitors or guests of the Tenant. There’s no indication that the
complaining tenant called police which would have been appropriate if someone attempted
to break and enter their unit.
 
4.     On August 18, 2021, a person knocked
on another tenant’s
door asking for narcotics. The information was hearsay which the Tenant challenged. The Tenant did not know anything about the incident.
There was not enough evidence to establish the person who caused the
disturbance was an invited guest of the Tenant.
 
5.    
The Landlord could not
recall whether he spoke to the Tenant about any of these incidents. The
Landlord has not provided enough evidence to satisfied me that the Tenants, an occupant or invited guest of the Tenants substantially interfered with another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of
the rental unit.
 
6.    
Since the Landlord did not satisfy
section 64 (1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), the
Landlord’s application for an eviction order is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The application is dismissed.
