Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Troy White and Stephanie Greshuk
(the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on September 16, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49801-21.
 
This matter was directed
to hearing to clarify the breach(es). This application was heard by videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris, and the Tenant,
Stephanie Greshuk, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
pay
$1,250.00 on or before September
13, 2021. At the original hearing the Tenant had said she had already paid
$1,250.00 via 3 payments prior to the hearing. As these payments could not be verified
at the time the amount
of $1,250.00 was included as a payment
due September 13, 2021. If already paid as testified to then this callus
was met. The actual payments made by the Tenant were $250.00 on August 25, 201,
$500.00 on August 30, 2021 and $450.00 on September 8, 2021, for a total of
$1,200.00 which leaves the September 13th payment
short $50.00.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of




 
rent. Accordingly, in addition
to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $7,809.88 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-49801-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,359.88
and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-49801-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $14.33 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to February 17, 2022.
 
7.     The Landlord’s Legal
Representative testified that at the time of hearing the Tenant paid
$750.00 in October 2021 and
$500.00 on November 23, 2021; the total arrears now owing including the
application filing fee to November 30, 2021 is $7,372.48. Based on the fact
that amount of arrears owing to date is almost the same as what is owing at
hearing, and the Tenant has breached since the L4 application was filed, the Landlord is seeking a non-voidable 1-day standard
order for eviction.
 
8.     The Tenant did not dispute
the amount owing. She testified that shortly after entering into the payment arrangement her hours at
work dropped from 40 to 17 hours per week. The Tenant further testified that
she has lived in the unit almost 7 years and would like one more chance to save
her tenancy; she has asked for help from the Salvation Army but has not heard
back. If she could not pay the arrears she asked until the end of January 2022
to vacate.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant requested until January 31, 2022 to vacate if she was not able to pay the arrears. As this date is already
passed, the standard order requested by the Landlord is reasonable.
 
10.  This order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-49801-21 is cancelled and replaced with the following.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,345.75*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 17, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.




 
 
 
4.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $33.08
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 18, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
