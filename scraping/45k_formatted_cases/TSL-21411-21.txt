Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-21411-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2509, 1234 MAIN
STREET
UPPER SHENANIGANS ON M8Z2J7


 




Between:


Mister Darcy


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth Bennett


Tenant



 
 
 
Mister Darcy (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Elizabeth Bennett (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 15, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period March 1,
2022 to February 28, 2023.
 
2.     If the Tenant
fails to comply
with paragraph 1 of this order, the Landlord may, without
notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board within 30 days of the Tenant’s breach pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
