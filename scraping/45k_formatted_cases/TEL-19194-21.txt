In the matter
of:


416, 1040 CEDAR STREET OSHAWA ON L1J3R7


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Timothy Young


Tenant



 
 
 
Medallion
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Timothy Young (the 'Tenant') of a superintendent's premises, because the
Tenant's employment as superintendent has ended. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Samuel Korman, attended the hearing. As of 11:12 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord terminated the
employment of the Tenant on August 13, 2021. The Tenant vacated the
superintendent's premises on December 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord is seeking
compensation for the Tenant’s use of the unit commencing on August 21, 2021 until the date the Tenant
vacated the unit.
 
3.     Sections 93 and 94 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) provide as follows:
 
93(1) If a landlord has entered into a tenancy agreement with respect to
a superintendent’s premises, unless otherwise agreed, the tenancy terminates on
the day on which the employment of the tenant is terminated.
 
(2)  A tenant shall vacate a
superintendent’s premises within one week after his or her tenancy is terminated.




 
 
 
(3)   A landlord shall not charge a tenant
rent or compensation or receive rent or compensation from a tenant with respect
to the one-week period mentioned in subsection (2).
 
94 The landlord may apply to the Board for an order terminating the
tenancy of a tenant of superintendent’s premises and evicting the tenant if the
tenant does not vacate the rental unit within one week of the termination of
his or her employment.
 
4.    
Section 93(2) of
the Act makes it clear that superintendents must vacate the unit within one
week after employment ends. When a tenant does not vacate a superintendent unit
pursuant to the Act, a landlord is entitled to file an application under
section 94 of the Act for termination of the tenancy.
 
5.    
While section
93(3) of the Act states that the landlord cannot charge a tenant any rent for
the first seven days after the termination of their employment, there is no
mention in this section of whether the landlord is entitled to compensation
from the tenant if the tenant remains in the rental unit after the seven day
period has expired. Section 86 of the Act entitles a landlord to compensation
for use and occupation of a rental unit by a tenant after the tenancy has terminated
as a result of notice, agreement of Board order. Moreover, s. 87(3) allows a
landlord to apply to the Board for an order requiring an overholding tenant to
pay compensation.
 
6.    
In my view, it is
unlikely that the Legislature intended to confer a right to compensation upon a
landlord under s. 93 without allowing that landlord to pursue a remedy before
the Board. In my view, it is likely that a superintendent unit’s tenancy
terminates upon termination of the employment relationship. Thus, when the superintendent
is given notice that their employment
is terminated, this constitutes notice that the tenancy is termination as well.
Accordingly, I find I have jurisdiction to award compensation to the Landlord
for the use of the unit by the Tenant.
 
7.    
In this case, the
Tenant’s seven day rent free period ran from August 13, 2021 to August 20,
2021. The Tenant did not vacate the
unit until December 18, 2021. Consequently,
the Tenant owes the Landlord compensation for the use of the unit from August
21, 2021 until December 18, 2021.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of
December 18, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,734.00, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from
August 21, 2021 to December 18, 2021.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month’s
rent deposit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
