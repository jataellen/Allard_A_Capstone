Order under Section 30
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-31537-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


19828 YONGE STREET HOLLAND LANDING ON L9N1A9


 




Between:


Xiao Liu


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Yuqiao Hu


Landlord



 
 
Xiao Liu (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Yuqiao Hu (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the
Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January
19, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by Rong Wei Yu. The Tenant consulted Tenant Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the beginning of the hearing, I
raised a preliminary issue with respect to the Tenant’s T6 application filed on March 25, 2021 and the amended application filed on January
13, 2022. Specifically, both applications fail to identify
the maintenance issues
and the dates they began. Both applications state, in the reasons
section, that:
 
THE HOUSE HAS PROBLEMS AND HAS
NOT COMPLIED WITH HEALTH, SAFETY, HOUSING STANDARDS. I USED PHONE AND MESSAGE
INFORM LANDLORDS AND DISCUSSED WITH LANDLORDS MANY TIMES. LANDLORDS DID NOT ARRANGE REPAIRS.
 
2.     I inquired with the Tenant whether he had submitted a
separate sheet with this information when he filed the application, but his response
was he did not. The Landlord
confirmed receiving the same application as was filed with the Board.
 
3.    
Applications must provide sufficient detail to allow the opposing
party to know the specific allegations being made so that
the opposing party can be in a position to know the case that must be met: Ball
v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931 (“Ball”).
 
4.    
MacDougall J. wrote in Ball that,
“Particulars should include, dates and times of the alleged offensive conduct together with a detailed
description of the alleged conduct...” While Ball involved a
notice of termination served to a tenant, in my view the general




File Number: TNT-31537-21
 
principles regarding the need for particular and details apply equally to tenant
applications.
 
5.     In Ball, the Court stated that the various purposes
for requiring a party to provide reasons and details include the responding party’s
need “to know the specific
allegations made so that she/he can be in a position to
know the case that must be met; to decide whether to dispute the allegations
made before the Tribunal; and to consider whether to stop the conduct or
activity or correct the omission…”
 
6.     Here the Tenant’s
application fails to set out what the maintenance issues
were that were in a state of disrepair and what
dates they were out of service; it further fails to outline when the Landlord
was advised of the issues (if at all), and what they did (if they did anything
at all). It further fails to mention whether the maintenance issues have been
rectified as of the date of filing the application. Without such details, it is
impossible for the responding party to provide a proper defense.
 
7.     In light of the above, the Tenant’s
application must be
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant's application is dismissed.
