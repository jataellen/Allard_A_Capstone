Fraser Wilson James

Tenants



 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Fraser Wilson and James Vella-White (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlord also
claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Michelle Beaton, attended the hearing. As of
10:25 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,051.02.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $80.00
for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,051.02 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenants for the period from August
1, 2020 to July 31, 2021.
