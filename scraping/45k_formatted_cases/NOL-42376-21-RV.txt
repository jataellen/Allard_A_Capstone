Review Order
 
Roland Carpenter
and Barbara Carpenter
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Pierre Lafleur (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order NOL-42376-21 issued on August
19, 2021.
 
On September 2, 2021, the Tenant requested
a review of the
order and that the order be stayed until the request to review the
order is resolved.
 
On September 3, 2021, interim
order NOL-42376-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order. The request was
heard by videoconference on December 7, 2021.
The Landlords’ representative, A. Gravelle, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred
in the proceedings.
 
2.     The Tenant alleged he did not have a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the proceeding.
The Tenant attended the hearing but was not present at 4.28 pm when the
matter was heard. In the request to review the Tenant claimed that after
unsuccessful mediation, the moderator put him in the hearing room but shortly
after that he was disconnected. The Tenant stated that he tried to reconnect
but was not readmitted to the
hearing.




File Number: NOL-42376-21
 
3.     I have reviewed
the Hearing Recording
and docket notes. There is no indication from the moderator
or the Hearing Member that the Tenant was having technical difficulties. The
recording also reflects that the
Tenant was not disconnected shortly after mediation. The Tenant was in the conference for 30 minutes before
disconnecting. More probable than not, the Tenant was resigned to receiving a
standard eviction order after failed mediation and therefore decided that it
was not worth waiting until late afternoon for the likely outcome.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order NOL-42376-21 issued on August 19, 2021, is
denied. The order is confirmed
and remains unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on September 3, 2021,
is cancelled. The stay of order NOL- 42376-21 is lifted.
