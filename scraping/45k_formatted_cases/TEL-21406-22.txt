Justin Dwayne Strickland

Tenants



 
 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin Dwayne Strickland and Stefania Bruno (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January
6, 2022 with respect to application TEL-19481-21-AM.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1850.00 rent on or before December
31, 2021.The Tenants
did not pay $600.00 arrears on or before January 12, 2022. The Tenants
did not pay
$1850.00 rent on or before January
12, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction,
the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent
and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $10,236.00 for rent arrears
and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-19481-21-AM. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$10,236.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order TEL-19481-21-AM is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 01, 2021 to January 31, 2022.

is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or

February 14, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.

also pay to the Landlord
$60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 15, 2022

eviction may be enforced.
