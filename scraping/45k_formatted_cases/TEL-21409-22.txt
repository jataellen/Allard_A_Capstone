Helen Frangos


Tenant



 
 
 
Canadian Mental
Health Association (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Helen Frangos (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on January 19, 2022 with respect to application
TEL-19618-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the
Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: On January 12, 17 and 20, 2022 , the Tenant interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the unit for the Tenant in unit #35 by
using profanity while passing her within the common areas of the residential
complex.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.
