Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23185-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


394 RAVINEVIEW WAY OAKVILLE ON L6H6S7


 




Between:


Mei Xue


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Anastasia Ndukwe Louis Ogugua
Ndukwe


Tenants



 
 
Mei Xue (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Louis
Ogugua Ndukwe and Anastasia Ndukwe (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 13, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
represented by Jeff Meng, attended
the hearing. The Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing despite being served with the notice of
hearing
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
The rent is due on the first day of each
month.
 
3.    
On June 23, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenants an N8 Notice of Termination pursuant to subsection
58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Notice was served
by mail and therefore the effective date for service
would be deemed to be June 28, 2021 (5 days after
mailing). The notice provided a
termination date of August 31, 2021.
 
4.    
This was a fixed term tenancy
from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 and a month-to- month tenancy starting March 1,
2021.
 
5.    
Between January
2021 to June 2021 the Tenant paid rent late every month for a total of 6
months.
 
6.    
At the hearing, the Landlords representative indicated that the Tenants had paid the July
rent on June 30th, but aside from that one exception they continue to pay rent
late and have accumulated substantial arrears.




 
7.    
The Landlord requested
termination of the Tenancy for persistent late payment of rent because it puts
the Landlord in a constant state of financial strain and he indicated that the Tenants
are not paying because they tell him they are saving up for their own house.
 
8.    
Based on the uncontradicted evidence of the Landlord, I find that the Tenants
have persistently paid rent late.
 
9.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $3,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
10.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from March 14, 2020 to August 31, 2021
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated, as of January
22, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $10,450.81, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from September 1, 2021 to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit and less any payments the Tenants have paid towards this amount.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $101.92
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 12, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 22, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
