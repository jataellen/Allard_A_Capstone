In the matter
of:


1107, 25 TINDALE
COURT HAMILTON ON L8K6C8


 




Between:


Interrent C/o CLV
Group


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Alden Vandenkieboom Chelsea Vandenkieboom


 
Tenants



 
 
Interrent C/o CLV Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Alden Vandenkieboom and Chelsea Vandenkieboom
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Elena Jacob, attended
the hearing. As of 2:38 p.m.
the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 10, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,678.09.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $3,528.50 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord sent an
email to the Tenants on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,641.97 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 4, 2018 to December
31, 2020.




 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until January 29, 2022 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. Additional time given to the Tenants to pay the
outstanding amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $1,664.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $55.17 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 29, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January 30, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 30, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,017.95** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 30, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
