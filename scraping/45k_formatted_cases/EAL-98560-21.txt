Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-98560-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
71 CRESTWAY DRIVE OTTAWA ON K2G6T4


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Billy Chan


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Billy Chan (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlords’ representative, Allan
Kouri, attended the hearing. As of 2:28 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective January
31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is
$1,365.27.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $0.02 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: EAL-98560-21
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $5,856.62*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $44.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 8, 2022, then starting February
9, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)               
$6,042.62 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,407.89 if the payment
is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by
the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
