Mario Miotti


Tenant



 
2-8 St. Thomas Street
Holdings Inc. c/o Bentallgreenoak (Canada) LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mario Miotti (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
12, 2021.
 
A Landlord’s Agent, the Landlord's Legal Representative
Martin Zarnett, the Tenant and Tenant's
Legal Representative Samuel Mason attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The issue in the application filed is the Tenant has a history
of persistently failing
to pay the rent in full and
on the date it was due.
 
2.     On June 30, 2021, the Landlord
sent the Tenant an N8 Notice of Termination
alleging that the Tenant has been persistently late with the rent payments
payable to the Landlord.
 
3.    
This notice was issued
pursuant to paragraph 58(1)(a) of the Act which says:
58 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following
grounds:
1. The tenant has persistently failed
to pay rent on the date it becomes due and payable.
 
4.     It was undisputed that the month lawful rent is
$1,709.93 and rent is due on the 1st day of
the month.
 
5.     The Landlord’s Representative submitted a rent payment
ledger documenting that the Tenant has an extended history
of paying the monthly rent persistently late and in partial
payments dating back to January 2020.




 
 
 
6.    
The Tenant did not dispute that
rent has not always been paid in full and on time. The Tenant testified
that payments have been late for varied
reasons. Prior to January 2020 rent was paid direct by
interact/etransfer and then by personal cheque sent monthly to the Landlord.
7.    
The Tenant's Legal Representative
raised a preliminary issue that a rent arrears application TSL-19338-20 had been previously heard on June 23, 2021 and was resolved
by a consent order dated June 30, 2021, and the set out repayment schedule in
that order effectively directs the
payment of future rent in full and on time.
 
8.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative
acknowledged that there was a previous order issued by the Board but cited the Landlord’s right to file this L2 application for separate
cause of action and behaviour.
9.    
Based on the testimony and
submissions made by both the representatives for the Landlord and the Tenant,
I was satisfied that this application does not meet the elements of res judicata to preclude the
hearing of the merits of the Landlord’s application.
 
10.  Despite the fact that the rent payment
ledger submitted documenting that the Tenant has an extended history of paying
the monthly rent persistently late and trailing payments dating back to January
2020 it was unclear whether the Tenant’s behaviour persisted after the order
TSL-19338-20 was issued.
 
11. 
The ledger recorded late payments, yet the Tenant asserts that a series
of post-dated cheques were
directly given to the Landlord for the rent payments and arrears installments
all dated for the 1st as ordered in TSL-19338-20.
 
12.  All in all, the Landlord is not seeking to end the
tenancy but rather a conditional order for the
Tenant to pay their full lawful rent on time. The Tenant acknowledged his obligation to pay his full lawful rent on time.
13.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
14.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
the current lawful
monthly rent of $1,709.93 in full and on
time, on or before the 1st day of each month for the next 12-month period
commencing November 1, 2021 through to and including October 1, 2022.




 
2.    
If the Tenant fails to make any
one of the payments in paragraph 1 above, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without
notice to the Tenant
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a
payment.
