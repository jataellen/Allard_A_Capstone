904, 355
RATHBURN ROAD EAST MISSISSAUGA ON L4Z1H4


 




Between:

Tenants




 


and


 




 


Mary Godlewski


Landlord



 
 
 
Kenneth Mcknight and Lesley
Swam (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Mary Godlewski
(the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022.
 
The Tenant, Lesley Swan,
on behalf of the Tenants
and the Landlord’s Agent, Anthony
Godlewski, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     As a preliminary issue the Tenant’s
name was amended
as shown above.
 
2.     The Landlord collected rent in excess
of the amount allowed by the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') I say this for the reasons
that follow.
 
3.     It is uncontested that the Tenant moved into the rental
unit July 1, 2018, and vacated May 31, 2021; the last month rent deposit
went to rent for the month of May 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant testified
that the Landlord
charged her illegal
rent when her rent was raised
January 1, 2020 from $1,550.00 to $1,775.00 per month. Copies of the cashed
rental cheques were entered
into evidence. The Tenant is seeking the difference between
the lawful and illegal rent, $225.00, for January through May 2021 for a
total of $900.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s Agent did not dispute
the Tenant’s testimony; he requested time to pay the amount owing.
 
6.     This application is based on section 134(c)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’) which forbids Landlords
from charging more than the lawful rent.

7.    
Based on the undisputed evidence
and testimony, I find the Landlord
charged the Tenant illegal rent when it was increased from $1,550.00 to
$1,775.00 on January 1, 2020 contrary to section
134(c) of the Act in an amount
totalling $900.00. An order will issue for same.
 
8.     As the Tenants
were successful in the application, the Tenants are entitled to the
application filing fee.
 
9.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
the sum of $900.00. This amount represents
$900.00 in excess rent.
 
2.    
The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants
$53.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenants is $953.00.
 
4.    
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by June 21, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from June 22, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
5.     The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
