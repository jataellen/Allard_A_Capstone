Jamie Stokes Roy Schnieder


Tenants




 
 
 
Mindy Campeau (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Roy Schnieder and Jamie Stokes
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord
and the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Lorrie McCullough, attended the hearing. As of 10 a.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective May 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
December 23, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     On December 23, 2021, there was a fire to the rental
unit resulting in major structural damage making the rental unit uninhabitable.
At that time the unit was deemed uninhabitable and the tenancy agreement became
frustrated pursuant to the Frustrated Contracts Act and as permitted under
section 19 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA).
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,395.00.
 
5.     Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,395.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: EAL-95638-21
 
6.    
The Landlord has paid interest on the last month's rent deposit. As a result,
the Landlord does not owe any
further interest on the last month's rent deposit.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $5,580.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of
December 23, 2021 by operation
of section 19 of the RTA.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,844.78*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
23, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
