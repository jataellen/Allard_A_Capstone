Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-06558-18










 
 

DA
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JB
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of
the rental unit, and the purchaser requires vacant possession of the rental
unit for residential purposes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 26, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Landlord’s Form N12 notice of termination for the purchaser’s own residential
use of the rental unit does not comply with the requirements of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  
 
2.      Subsection
49(3) of the Act requires that the date of termination in a notice to terminate
a tenancy for a purchaser’s use be the last day of the tenancy period.  In this
case, the Landlord identified the first day of the tenancy period as the
termination date.
 
3.      The
Landlord’s Form N12 notice of termination is therefore void.
 
4.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 19, 2018 to August 18, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 1, 2018.
 
5.      At
the hearing, the Tenant agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s
rental arrears for the period ending July 31, 2018.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction, and postpone
the eviction date to September 30, 2018, subject to  the condition(s) set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
 
7.      This
was a difficult proceeding over which to preside.  The simple truth is that
both the Landlord and the Tenant are experiencing personal financial
difficulty.  
 
8.      The
Landlord has invested his life’s savings into purchasing the rental unit, and
relies on rental income to pay the mortgage and other costs associated with the
unit.  The Landlord also testified that the rental income is the Landlord’s
primary source of income.
 
9.      The
Tenant is also enduring financial hardship.  
 
10.   The
Tenant and her young child are survivors of domestic violence.  Because of the
trauma the Tenant experienced, the Tenant is currently unable to earn
employment income.  Instead, the Tenant receives income support benefits under
the Ontario Disability Support Program (‘ODSP’).
 
11.   It
is evident that the rental unit’s affordability is an issue in this case.
 
12.   The
Tenant testified that she intends to vacate the rental unit on or before
September 30, 2018.  The Landlord testified at the hearing that he does not
oppose terminating the tenancy on September 30, 2018.  The tenancy shall
therefore be terminated on that date.
 
13.   However,
I accept the Landlord’s evidence of the hardship he will continue to experience
because of the Tenant’s rental arrears.  
 
14.   At
the hearing, the Tenant testified that she is able to pay two months’ rent to
the Landlord to reduce the amount that she owes.  Under the circumstances, I
find it is not unfair to order the Tenant to pay two months’ rent, or
$3,050.00, to the Landlord within 11 days.  If the Tenant does not make this
payment in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act
to terminate the tenancy before September 30, 2018.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before September 30, 2018.
 
2.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 30, 2018, then starting October
1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 1,
2018.
 
4.      The
Tenant owes the Landlord $4,905.18*, which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to August 7, 2018.
 
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.14 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting August 8, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
6.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
7.      The
Tenant shall pay $3,050.00 of the total combined amounts set out in paragraphs
four, five and six, above, to the Landlord on or before August 18, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant does not comply with paragraph seven, above, the Landlord may
collect the entire outstanding balance from the combined amounts set out in
paragraphs four, five and six, immediately.
 
9.      If
the Tenant does not comply with paragraph seven, above, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without notice to
the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and
requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears and NSF fees and related charges
that become owing after August 18, 2018.
 
10.   If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full combined amounts owing in
paragraphs four, five and six on or before September 30, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from October 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
