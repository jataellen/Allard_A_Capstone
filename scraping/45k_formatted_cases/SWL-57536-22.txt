In the matter of:       UNIT A4, 40 EUCLID AVENUE

Keirsten Greathouse Nicholas Aaron
Lortie


Tenants




 
 
On January 7, 2022, Jian Ma (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicholas
Aaron Lortie and Keirsten Greathouse (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord and the Tenants signed
an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy
form, agreeing to terminate the tenancy effective April 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before April 1, 2022.
 
2.       
Since the Landlord filed this L3
application before the termination date to secure their position (rather than
after the termination date if the Tenants had failed to vacate), the costs of the application filing fee shall
not be ordered to be reimbursed by the Tenants.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 1,
2022, then starting April 2, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 2, 2022.

has not been filed on or before
this date with the
