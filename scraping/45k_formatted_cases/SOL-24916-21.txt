Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24916-21
 



In the matter
of:


#1, 57 WEST
AVENUE N HAMILTON ON L8L5C1


 




Between:


David Gambrell


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Beverly Ricard Darrin Sherrard


Tenants



 
 
 
David Gambrell (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Beverly Ricard and Darrin Sherrard (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
11, 2022. The Landlord
and one of the Tenants, Darrin
Sherrard, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,550.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,550.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 29, 2020 to
September 22, 2021.
 
7.     It is uncontested the total rent arrears owing to the Landlord by the Tenants
to January 31, 2022 is
$7750.00.
 
8.     The Tenant stated
the other Tenant
had vacated the rental unit approximately 3 weeks
ago and he did not know if she would be returning. He requested the Board grant relief




 
and impose a repayment plan that would preserve the tenancy and allow him to gradually pay the rent owing. He said he
had lost his job but just began working again. He intends to move in with his
family if the repayment plan is not granted.
 
9.    
In assessing the Tenant’s
employment and income,
I find it more probable
than not the Tenant would not be able to pay the
rent and the additional money towards arrears he proposed.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the Tenant’s
personal and financial circumstances and the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,531.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$50.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 29,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 28, 2022, then starting
January 29, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $7,936.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January




 
29, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
