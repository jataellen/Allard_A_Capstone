Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23956-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4022 FOURTH LINE OAKVILLE ON L6M4L4


 




Between:


George Bekiaris


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth Orr Fred Sinnett


Tenants



 
 
George Bekiaris (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Elizabeth Orr and
Fred Sinnett (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
intends to demolish the rental
unit; and because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on November 10, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative P Balatidis attended the hearing. The Tenant did not attend the hearing
although properly served with notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Form N13
 
1.    The Landlord served the
Tenants with a Form N13 seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of
demolishing the rental unit, in accordance with section 50(1)(a) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
2.    The property is a
single-family dwelling. The
Landlord’s Form N13 was served by mail on July 28, 2021 and contains a
termination date of December 31, 2021. The
Landlord testified that the Tenant was notified that the month of September
2021 would be abated in satisfaction of the one month’s rent
compensation.
 
3.   
I am satisfied that the Landlord
has met the 120 day notice requirement of s.50(2) of the Act, the end of period
termination requirement of s.50(2) of the Act, and the one month’s compensation
requirement of s. 52(2) of the Act.
 
4.   
I also find the Landlord intends
in good faith to carry out the demolition activity.




 
 
 
5.   
The
Landlord advised that the rental unit has deteriorated so much that it is past
the point of repair and must be demolished. The property has structural issues
and the Landlord produced an inspection report which substantiates the present,
deteriorated condition of the property. The Landlord
submitted he is well into
the process of applying for a
building permit, and as further evidence of his intent to move forward with the
demolition, he produced a letter dated October 8, 2021 from the Town of
Oakville, with a resolution that the property “be removed from the Oakville
Register of Properties of Cultural Heritage Value or Interest”
 
Form N8
 
6.    The Landlord also served the Tenant with a
Form N8, for persistently late payments. However, given my findings on the Form
N13 portion of the Landlord’s application, I need not consider those grounds.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
January 22, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$343.53, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from January 1, 2022
to January 11, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $31.23
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 12, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 22, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
