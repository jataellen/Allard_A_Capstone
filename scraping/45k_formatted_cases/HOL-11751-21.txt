Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11751-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2336 EQUESTRIAN CRESCENT OSHAWA ON L1L0L6


 




Between:


Kiruba Sivasubramaniam
  Ram Sivasubramaniam


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Alyshya Falls Steven Wolosewich


Tenants



 
 
 
Kiruba Sivasubramaniam and Ram
Sivasubramaniam (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Steven Wolosewich and Alyshya Falls (the 'Tenants') because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.
; because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 18, 2022. The Landlords
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants testified
that the email the Landlords sent on June 30, 2021 did not include
a copy of the notice to terminate
the tenancy. They testified that they
did not receive the notice until the middle of July. The termination date on the notice was
August 31, 2021. This did not provide the required 60 days notice. Email service is not an acceptable method of service under the Residential Tenancies Act. There is insufficient evidence to conclude
the Tenants were properly served.
 
2.    
The Tenants also testified that
the Landlord had not paid the one-month rent compensation by the termination date on the notice. The Landlord confirmed
the money has not been paid as
required under the Act.
 
3.     I find the Landlord
has not properly served the notice on the Tenants and has not paid the required compensation.




File Number: HOL-11751-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
