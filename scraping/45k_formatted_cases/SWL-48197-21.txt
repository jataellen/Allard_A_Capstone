Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-48197-21
 



In the matter
of:


167 PRICE STREET LONDON ON N5Z2J6


 




Between:


Tomasz Janiak


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sherry Hockey


Tenant



 
 
Tomasz Janiak (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sherry Hockey (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant because the Landlord has entered into an agreement
of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation (L2 application).
 
This application was heard via video conference on July 16, 2021 and January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, Ronald
Rybowski, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s friend, Robert Jackson attended
the July 2021 hearing.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, Ronald Rybowski and the Tenant’s
friend, Robert Jackson attended the January 2022
hearing.
 
It is noted that the Landlord
was present when attendance was taken at the beginning
of the hearing block, but the
Landlord left prior to the hearing.
 
Robert Jackson
consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the July 2021 hearing, it was determined that the
Landlord’s Form N4 Notice of Termination was not served properly
in accordance with the Rules,
and was therefore, defective.
 
2.     As such, the Landlord requested
that the L1 application be withdrawn.
 
3.     In accordance with subsection 200(4)
of the Act, I consent
to the withdrawal of the L1
application.




 
4.    
The hearing of the L2 application regarding Purchaser’s own use commenced
at the July 2021 hearing, but was not completed. The matter was
adjourned to a date to be scheduled by the Board.
 
5.    
On November 22, 2021, the Landlord
communicated to the Board that the property
has been sold and requested the withdrawal of the L1/L2 application.
 
6.     The Board issued an Endorsement that the Landlord
required the consent of the other party to withdraw
the application. In the alternative, the Landlord may make the request
before the Member at the hearing January 2022 hearing.
 
7.     The hearing commenced on January 19, 2022 and the Landlord
requested the consent
of the Board to withdraw the L1/L2 application.
 
8.     The Landlord submitted
that there has been a material change
in the circumstances after
the last hearing. Specifically, the Landlord has sold the property to a new
purchaser. To be clear, this is not the same purchaser as it relates to the Form N12 that was served on the Tenant.
Due to delays, the previous purchaser withdrew from the agreement of purchase
and sale. Subsequently, the Landlord sold the property to a new purchaser on
October 31, 2021.
 
9.     The Tenant’s representative opposed the withdrawal of
the application. The Tenant took the position that the application was brought in bad faith, the hearing
should continue and a finding made that the application be
dismissed.
 
10.  As I stated at the hearing, the Landlord is correct that if the hearing continued, the Board would have
to dismiss the application as this is not the same purchaser as when the Form
N12 was served.
 
11.  It would be a waste of the Board’s resources to continue to hear this application given the
circumstances. In addition, the Board will not force an applicant to litigate a
matter they want to withdraw.
 
12.  At the hearing,
I consented to the withdrawal of the Landlord’s L2 application.
 
13.  The Landlord requested costs, which was denied. As I stated
at the hearing, I am not of the view that the Tenant’s conduct was
unreasonable by not consenting to the withdrawal, prior to the hearing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's L1/L2
application is dismissed
as withdrawn.
