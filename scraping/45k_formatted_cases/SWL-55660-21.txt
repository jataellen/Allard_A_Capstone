In the
  matter of:


1007, 10 HIGHLAND CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2M5C2


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dragon Sladoje


Tenant



 
Starlight Canadian Residential
Growth (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dragon Sladoje (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, John Edlund, attended
the hearing. As of 10:11 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $930.02.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $777.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 2, 2022.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,821.46*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
28, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.58 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)             
$4,859.02 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2022, or
ii)           
$5,789.04 if the payment is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 9, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
