Review Order
 
RWC Management
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Emily Gibbons and Nathaniel Maltese
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order SOL-18109-20 issued on October
5, 2021.
 
On October 20, 2021, the
Tenants requested a review of the order because they were not reasonably able to participate in the
hearing.
 
On October 22, 2021, interim order SOL-18109-20-RV-IN was issued staying
order SOL-18109- 20 issued on
October 5, 2021.
 
The request was heard by way of
video conference January 7, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Ibifiri
Fabian and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Tenants declined
to speak to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenants’ Request to Review
 
1.       
For the following reasons,
I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing held on September 7,
2021.
 
2.       
The Tenant, Emily Gibbons (‘EG’)
testified that she never received the Board’s Notice of Hearing and because of
this, she was unable to reasonably participate in the hearing. EG testified
that the Landlord failed to name her as a Tenant on the N4 Notice of
Termination and the L1 application. Because of this error, she never received
the Notice




 
of Hearing. Further, the other
named Tenant, Nathaniel Maltese (‘NM’) is the one who received the Notice of Hearing but moved out of the rental
unit. He did tell
her about the hearing date but gave her the wrong
date to attend. EG further submitted
that on the morning of the hearing, she had a medical emergency and her phone
was stolen which further impaired her ability to participate in the hearing.
 
3.       
The Landlord’s Representative confirmed that EG was not named
on the N4 notice or the
L1 application. She said this was an
error on the part of the Landlord and that she was not aware until September
2021 that EG was in fact a Tenant. The
Landlord’s Representative confirmed that EG is on the tenancy agreement and
listed as a tenant.
 
4.       
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that once she learned EG was a tenant and that NM moved out of the
rental unit sometime in August 2021, she started communicating with EG. On September 1, 2021, she sent EG a text message confirming the hearing date. The Landlord’s Representative further submitted that she reminded
EG of the date on the morning of the hearing but EG did not respond
until 7:08 pm. EG told the Landlord’s Representative that she was not at the
hearing because she was in an ambulance in the morning and then her phone was
stolen.
 
Findings
 
5.       
I am satisfied on a balance of
probabilities that the EG was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
In making this finding, I considered the undisputed evidence
of the Tenant that she was
never sent a Notice
of Hearing because she was not listed
as a Tenant on the N4 notice
or in the Landlord’s L1 application. Further, the named Tenant, NM moved out of
the rental unit and provided EG with the incorrect hearing date. I also considered that undisputed evidence
that once the Tenant learned of the hearing, a medical emergency prevented her
from attending. Given these circumstances, I find it reasonable and just to grant the Tenants’ request to
review on the grounds that EG was not reasonably able to participate in the
hearing on September 7, 2021.
 
New Hearing of Landlord’s L application
 
6.       
Given the error in the N4 notice
and the L1 application, the Landlord’s Representative sought the consent of the Board to withdraw
the application. I consented to this request.
 
7.       
The Landlord’s application is withdrawn without
prejudice and the Board’s file is closed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenants’ request to review is granted.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
