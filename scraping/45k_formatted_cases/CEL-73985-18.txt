Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 
 
 

The Tenant, MFA, applied for an order determining that
the Landlord, TB, deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlord
is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement
and harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant
(T2 application- CET-72638-18).
The day prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Landlord filed an L1 application to terminate the
tenancy and to evict the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes (L1 application- CEL-73985-18).
 
The Tenant acknowledged that he did not pay the rent he
was required to pay for the period from January 1,
2018 to February 28, 2018. Accordingly and with the consent of the
parties, these applications were heard together in Mississauga on March 1,
2018.
 
The Tenant also acknowledged that
he incorrectly included TCH as a Landlord in his application. At the hearing THC
was deleted as a Landlord party.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
spouse and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     
The monthly rent is $650.00.
The Tenant has not paid the total rent of $1,300.00 he was required to pay for
the period January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2018. 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2016 to February 28,
2018.
Inadequate Heat
4.     
The rental unit is a studio
apartment. The Tenant stated that throughout the winter of 2016-2017 his rental
unit was cold. However, he did not dispute that the first complaint he made to
the Landlord about the inadequacy of heat was on October 1, 2017 when he sent a
text message to the landlord stating: “I spent last winter without heat. I will
appreciate if you do something about that this year.” Based on the response
from the Landlord, it would appear this complaint came as a surprise. He sent a
text message back to the Tenant stating: “What do you mean without heat.
There’s heat in there. I will get the woman upstairs to turn it up.” Indeed,
the Tenant acknowledged to the Landlord in one of his text messages on December
15, 2017 that he never complained about the heat not working during the winter
of 2016-2017, adding that he could not live with inadequate heat again this
year.
5.     
The Landlord said he
contacted the person who lived above the Tenant and she reported to the
Landlord that she was not experiencing a problem with the heat in her unit.
6.     
On November 10, 2017 the
Tenant followed up with the same complaint about inadequate heat. He sent a
text message to the Landlord asking the Landlord to do something about the heat
and complained that it is ridiculous that he has to wear a jacket to go to the
bathroom which is accessed through the hall entrance to the Tenant’s rental
unit. The Landlord promised to get O, the handyman who occupies a back
apartment in the premises, to investigate. The Landlord said that O checked the
rental unit in November and found no problem with the heat. However, the Tenant
said that all O did was to change the filters on the furnace, but that had made
no difference.
7.     
On December 15, 2017 the
Tenant repeated by text message to the Landlord that he still did not have
enough heat and that he was fed up. The Tenant also demanded that the Landlord
not send O to his door again because he does not know anything about heating,
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). He warned the Landlord that his next
step would be a complaint to the Landlord and Tenant Board. On December 16,
2017 the Tenant repeated his complaint by text message to the Landlord. 
8.     
Initially in his testimony, the
Landlord insisted there was no problem with the heat. He said O checked the
rental unit in November and December and found nothing to complain about. He
also said O had lived in the rental unit before the Tenant took occupancy and
had no problem. He claimed O told him he had to open a window in his back
apartment presumably because he found it too warm. O was not a witness at the
hearing. The Landlord suggested that the Tenant and O had a falling out that
resulted in the Tenant refusing to allow O to look at the rental unit. The
written evidence, however, does not support these assertions.
9.     
On the morning of December
18, 2017, the Tenant sent a text message to the Landlord stating that he got
home in time to meet the guy the Landlord sent to look into the heat issue. He
went on to write that that person has no knowledge of HVAC; rather, he does
renovations. At the hearing the Tenant said the person who attended then was
merely a handyman who talked just about fixing the front door. That day the
Tenant sent the Landlord a series of seven unanswered messages complaining
about being ignored and how unfairly he was being treated. 
10.  
On December 21, 2018, the
Tenant again warned by text message he would be taking proceedings against the
Landlord.
11.  
The Landlord stated he told
the Tenant he would call Winston to fix the heating problem but the Tenant
insisted on 48 hours’ notice to enter his rental unit. Indeed, he said the
Tenant always insisted on 48 hours’ notice.
12.  
At first, the Landlord stated
that Winston went to the rental unit three times but he was not allowed in and
each time the Landlord was charged $100. On further questioning, the Landlord
said that W was allowed to enter on the third occasion that he visited the
rental unit and that the Landlord was only charged $100 by W.
13.  
The Tenant’s version of what
happened at his rental unit differs, however, from the Landlord and has the
added advantage that it is memorialized in text messages made concurrently with
the events. On December 22, 2017 the Tenant complained by text message that he
had made himself available that morning but the Landlord cancelled the visit at
the last minute.
14.  
On December 23, 2017 the
Landlord sent a text message to the Tenant at 7:28 P.M. informing him that O
had arranged for a technician to attend the rental unit the next day between 10:00
A.M. and 12:00 P.M. The Tenant immediately responded that he had told O he was
not available. After some communication back and forth regarding why, among
other things, the Tenant refused to leave the rental unit open to a stranger,
the Tenant again agreed to wait for the technician, which he did. However, the
technician again failed to attend as arranged with the result that the Landlord
received a barrage of unanswered complaints from the Tenant.
15.  
On December 26, 2017 the
Landlord sent a text message to the Tenant offering to have the technician
visit his rental unit on December 30, 2017 at a time convenient to the Tenant
between 10:00 A.M. and midnight. They agreed on a time between 10:00 A.M. and
1:00 P.M. The Tenant said the technician attended and told him only one vent is
connected to the furnace and that to remedy the problem would be a big job
involving breaking through the drywall and removing and installing pipes.
16.  
On December 28, 2017 the
Landlord sent a text message to the Tenant telling him the problem with the
heat cannot be fixed until the weather changes, by which I took him to mean
when it became warmer. The Landlord also suggested in that text message that
the Tenant move out. At the hearing the Tenant stated that the Landlord had asked
the Tenant to let him lock up his place so that he could do the repair in the
summer. The Tenant said it was his understanding the Landlord had asked him to
find a new place to live.
17.  
However, the Landlord stated
he asked the tenant to move out for two days and stay in a room at his sister’s
place while the repairs were undertaken but the Tenant had refused. I prefer
the Tenant’s version of these communications for reasons I will set out later
in this judgment, however, I pause here to say that the Tenant’s alleged
refusal of an empty bedroom at the Landlord’s sister’s residence, I find, would
be a reasonable position to take. It would be asking too much of the Tenant to
expect him to experience the inconvenience of living in a room at a place with
total strangers because of a problem of the landlord’s own making.
18.  
The Landlord stated that he
did not want to undertake the repair of the heating problem while the Tenant
resided in the rental unit because it would not be in the best interest of the
Tenant to endure a mess and significant dust. One would expect this reasoning
would come from the Tenant rather than the Landlord. More importantly, the
Landlord told the Tenant in writing he would not be undertaking the needed
repairs until the warmer weather arrived which is consistent with the Landlord
intending to do nothing to rectify the inadequate heat in the rental unit in
the coming winter months rather than remedying the problem in two days. Accordingly
and having regard to the Tenant’s insistence he not have to live without
adequate heat, it is likely the Landlord was inviting the Tenant to leave the
rental unit permanently.
19.  
The undisputed evidence was that
at the end of December 2017 the Landlord’s spouse and the Tenant spoke on the
telephone and she then dropped off the two portable heaters she had bought.
Thereafter the Tenant looked for a new place to rent which he has found and has
taken possession of it on March 1, 2018.
20.  
The Landlord explained that
in September 2015 he had the baseboard heaters removed from the rental unit and
had a family member, who had earlier installed the furnace, connect a new vent
to the furnace. It is also not disputed that only one vent was actually connected
to the furnace and that the repair to connect all of the vents would be a major
undertaking.  
21.  
Thus, I find the Landlord
failed to provide to the rental unit adequate heat, which is an essential
service the Landlord is obliged to provide.
22.   Section 21 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006, (the ‘Act’) provides:

21 (1) A landlord shall not at any time
during a tenant’s occupancy of a rental unit and before the day on which an
order evicting the tenant is executed, withhold the reasonable supply of any
vital service, care service or food that it is the landlord’s obligation to
supply under the tenancy agreement or deliberately interfere with the
reasonable supply of any vital service, care service or food.
23.   In Onyskiw v CJM
Property Management Ltd,[1] the often referred to
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal on the landlord’s duty to maintain
rental premises, a six-story building had its single elevator out of service
for 96 days over four periods of time. The parties agreed that the landlord acted
reasonably throughout to deal with the elevator problems. Nevertheless, the
tenants sought an abatement of rent for the periods the elevator was not
operational. Applying a contextual analysis, the Ontario Court of Appeal denied
the Tenants’ claims. 
24.   The present case,
however, is much different from the situation dealt with by the courts in Onyskiw.
In this case it cannot be said the Landlord had an effective program of
preventative maintenance and addressed the problem in a reasonable and timely
manner. The rental unit lacked an adequate heating system when the tenancy
began. Judging by later inspection, this deficiency likely would have been
known to the Landlord had he engaged in a reasonable inspection before the
Tenant took occupancy of the rental unit. Because the Tenant did not complain
until October 2017, I find the Tenant was unnecessarily exposed to inadequate
heat for a period of approximately four months due to the Landlord’s failure to
provide and maintain the heating system in the rental unit in a good state of
repair.
25.   The Tenant is entitled
to a lump sum abatement of rent equal to 25% of the monthly rent for four
months which totals $650.00 for the lack of an adequate heating system, though I recognize there were
some warm days in the early part of that period and that eventually heaters
were provided, one of which sat on the floor in the hallway. Also, in
determining this amount, I have taken into consideration the impact on the
Tenant and I have considered that despite the inadequate temperature in the
rental unit, the Tenant was still able to live in the unit and he should pay
some rent for the services and facilities he continued to receive. 
26.  
The Tenant is also entitled
to $50.00 for the application filing fee the Tenant incurred. 
27.  
The $650.00 rent abatement
and the $50.00 filing fee are deducted from the undisputed rent arrears that
the Tenant owes the Landlord.
28.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be necessary to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant
has already moved out of the rental unit.
Harassment, Obstruction, Coercion, Threatening
or Interference with the Tenant
29.    While there is no definition of “harassment” in the
RTA, it is generally held that “harassment” is a course of conduct that a
reasonable person knows or ought to know would be unwelcome.
30.   The Tenant’s text
messages to the Landlord were critical of the Landlord’s delay in responding to
him and there was an occasion on December 28, 2017 on the telephone when the conversation became heated
resulting in the landlord hanging up on the Tenant. The Landlord wanted it
understood that delays in responding to the Tenant’s text messages were due to
him having gone to Florida from January 3, 2018 to January 6th and
from there he went on to Jamaica where, he said, internet service was poor and
expensive. He returned to Ontario on January 18, 2018.I note, however, the
delays that the Tenant complained about in his text messages occurred before
the Landlord left Canada. 
31.   I find the gist of the Landlord’s behaviour that the Tenant
has complained about is essentially grounded on the Landlord’s lack of
professionalism, by which I took the Tenant to mean his unreasonableness. That
behaviour is so entwined in the failure to provide adequate heat that granting
relief for harassment, I find, would amount to double recovery which I am not
prepared to award. 
32.   In addition, I am not satisfied the communications or lack
thereof on the part of the Landlord rise to the level of constituting
harassment or any of the other forms of inappropriate conduct listed in the T2
application. At the hearing which took place on the morning of March 1, 2018,
the Tenant returned the keys to the rental unit to the Landlord. The Landlord
requested to terminate the tenancy in his L1 application. The tenancy is
terminated as of February 28, 2018.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of February 28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $89.56*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up
to February 28, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenant.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 16, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March
17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
