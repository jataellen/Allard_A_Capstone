Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04503-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 9 TIMBERWOLF ROAD BRAMPTON ON L6P2B4


 




Between:


Kam Ramdas


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rose Osasere Amure


Tenant



 
 
Kam Ramdas (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rose Osasere Amure
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on November 15, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-01868-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant
failed to pay the arrears
installment as well as the lawful monthly
rent on or before
December 8, 2021 as prescribed in the Order.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $7,686.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-01868-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $7,686.00 and that amount is included in this order.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to February 14, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-01868-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant
must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,324.40* (less any amount paid to the Landlords
after this application was filed on December 24, 2021). This amount represents the rent owing up to February
14, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.

The tenant has until February 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files
the motion by February 24, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 26, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
