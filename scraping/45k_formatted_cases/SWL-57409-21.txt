Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57409-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN FLOOR,
10 HARRIS STREET TILLSONBURG ON N4G2B2


 




Between:


Adham Halabi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kelly Coghlan


Tenant



 
 
 
Adham Halabi (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kelly Coghlan (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 5, 2021 with respect to application
SWL-50716-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1350.00 rent on or
before November 30, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$3,436.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-50716-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,636.00
and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-50716-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-57409-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2019 to January 13, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-50716-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,981.85*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 13, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
