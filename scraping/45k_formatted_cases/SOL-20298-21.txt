In the matter of:      38 MILLWOOD PLACE

Jacques Bouchard Nicole Quesnel


Tenants




 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nicole Quesnel
and Jacques Bouchard
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sharon
Churcher, attended the hearing. As of 10:21 a.m.,
the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective December 24, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,140.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $1,100.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $12,625.43*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $37.48
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $13,261.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
