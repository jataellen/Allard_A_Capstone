File Number: EAL-97528-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


303, 67 CARTIER
STREET OTTAWA ON K2P1J6


 




Between:


Saickley Enterprises Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hans (Erik) Kanstrup


Tenant



 
 
 
Saickley
Enterprises Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Hans (Erik) Kanstrup
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on August 31, 2021 with respect to application EAL-93597-21.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 3, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s agents, N. Cutler and D. Saucier,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
filed an L4 application for breach of order EAL-93597-21, because on June 28, 2021, the Landlord received
complaints about an aggressive argument, with loud yelling and screaming, that
involved the Tenant. The Landlord
also alleged that the Tenant was seen arguing with a guest in the basement and
in the parking garage, thereby breaching paragraph 1 of the order EAL-93597-21,
issued on August 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The matter
was sent to a hearing
because the alleged
breach occurred on June 28, 2021, before the order was issued, and on
the same day as the hearing was held that had resulted in the consent order.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s
witnesses said that the hearing on June 28, 2021, was held in the morning, and
the alleged breach occurred in the afternoon, after the hearing. They said that the police were called to the residential complex, and they were present
at 9 p.m. on June 28,
2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s witnesses said that since June 28, 2021,
there have been further
breaches of the consent order.




 
5.    
The Landlord’s
witnesses entered into evidence emails received from tenants of the residential
complex in which they complain of loud noises late at night coming from the
Tenant’s rental unit on July 27, 2021, and loud yelling and arguing in the
middle of the night on July 28, 2021. There are also complaints about aggressive arguments
in which violence is
threatened.
 
6.     The Landlord’s witnesses said that in the week prior to the hearing
on December 3, 2021,
there were complaints about yelling, swearing and cursing by the Tenant in the
rental unit, and at least three tenants reported about the incident to the
Landlord.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s
witnesses said that there have been at least three incidents of disturbances by the Tenant
that have involved
the police since the end of July, 2021.
 
8.    
The Landlord
is seeking eviction. The Landlord’s witnesses
said that they have received complaints about repeated
disturbances to neighbouring units, tenants telling them that they are fearful
of moving around the building, and tenants telling them that they feel unsafe
when the police are constantly on the residential complex.
 
9.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain
conditions specified in the
order.
 
10.  I find that the Landlord has proved, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant has breached
the consent order EAL-93597-21, issued
on August 31, 2021. In that order,
the Tenant agreed not to have loud arguments, create disturbances or
make excessive noise. The Landlord had evidence that the Tenant
immediately breached the consent order, on the very same day, later in the day,
as the hearing had been held. The
Landlord provided ample evidence of further complaints by residents of the
residential complex, and sent to the Landlord’s employees, about the Tenant and
his guests having loud arguments, threatening violence, and creating
disturbances that have led to police presence on the residential complex. There have been multiple incidents that
are ongoing to the date of this hearing.
 
11.  Consequently, I find that the Tenant has
not met the following conditions specified in the order, in paragraph 1: There shall be no incident that would
give rise to the Landlord serving another Notice of Termination (N5) based on
similar reasons set out in the 2 N5s filed with the application. The issue may include
but is not limited to: excessive noise, disturbances or loud
arguments from the Tenant or his guest(s) in the residential complex.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-93597-21, issued on August 31, 2021, is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.




 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
