In the matter of:      A, 310 FELIX STREET
CORNWALL, ON K6H 5A6
 
Between:                  Brock McBride                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Spencer Chase                                                                                                                       Tenant
 
 
On January
3, 2022, Brock McBride (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Spencer
Chase (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous L1 application EAL-97212-21 was already
decided at a hearing
heard November 23, 2021 which only the Landlord attended and which the Tenant
failed to attend.
 
2.       
The Landlord was successful at the
hearing and obtained a hearing order issued on December 3, 2021 which ordered 2
options for the Tenant: (1) move out by December 14, 2021 or get evicted, plus
pay rent arrears of $2,200.74 plus $186.00 filing fee to the Landlord, plus pay
the Landlord daily compensation of $17.92
for each day the Tenant stays in the rental
unit beyond December 4, 2021
until the Tenant actually moves out or gets evicted; or (2) void the eviction
order and continue in the tenancy by paying $3,456 to the Landlord or the Board
in trust if paid by December 14, 2021 (which would pay off all arrears and
costs owing so that the Tenant’s ledger with the Landlord would be brought down
to a zero balance).
 
3.       
The Landlord was not entitled to file this L4 application. An L4 application is only to be used
when there was NO EVICTION ordered at the hearing. An L4 application can be used when the Board issued a
conditional order where the tenancy was preserved
and a repayment plan was issued, or if the parties came to
a consent agreement
where the tenancy
was preserved but a repayment plan was made. If a conditional order had been issued instead,
the Landlord’s recourse for the Tenant failing to meet the payment plan terms
would have been to apply in an L4
application seeking eviction.
 
4.       
Since the L1 application in file
number EAL-97212-21 was resolved by a hearing,
and since the hearing Member
already ordered eviction
as one of the




options, this is not the appropriate circumstance for the Landlord to file an L4
application.
 
5.       
The Landlord stated in the Declaration to the L4 application that the Tenant was required to pay $3,456.00
but failed to pay it or speak to the Landlord. Payment of $3,456 by December 14, 2021 was
only one of the options if the Tenant had chosen to void the eviction
order. Since the Tenant did not pay to void the
order by the deadline of December 14, 2021, the Landlord’s only recourse
is to follow through with the eviction and attempt to collect the amounts owing
through other channels.
 
6.       
The Landlord and Tenant Board cannot enforce eviction orders or assist parties to obtain judgments owing. The Board simply adjudicates disputes between the parties as it did for the Landlord’s
L1 application, where eviction was ordered and rent arrears, filing fee cost,
and daily compensation were already ordered.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
7.       
The Landlord’s L4 application is dismissed since this was the wrong situation to file an L4 application.
 
8.       
The previous hearing order EAL-97212-21 issued on December
3, 2021 remains in effect.
