Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24214-21



In the matter
of:


UNIT 1, 426
ST. PAUL STREET ST CATHARINES ON L2R3N3


 




Between:


Yongchang Yu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Robert
Lavoie


 
Tenant



 
 
Yongchang Yu (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert
Lavoie (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. The Landlord, the Tenant,
and the Tenant’s Legal Representative, L. Ridsdill, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with a
Notice to End your Tenancy for Non-payment of Rent (N4) indicating the rent
was $750.00 in June and August 2021,
but $1,250.00 in July 2021. The rent changed in July
because the Tenant had guests.
 
2.    
I find the N4 notice defective because it does not correctly set out the amount of rent owing by the Tenant for the period
claimed, as required by subsection 59(2) of Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
The Board cannot issue an order terminating the tenancy without a valid notice
of termination.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
