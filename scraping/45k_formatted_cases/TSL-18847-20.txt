Tenants




 
 
 
Chung & Jao Developments
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marlene
Simone Carnevale and Giancarlo Carnevale (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by telephone/video-conference on December 2, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative Bryan Rubin attended
the hearing on behalf of the Landlord.
 
There was a Zoom video
participant with their username listed as “Giancarlo”; however, their audio was never turned on. For brief periods
the video seemed to be working
which showed a man on the screen, but for most of the
hearing block the video was turned off.
 
Despite repeated instructions
from 9am to 11:30am for the Tenants to attempt to unmute themselves, and despite repeated
announcements providing the dial-in telephone
number with the PIN# for this
conference line, whoever called in using Zoom video with the username
“Giancarlo” never unmuted themselves, and there was no dial-in from the
Tenants.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative relayed that the Tenants had engaged in similar behaviour before at the June 9, 2021 hearing which was adjourned. He suggested the tactic of choosing not to speak at all during sign-in was the
Tenants’ attempt to avoid the hearing.
 
Upon considering the factors in Rule
21.8 of the Board’s Rules of Procedure, I was satisfied that a
further adjournment would be prejudicial to the Landlord. There were
significant rent arrears alleged over 15 months with nothing paid. I was satisfied that the Notice of Hearing
was properly served upon the
Tenants as per the Board’s records (certificate signed by “Kelly N. mailing the
Notice of Hearing package to the Tenants on November 15, 2021). The Landlord’s
Legal Representative had also sent correspondence about the hearing and disclosure
to the Tenants




 
more than a week before the
hearing. Although a Zoom participant had named themselves “Giancarlo”, there
was never any verbal confirmation that the Tenants attended the hearing.
Despite waiting over 2 hours and announcing the phone number and PIN# for the hearing many times, no Tenants called in. As of
11:32am the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
given notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
Pursuant to section 7 of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. S.22 the hearing proceeded on an uncontested basis.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a N4 Notice of Termination with effective termination date
November 12, 2020.
 
2.       
I was satisfied based on the
Certificate of Service filed with the Board that the N4 Notice of Termination
was properly served on the Tenants by mail on October 23, 2020 with service effected
5 days thereafter. The N4 Notice of Termination complied
with section 59 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act) and was not voided by the Tenants.
 
3.       
The Tenants were in possession of
the rental unit when the L1 application was filed with the Board on November 16, 2020. The Tenants remained
in possession of the rental
unit as of the hearing date.
 
4.       
Monthly rent is $1,574.99 due on the first (1st) day of each month. Monthly
rent remained unchanged
during the duration of arrears claimed.
 
5.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.
 
6.       
The Tenants made no payments after the L1 application was filed but before the hearing.
 
7.       
I
am satisfied that the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment plan as per section 83(6) of the Act. The Landlord’s Legal Representative explained that there had been no communication from the Tenants at all
to any outreach made by the Landlord. A letter was submitted dated November 25,
2021 where the Tenants were asked to propose a payment plan for the Landlord’s
consideration.
 
8.       
The Landlord’s Legal Representative was not aware of any
circumstances regarding the Tenants
with respect to why I should delay or deny eviction. A standard eviction order
was requested based on the fact that over a year of consecutive monthly arrears
were being claimed, the Tenants had never communicated with the Landlord, and
there had been nothing paid since the N4. The Landlord was described as a corporate landlord but the
arrears had grown so large that the Landlord was having trouble operating the building.




 
9.       
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 23, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
Between the hearing date and the issuance date of this order, further
monthly rent has become due, which is included in the
calculations below. If the Tenants made any payments after the
hearing date, these amounts shall be deducted from the amounts ordered
below.
 
Pay and Go
Option
(see section A of the attached Schedule
1: Summary of Calculations)
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$24,254.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to the order issuance date, January 12, 2022.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $51.78 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022
to the date the Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the L1 application.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing of $24,440.63** on
or before January 23, 2022
(standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order), the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 24, 2022.
 
Pay and Stay Option
(see section B of the attached Schedule
1: Summary of Calculations)
 
9.       
If, on or before January 23, 2022,
the Tenants pay the amount of $25,385.70*** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that
the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit. If this




 
payment is not made in
full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
10.    The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this
order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after January 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
