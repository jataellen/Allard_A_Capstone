Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35054-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


5, 672 THE
QUEENSWAY S KESWICK ON
  L4P2G7


 




Between:


2065442 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kathleen Simiana


Tenant



 
 
 
2065442 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kathleen Simiana
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022.   The Landlord, Linley
Ho, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jacqueline Ho, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
December 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The parties contested the date the Tenant vacated
the rental unit. The Tenant
states she vacated the rental
unit on December 28, 2021, but that she did not communicate this to the
Landlord directly. She says she gave
the keys to her father to return to the Landlord and she does not know when
this occurred. The Landlord states
that she received the keys on January
3, 2022, but that she found a
note from the Tenant posted to the door to the rental unit on December 31, 2021 stating that the
Tenant would not return the keys until she was paid a certain amount of money.
I find this note to be sufficient indication that the Tenant vacated the rental
unit. As a result, I find that the Tenant vacated the rental unit on December
31, 2021.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,198.00.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,198.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: TNL-35054-21
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $3,250.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
December 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount
of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears
of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $245.71*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant: $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The net result
of the above is that the Landlord owes the Tenant
a balance of $59.71.
 
5.     The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant $59.71.
