Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55217-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4, 1302 HURON
STREET LONDON ON N5Y4M3


 




Between:


Richmond Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Soucie
  Terrel Glover


Tenants



 
 
 
Richmond
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Michael Soucie and Terrel Glover
(the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal representative, C. Sanford, attended the hearing. As of 12:30
p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants persistently failed
to pay rent when it was due. The Landlord served on the Tenants an N8 notice to
terminate on August 5, 2021.
 
2.    
Rent is due on the first of each month.
 
3.    
As per the N8 Notice, the Tenants had not paid rent in full by the first of the month twelve times in
twelve months.
 
4.     The Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,155.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August 21, 2019 to October 31, 2021.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




File Number: SWL-55217-21
 
grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the
Act.
 
7.    
The Landlord requested that the Tenants be ordered to pay the rent in full and on time for a period of 12 months, failing
which, the Landlord
could apply to the Board
to terminate the tenancy. I find this relief to be
appropriate in the circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
a)    
The Tenants shall pay the full
monthly rent on or before the first day of each month, commencing March 1, 2022
and for 12 months thereafter up to and including February 1, 2023.
 
2.   
If the Tenants fail to comply with
the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 1 of this order.
 
3.   
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application. ‘
