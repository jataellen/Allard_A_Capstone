2006


 




 


File Number:
NOL-44670-22




In the
matter of:


D108, 1290 BANCROFT DR SUDBURY ON P3B4E2


 




Between:


Three Seasons Investments Ltd


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Charles Wabegijik


Tenant



 
 
On December 31, 2021,
Three Seasons Investments Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Charles Wabegijik (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on July 22, 2021 with respect to application NOL-41909-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord $200.00
on or before December 3, 2021
towards arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$5,586.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order NOL-41909-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,786.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order NOL-41909-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from November
16, 2019 to January 19, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44670-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order NOL-41909-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,865.25*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.

The tenant has until January
29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with
section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 31, 2022 if the order has not
been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
