Review Order
 
Guylaine Parthenais (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order requiring Robert Johnston (‘RJ’) and Joelle Glaasroth (‘JG’) (the 'Tenants') to pay the rent that they owe. The Landlord
also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-30105-21 issued on November
15, 2021.
 
On November 24, 2021, the
Tenants requested a review of the order alleging they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing because
they did not receive the Notice of Hearing.
 
On December 6, 2021, the Board issued interim
order TNL-30105-21-RV-IN staying
the order issued on November
15, 2021.
 
The request
was heard by way of video conference on February 8, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
The Tenants declined
to speak to Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the commencement of
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s Request to Review
 
1.       
RJ testified that he never received
the Notice of Hearing by mail or email. He also did not
get a copy of the Landlord’s L9 application. RJ testified that he and JG moved out of
the rental unit on November 30, 2020 pursuant to the Landlord serving them an
N12 Notice of Termination. RJ
testified that he paid Canada Post for his mail to be forwarded to the new
address, but this service was only valid for 6 months. The Notice of Hearing was mailed to the rental unit more than 6
months after the Tenants vacated. RJ
said he and JG really wanted to attend the hearing because they had issues they
wanted to raise.




 
2.       
The Landlord testified that she had no evidence
as to whether the Tenants
were reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
 
3.       
I am satisfied on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the
Board hearing held on November 1, 2021. In
making this finding, I considered the fact the Tenants did their due diligence
to have their mail forwarded to their new address,
however the mail forwarding
was only valid for 6 months. This means,
at the time the Board mailed the Notice of Hearing to the Tenants at the renal
unit address, the mail forwarding expired and it would not have received it.
The Tenant’s request to review the order is granted.
 
New Hearing of the Landlord’s L9 Application
 
Preliminary Issues
 
4.       
The Tenants wanted to raise issues
with respect to an N12 Notice of Termination served to them by the Landlord which resulted in them moving
out of the rental unit in November 2020. The Tenants believe
the N12 Notice of Termination was invalid. The Tenants also wanted to raise maintenance issues. The evidence
provided by the Tenants with respect
to the maintenance issues was an “evidence dump” with no specific details such
as dates, times, remedy, etc.
 
5.       
I found the Tenants were not
able to raise their issues during the hearing.
In making this finding, I considered the fact the N12 was served to the Tenants more than
one year ago. This means, the Tenants had one year from the date they
vacated the rental unit to file a T5 application with the Board to raise their
concerns. They did not do this and
are now out of time on this issue. With respect to the maintenance issues, the
Tenants did not provide clear and sufficient details that properly put the
Landlord on notice. My finding is in keeping with the guidance
of the Court in Ball v Metro Capital
Management Inc. [[2002]
OJ No 5931 (Div Crt)]. Here the
Divisional Court held that the responding party must know the case to be met, and that notice should include dates and
times of the alleged conduct, together with a detailed description of the
alleged conduct.
 
L9 Application
 
6.       
The Tenants did not pay the total rent they were required to pay
for the period from April 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020.
 
7.       
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
8.       
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on November
30, 2020.
 
9.       
The lawful monthly rent was $2,163.50.
 
10.    The Tenant’s confirmed
that they did not pay the Landlord
the monthly rent for April
2020.
 
11.    The Landlord is seeking an order for arrears of rent for April 2020 ($2,163.50) and the
cost for filing ($186.00) this application.




 
12.   
The Landlord is holding a last months
rent deposit in the amount of $1,900.00 which was collected March 1, 2010. The Landlord owes interest on the last
month’s rent deposit for the period of March 1, 2011 to November 30, 2020. I note, in the application, the Landlord tried to
claim the interest ($213.50) she owes on the last month rent deposit as arrears
of rent owed by the Tenants. She
conceded at the hearing that this was a mistake on her part and should be
removed from her claim for arrears of rent.
 
13.    The Landlord testified
and indicated in her application that she incurred
charges of
$48.00 for a cheque tendered by the Tenants, which was returned NSF and
$20.00 for related administration charges.
RJ testified that the NSF fee resulted from the Landlord trying
to cash the rent cheque for November 2020, despite the last month’s rent being
used for November 2020. The Landlord confirmed that she tried to cash the November 2020 rent cheque despite the last
month’s rent being used for the month of November 2020 because she wanted the money
to pay for the arrears
of rent owed for
April 2020.
 
Findings
 
14.   
On a balance of probabilities, I
am satisfied that the arrears of rent owed to the Landlord by the Tenants is
$2,163.50, plus the cost ($186.00) for filing this application. In making my finding, I considered evidence of both parties that the Tenants
did not pay the monthly rent for April 2020 which
resulted in the need for the Landlord to file this application.
 
15.   
I am not satisfied that the
Landlord is entitled to be compensated for the NSF fees she incurred as a
result of trying to cash the cheque for the monthly rent of November 2020. In
making this finding, I considered the evidence of both parties that the Tenants
moved out of the rental unit on November
30, 2020 and the last month’s rent deposit covered
the monthly rent for November
2020. As such, the Landlord should not have tried to cash the Tenant’s cheque dated
November 1, 2020. The Landlord
incurred this charge from because of her own behaviour and not through the
conduct of the Tenants.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenant’s request for review is granted.
 
2.       
Order TNL-30105-21 issued on November 15, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,163.50, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to November 30, 2020.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 26,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
