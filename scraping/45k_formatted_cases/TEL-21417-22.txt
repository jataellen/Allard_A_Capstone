Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21417-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


103, 3400 EGLINGTON AVE E TORONTO ON
  M1J2H8


 




Between:


Premax Management Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yuraslau P Kishchuk


Tenant



 
 
 
Premax Management Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Yuraslau P
Kishchuk (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on November 9, 2021 with
respect to application TEL-18576-21, which order was amended on February 2,
2022 and further amended on February 9, 2022.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the
Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $493.44 arrears on
or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,960.68 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-18576-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $2,660.68 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-18576-21 is cancelled, including any amendments thereto.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $880.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2015 to February 22, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-18576-21 (including amendments TEL-18576-21-AM and TEL-18576-21-
AM2) is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,430.86*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 22, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$31.72 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
