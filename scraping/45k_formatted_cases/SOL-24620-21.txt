Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24620-21



In the matter
of:


52 BALDWIN STREET DUNDAS ON L9H1A8


 




Between:


Simon Caputi Dominic Caputi


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Damian Irvine James
Gouthro Suzann Irvine
Zachery Gouthro


Tenants



 
 
Simon Caputi and Dominic Caputi (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict James Gouthro, Zachery Gouthro, Damian
Irvine and Suzann Irvine (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord,
Simon Caputi, attended the hearing. As of 10:49
a.m. the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice
of Termination effective September 10, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,150.00.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $2,150.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for
the period from November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlords $9,396.07*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also
pay to the Landlords $70.68 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January 17, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $13,561.00** to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 17, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
