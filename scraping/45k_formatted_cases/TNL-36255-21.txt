Between:

and


 




 


Jorge Jimenez Laetitia Villetorte


Tenants



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnersh Ip (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Laetitia
Villetorte and Jorge Jimenez (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on July 5, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-29468-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay $504.27 towards the arrears, on or before October 28,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $2,904.27 for rent arrears
and NSF cheque charges and
the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-29468-20. The
amount that is still owing from
that order is $604.27 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order TNL-29468-20 is cancelled.




 
 
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,735.01 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from November 1, 2020 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-29468-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $1,147.28*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 7, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$57.04 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
