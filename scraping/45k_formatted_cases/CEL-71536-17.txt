Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

AK and MK (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict BCB, AWH and JMB (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 Application).
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlords for the damage
(L2 Application). 
 
This application was heard in Barrie on January 23,
2018.
 
Only the Landlords’ Legal
Representative, NK and the Landlord, MK attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
Regarding L1 rent owing
application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to
January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective November 6, 2017.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,690.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 22, 2015 to November 6, 2017.
4.     
The Tenants vacated the
rental unit as of December 9, 2017.
5.     
The rent arrears owing to
December 9, 2017 are $3,880.04.
Regarding L2 damage application
Amendment to L2 re amount of damage claimed
6.     
At the commencement of the hearing the
Landlord's Legal Representative sought an amendment to the amount claimed for
damage to the rental unit.  The Landlord's Legal Representative said the
Landlord now has more accurate estimates of the costs to repair the damage
alleged and requested that the amount claimed is increased from $7,000 to $11,000.
7.     
The Landlord did not take any steps as
provided for under the rules to amend the application and serve the Tenants. 
As a consequence the Tenants had no notice about this substantial change in the
amount claimed.  The Landlord's Legal Representative chose not to adjourn the
hearing to amend their application and serve the Tenants.  
N5 notice -
damage
8.     
On October 28, 2017, the Tenants were given a
first N5 Notice of Termination under section 62 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act').  This N5 notice
did not become void because the Tenant did not correct the problem within the 7
day time period set out in the notice.
9.     
At issue is whether the Tenants willfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit or residential complex.
10.  
Section 89 of the Act states that a landlord may
apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that
the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair or replacement of
damaged property if the tenant wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to
the rental unit.
11.  
I am satisfied that the Tenants negligently
caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex.
12.  
Several panels of the garage door were removed
and patched with a piece of wood.
13.  
The glass panel of the unit entry door is
cracked and the Tenants have taped the cracks.
14.  
The drum of the dryer is completely removed.
15.  
The carpets in the bedrooms are heavily stained
and cannot be cleaned.
16.  
The main floor bathroom vanity cabinet door is
broken.
17.  
The trim on the interior
door giving entry into the garage has been damaged such that the door cannot be
opened or closed.
18.  
The Tenants constructed a room
in the basement of the unit without the Landlords’ permission.  This
construction does not comply with the required building and electrical
standards.  The Landlords are required to remove the room.
19.  
There is damage to a bedroom
door, the living room wall, holes in the second main floor bathroom, a large
hole in the main floor (master bedroom) bathroom wall and a hole in the interior
door giving entry into the garage.
20.  
The front panel of the
dishwasher has been completely removed.
21.  
The Landlord submitted photos
of the damaged property which indicate that the damage is not such that results
from reasonable wear and tear.
22.  
The Landlord is entitled to 8,242.14
representing:
a)   
$850.00 for the cost to
replace the glass insert of the entry door as substantiated in the invoice from
Summit Glass Inc. dated December 19, 2017;
b)   
$293.44 to replace the
damaged interior doors as supported by the receipt from Lowe’s dated December
30, 2017;
c)   
$316.00 to replace the
vanity as supported by a Lowe’s receipt dated December 26, 2017;
d)   
$697.20 to replace the
damaged dishwasher as substantiated by the Lowe’s receipt dated December 26,
2017;
e)   
$901.71 to replace the
damaged dryer which is supported by Lowe’s receipt dated December 26, 2017;
f)    
$974.91 to replace the
bedroom carpets with laminate flooring which was a lower cost than carpet.  The
Landlord provided a receipt from Lowe’s in support of this cost;
g)   
$208.98 to replace damaged
flooring, $37.27 to replace a broken bathroom door privacy lock and $63.27 to
replace the bathroom faucet because the original faucet did not fit the new
vanity;
h)   
$3,899.36 for the costs to
remove the room constructed by the Tenants.  The Landlord submitted a receipt
dated December 30, 2017 from 2449859 Ontario Inc. for $3,899.36 for the
construction work.
23.  
I am not allowing the claim
of $1,400 to replace the garage door because the Landlord did not provide any
evidence to substantiate the amount claimed such as a quote.
24.  
I am also not allowing the
cost claimed for removal of garbage from the rental unit because there was
insufficient evidence to conclude that this cost was connected to the damage in
the rental unit or residential complex.  Section 89 requires that the costs
incurred are for the repair of or replacement of damaged property.
25.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would not be necessary to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act because the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenants terminated as of December 9, 2017.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $10,361.87, which represents the amount of rent owing up to December
9, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit and the cost to repair/replace the damaged property.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 9, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
