Jenna Boyd


Tenant



 
 
 
Bruno Malfara (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jenna Boyd
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video/teleconference on January 6, 2022.
 
Bruno Malfara (BM), the Landlords’ legal representative George
Brown, the Tenant and her legal representative, Vivian Ruzsvanszky,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On May 20, 2016, the Tenant entered
into a lease agreement. The Landlord named in the lease is a corporation, “MM2014”. The
Tenant has been paying rent to MM2014 throughout the tenancy.
 
2.    
BM is the sole shareholder of
MM2014.
 
3.    
On or about May 31, 2021, MM2014
served the Tenant
a Notice of Termination, Form N12, with the termination date of July 19, 2021 because BM’s parents wished
to move into the rental unit.
 
4.    
Until July 19, 2021, MM2014 had a
100% ownership interest in the rental unit. After BM realized that a
corporation could not serve an N12 Notice of Termination, he transferred part
ownership of the property to himself for $1.00. On July 31, 2021, the Tenant
was then served with a new Notice of Termination that named the Landlords as MM2014
and BM.
 
5.     However, this second
Notice of Termination was defective because
it did not correctly set out the termination date as required
by subsection 48(2) of the Act.




 
6.    
Therefore, on or about August 9, 2021, the Tenant was served with a third Notice of Termination, which is the subject of
this application.
 
7.    
The third N12 Notice of Termination identifies the Landlords
as MM 2014 and BM. Law and analysis:
8.    
The N12 Notice of Termination
was served pursuant to section
48 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) which states, in part:
 
48 (1) A landlord may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at
least one year by,
(a)              
the landlord;
(b)              
the landlord’s spouse;
(c)              
a
child or parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse; or
(d)              
a person who provides or will
provide care services to the landlord, the landlord’s spouse, or a child or
parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse, if the person receiving the care services
resides or will reside in the building,
related group of buildings, mobile home park or land lease community
in which the rental unit is located.
 
(2) The date for termination specified in the notice shall be at
least 60 days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy
ends or, where the
tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term
 
9.    
Subsection 48 (5) of the Act states:
 
(a)    
This section does not authorize a landlord to give a notice of termination of a
tenancy with respect to a rental unit unless,
(a)              
the rental unit is owned in whole or in part by an individual;
and
(b)              
the landlord is an individual [emphasis added]
 
10.  Therefore, pursuant to subsection 48(5)(b), only a
landlord who is an individual is authorized to serve a tenant with an N12
Notice of Termination on the ground that the landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
11.  In this instance, I find that the only genuine
Landlord is MM2014, a corporation. I recognize that the definition of
“landlord” in section 2(1) of the Act includes an owner of a rental unit and I
also recognize that there may be more than one landlord for a single rental
unit given the broad definition of this term. However, BM acquired his partial
ownership interest in the rental
unit from a corporation that he
alone controls for the token amount of $1.00 for the sole purpose of being able to evict the
Tenant pursuant to section 48 of the Act.
 
12.  Section 202 of the Act
states:




 
202 (1) In making findings
on an application, the Board shall ascertain
the real substance of all transactions and
activities relating to a residential complex or a rental unit and the good
faith of the participants and in doing so,
(a)     may
disregard the outward
form of a transaction or the separate
corporate existence of
participants; and
(b)    
may have regard to the pattern
of activities relating
to the residential complex or the
rental unit
 
13.  In this instance, the real substance
of the transfer of part ownership of the property
to BM was for the sole
purpose of evicting the Tenant. The true Landlord was and continues to be a corporation, MM2014, not BM.
Since MM2014 is not an individual,
it cannot give the Tenant a Notice of Termination
for owner’s own use. This interpretation
is consistent with the intent of
subsection 48(5) which is to deny corporate landlords to evict tenants for
Landlord’s own use.
 
14.  As I have found that MM2014, a corporation, is the
only genuine Landlord, the N12 Notice of Termination served on August 9, 2021 does not comply
with section 48 of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
