Tenant



 
 
 
Nikola Paradina
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Csaba
Babos (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owe; and, because the Tenant has been persistently
late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Representative B. Burd attended the hearing.
At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw
its L2 application.
