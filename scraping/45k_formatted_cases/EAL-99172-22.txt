  matter of:


470, 1 NELSON RUE OTTAWA ON K1N9E8


 




Between:


Logement Communautaire D'ottawa


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Nafiisa Xasan Axmed


Tenant



 
 
On December 23, 2021, Logement Communautaire D'ottawa (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Nafiisa Xasan Axmed (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on March 5, 2021
with respect to application EAL-91427-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
For a period of 12 months,
the Tenant agreed
that there will be no issue that would
give rise to the Landlord serving another N5 notice to the Tenant based on
similar issues to those in the N5 notices filed with the application.
 
In particular :
 
i)         
The Tenant agreed that she will not throw garbage into her neighbour’s yard;
ii)        
The Tenant agreed that she will correctly dispose
of her garbage in a sealed
garbage bag whether it is placed outside near the street or in the garage.
 
On November
25, 2021, the Landlord received
a complaint that the Tenant had
throw garbage into the neighbour’s yard.
 
On
December 7, 2021, the Landlord received a complaint that the Tenant had not
disposed of her garbage in sealed garbage
bag. Her garbage
was dispersed in the
garage common area.
