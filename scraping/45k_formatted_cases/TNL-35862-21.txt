(S/E ADDITION), 14421 BATHURST STREET AURORA ON L4G7A3

Landlord

Jesse Christie


Tenant



 
 
 
Eduard Fitingof (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jesse Christie (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has
three or fewer residential units.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
974 4825 8231#
on February 3, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. Alla Gelman-Fitingof and Lucase Fitingof attended as witnesses for the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord lives in the
residential complex which contains three or fewer units. The Landlord is permitted to serve the Tenant a N7 Notice of Termination under section 65 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.     The Tenant smoked in the unit on September 1, 2021 at 1:15 am, throughout the day on September 6, 2021 and September 8,
2021. The Landlord has given 2 warning letters
before issuing this N7 Notice on March 20, 2021 and August 30,
2021.
 
3.    
Although the Tenant testified that
he doesn’t smoke and the odour is from cooking food, the Landlord and two witnesses
testified the smoke odour from cigarettes and marijuana is strong; it emanates
into their unit via the
shared central heating ventilation system and vents between the Tenant’s
kitchen and the Landlord’s bedroom;
and is causing difficulty
breathing, pollution of the air quality which disrupts their ability to
concentrate and sleep.
 
4.     On a balance of probabilities, and based on the best
evidence before me, I find the Tenant and/or a person
permitted in the residential complex
by the Tenant, smokes in the
rental unit which substantially interferes with the Landlord’s reasonable
enjoyment of the




File Number: TNL-35862-21
 
residential complex
and interests because
the Tenant’s action
contravenes a condition
of their tenancy agreement.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
6.     The Landlord didn’t challenge the Tenant’s evidence
that he’s heard no complaints from other tenants living
in the complex. The Landlord’s photograph shows a pile of cigarettes
outside which suggests that Tenant is using the designated smoking area at
times outside.
 
7.     A conditional order will allow the Tenant a chance to
preserve the tenancy which was not available to him given he was served an N7
Notice that was non-voidable. It will
also deter the Tenant, or his guest from smoking in the rental
unit knowing his tenancy may be
a risk.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant, occupant of the rental unit or guest shall
not smoke any substance in the rental unit that substantially interferes with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex or lawful right, privilege and interest.
 
2.     If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 1 of this
order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board within
the next 12 months pursuant to section 78 of
the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord may file an application within 30 days
from the date of the breach.
