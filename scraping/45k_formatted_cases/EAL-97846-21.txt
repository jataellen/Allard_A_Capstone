2, 1421
LAROSE AVENUE OTTAWA ON

Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Peter Westaway


Tenant



 
 
 
Stefano Manzoni (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter Westaway (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord in a residential complex that has three or fewer residential units. ; because
the number of persons living in the unit on a continuing basis is more than permitted by
health, safety or housing standards
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 12, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
Between July 2021 and September
28, 2021 when the application was filed the Tenant sent 70 texts messages to
the Landlord. On September 23, 2021
the Tenant spoke loudly and yelled at the Landlord when asked to speak lower.
That same day the Tenant also stomps on the floor and caused a noise
disturbance. On September 24, 2021, the Landlord heard noise indicative of the Tenant
dropped things in his unit between 4:00 and
6:00 a.m. and later that day the Tenant talked loud to ensure that he was
heard.
 
2.    
The Landlord has not persuaded
me that the Tenant’s conduct interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of his rental unit or residential complex to the level of substantial pursuant section 65(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
3.     There were no details about the content of the 70 text
messages except that on August 24, 2021, the Tenant sent a text to the Landlord that included name calling, profanity and insulting language. The Tenant’s conduct is not appropriate,
rude and offensive but one incident of name calling doesn’t meet the threshold
of substantial interference.




File Number: EAL-97846-21
 
4.    
The Landlord did not talk or investigate the noise he heard during the early morning hours on September 24, 2021 and two incidents
of the Tenant intentionally talking
loudly so that he is heard and one
incident of stomping his feet does not meet noise disturbances that reach the
level of substantial that would
warrant terminating this tenancy.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
