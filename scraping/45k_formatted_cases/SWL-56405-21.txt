Betsy Gordon

Tenants




 
 
On September
30, 2021, Michael Ross (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Betsy Gordon, Michael Labadie and
Mitch Pearson (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on October 5, 2021 with respect to application SWL- 46717-20 AM.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$300.00 on or before September
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or
all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $10,686.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-46717-20 AM. The amount that is still owing from that order is $9,386.00
and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SWL-46717-20 AM is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have also
failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
September 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 19, 2021 to January 5, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-46717-20 AM is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,086.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to September 30, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee
for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $39.45
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 1,
2021 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
