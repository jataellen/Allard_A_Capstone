Order under
Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


 
File Number:
SWT-42981-20




 
In the matter
of:


 
573 EPHRAIM STREET KITCHENER ON N2B2C7


 




Between:


Jason Van Belle


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Nick Lopes


Landlord



 
 
 
Jason Van Belle (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Nick Lopes (the 'Landlord') entered the rental unit
illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on October 4, 2021.
 
Only the Tenant
attended the hearing. As of 9:50 a.m., the Landlord was not present or
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant alleges that
the Landlord illegally entered the rental unit, packed up his belongings, and delivered them to his sister. However,
the Landlord still has possession of the Tenant’s tv, router,
dresser, mattress and end table.
 
2.    
On any application before
the Board, the person who alleges any particular incident or event occurred
has the burden
of leading sufficient evidence to establish
that it is more likely than
not that their version of events is true. In this case that burden falls on the
Tenant.
 
3.    
The Tenant led
insufficient evidence to establish that that the Landlord illegally entered his rental
unit. I say this because
the Tenant’s evidence
lacked details with respect to the
date of entry. The Tenant also did not have receipts or other evidence to
corroborate the items he claims are still in possession of the Landlord.
 
4.    
Therefore, the Tenant’s application must be dismissed.




File Number: SWT-42981-20
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Tenant’s
application is dismissed.
