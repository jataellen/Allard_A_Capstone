Tenants




 
 
 
Eli Elkoubi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carolie
Guerin and Rene Guerin (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 11:43 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on May 1, 2021. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is
$850.00.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of May 1, 2021,
the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,732.81*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to May 1, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: EAL-94777-21
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before May 12, 2021, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from May 13,
2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
