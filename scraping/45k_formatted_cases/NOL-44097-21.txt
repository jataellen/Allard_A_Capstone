Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44097-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


4, 98 KING STREET DRYDEN ON P8N1B9


 




Between:


Christine Mcgogy


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chris
Mendel


Tenant



 
 
 
Christine Mcgogy
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris
Mendel (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
Since the Landlord served the notice of termination on the Tenant in September
2021 the Tenant has stopped
paying rent.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $945.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 1, 2018 to
November 30, 2021
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
24, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44097-21
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$382.70, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 1, 2021 to January 13, 2022, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$31.07 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
