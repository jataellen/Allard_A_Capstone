Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02333-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2837 OLD FORT ROAD MIDLAND ON L4R4K3


 




Between:


Susan Doane Carole Coutts


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Carly
Danielle Shawnna Parrell


Tenant



 
 
 
Susan Doane and
Carole Coutts (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Carly Danielle
Shawnna Parrell (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021. Only the Landlords’ Agent, Allison
MacSporran, attended the hearing. As of 4:09 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective August 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from February 5, 2021 to
August 14, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




 
Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $12,890.29*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at
.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $16,386.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
