Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-96088-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2203, 420 GLOUCESTER STREET OTTAWA ON K1R7T7


 




Between:


Bronson Place/manor Park Mgmt Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sloodiash Cajuste


Tenant



 
 
 
Bronson Place/manor Park Mgmt Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sloodiash Cajuste (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative Nelson Lamoureux attended the hearing. As of 9:26 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly notified
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective May 21, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $1,132.20
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,065.35 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2017 to May 21, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $2,180.00 after the application was filed.




 
7.    
The Landlord set out
their efforts to negotiate a repayment plan for the arrears. The Tenant had been a tenant since 2017, and the Landlord
was willing to afford the Tenant
an opportunity to save the Tenancy if the directed payments were made on time
and in full.
 
8.    
The Tenant should be aware that all of the rent and arrears
payments due dates are
all “on or before” the date specified meaning that the Tenant must make sure
that these payments are made by that date. The Tenant must also make sure that
the payments are made in full by the due date. If the Tenant is late with a
payment, does not make a payment or only makes a partial payment the Landlord
can file paperwork with the Board that, if correct, would result in an order
for eviction. If there may be an issue, the Tenant is encouraged to contact the
Landlord prior to the default.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$7,095.80 which represents the amount of rent
owing and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenants is denied
on the condition that:
(a)  The Tenants shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months
of February 2022 to
June 2022, and no later than the 1th day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenants fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, excluding the costs, and by the dates
required, then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already
ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days
of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
