Lynn Ireland                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
 
Michael Gardiner
and Waverider Properties Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lynn Ireland (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
20, 2022. The Landlord,
Michael Gardiner, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
September 9, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the lawful monthly
rent is $1,331.59.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,290.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2020 to January 2, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
7.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent
arrears ($6,385.00), and costs ($201.00), is $6,586.59.
 
Section 83




File Number: SWL-55655-21
 
8.    
The Tenant proposed to pay an additional $1,331.59 on top of the monthly
rent to pay down the arrears. According to the Tenant’s proposal, the
arrears would be paid in 5 months. The Landlords opposed the proposed payment
agreement and sought a standard order of eviction.
 
9.     After considering the submission of the parties,
I find that it would
be unfair to grant the Tenant’s payment plan. I say this
because the parties came before the Board on a different arrears application
which was heard on September 9, 2021. That application was resolved by way of a
consent order wherein the Tenant agreed to a payment plan with the Landlord. However,
the Tenant breached
that payment plan and has not made any payments to the Landlord since
this application was filed.
 
10.  The Tenant explained that she entered into the payment
plan because she felt bullied and
coerced. She also entered into the payment plan because she believed that she
would be getting a student loan to help her pay the arrears. However, her
student loan was denied. I am not satisfied by the Tenant’s explanation. Even
if the Tenant’s student loan was declined, the Tenant could have made some good
faith payments towards the arrears. Based on the lack of good faith payments
from the Tenant on the previous agreement between the parties, and the fact that
the Tenant has not made any payments
since the application was filed,
I am not satisfied that the Tenant will follow
through on the payment plan she now proposes.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 21,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. Postponing the eviction will
allow the Tenant time to pay the amount required to void this order should she
wish to stay or make alternate housing arrangements.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,594.54*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 21, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $43.78 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 22, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 22,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 22, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i) $6,586.59
if the payment is made on or before January
31, 2022, or ii)$7,918.18 if the payment
is made on or before
February 21, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
