Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55821-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
306, 1580 ERNEST
AVENUE LONDON ON N6E2T9


 




Between:


Sana Khalaf


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brandy Lacroix


Tenant



 
 
Sana Khalaf (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Brandy Lacroix (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
27, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s Notice of Termination (N4) is defective
because it does not “set out the amount of rent due” as required by subsection
59(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 206
(the ‘Act’). The N4 includes
additional charges for items that are not rent, such as last months rent and a key deposit.
 
2.     The Board does not have jurisdiction to terminate the tenancy on a defective
notice. Therefore, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
