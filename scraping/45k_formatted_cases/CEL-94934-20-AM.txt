Amended Order
 
The address
of the rental unit is amended to include the word “East” in the street address. The amendment was granted at the
hearing but was not updated accordingly. No other changes have been made.
 
Ranee Management (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher Hogan
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Ilana
Glickman, attended the hearing. As of 2:30 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 9,
2020.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,525.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,525.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: CEL-94934-20-AM
 
5.    
The Tenant credited the Tenant’s account
by $45.17 after the application was filed. This represents the interest paid on the
last month's rent deposit. This credit has been reflected as a payment on the
Schedule.
 
6.     The Landlord has paid interest on the rent deposit up
to December 31, 2020. If the tenancy terminates pursuant
to this order,
the Landlord will not owe any further
interest on the rent deposit.
 
7.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $30,289.50*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.14
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$32,154.83 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$33,679.83 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the




File Number: CEL-94934-20-AM
 
appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
