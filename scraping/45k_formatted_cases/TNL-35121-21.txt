Dellana Hickson
  Noel Wright


Tenants



 
 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential
Growth Fund II (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Dellana
Hickson and Noel Wright (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, Sharon Harris, and the Tenants attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,570.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2021 to
September 24, 2021.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,996.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($1,810.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.




 
2.     The Tenants made a payment
of $500.00 recently, however it has not yet been posted on the Landlord’s account. This
amount has not been factored into the amount owing under this order, but shall
be credited to the $1,000.00 payable on January 28, 2022 identified in the schedule below.
 
3.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition that the Tenants pay
the amount identified in paragraph one and the ongoing rent as follows:
