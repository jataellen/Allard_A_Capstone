Landlord




 


and


 




 


Safia Lindsay


Tenant



 
Kipps Lane Property Management
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Safia Lindsay (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Sarah Labadie, attended the hearing. As of 10:41 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
1, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,007.35.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,007.35 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from November 1, 2020 to October 3, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $1,007.35 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December
1, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SWL-55989-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $202.09*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
1, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
