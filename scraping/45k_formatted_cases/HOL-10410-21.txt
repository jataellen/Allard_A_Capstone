In the matter
of:


564 CANDLESTICK CIRCLE MISSISSAUGA ON L4Z0B1


 




Between:


Eman Karcour


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mandy Erin Danielle Taylor


Tenant



 
 
 
Eman Karcour (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marco Marques and Mandy Erin Danielle Taylor (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. The Landlord’s representative, Elaine
Page attended the hearing. Despite
being served with a notice of hearing by the Board, the Tenant was not
present or represented.
 
Oppong Waife (OW), representative for Marco Marques,
who was named as a Tenant on the
Landlord’s L1 application was present.
 
Request to Amend the Application
 
1.   
The Landlord’s representative (EP)
and the representative for Marco Marques (MM), Oppong Waife (OW) jointly
requested the Landlord’s L1 application be amended to remove MM as a party.
They submitted MM had been a tenant however that tenancy terminated in
September 2020. At that point the current Tenant, who had been residing in the
rental as a common-law spouse of MM became the new, sole Tenant. The rent arrears
claimed in the application were from the period after
MM was no longer the tenant.
 
2.    Based on the uncontested submissions of the parties,
the Board consents
to the amendment of the
application to remove MM as a Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
Request for Costs
 
3.   
OW requested the Landlord be
ordered to pay costs to MM related to expenses incurred to defend the
Landlord’s application. While it was uncontested the Tenant was informed the week before the hearing the Landlord would request to remove MM as a Tenant, OW




 
asserted the Landlord should have done this many months prior.
Had the Landlord
taken timely action, MM would not have had to retain legal
representation and incurred associated costs.
 
4.    EP provided competing evidence regarding notice to the
MM that the Landlord would request the application be amended to remove him as
a tenant. While she had not prepared to provide
specific dates, she testified she had personally informed MM several months ago of the Landlord’s
intention to remove him as a party.
 
5.   
Pursuant to section 23(1)
of the Statutory Powers Procedures Act, a tribunal
may make such orders as it
considers proper to prevent an abuse of its processes.
 
6.  Subsections 204(2) through
(4) of the Act govern the imposition of such awards:
 
(2) The Board
may order a party to an application to
pay the costs of another party.
 
7.   
Interpretive Guideline
3 sets out the Board’s
position on when it may be appropriate to order costs:
“A Member has the discretion to require a party, a party’s agent or a party’s
legal representative to pay, as costs, any representation or preparation expenses
of another party where the conduct of the party, a party’s agent or a
party’s
legal representative was unreasonable.”
 
8.   
Even if the Landlord had not
informed the Tenant of their intention to request the application to be amended
and remove him as a party prior to the week before
the hearing, I do not find the actions of the Landlord have met
the fairly high bar to be deemed unreasonable. Consequently, I am denying the
request for costs.
 
 
L1 Application
 
9.   
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 30, 2021.
 
10. The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
September 20, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
11. The monthly rent is $2,700.00.
 
12. The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
13. The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,600.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




 
14. Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2018 to
April 30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of September
30, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $31,586.95*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
20, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
