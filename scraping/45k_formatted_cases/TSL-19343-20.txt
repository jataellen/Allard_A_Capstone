Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


B, 1037 COXWELL AVENUE TORONTO ON M4C3G4


 




Between:


Gail Tapiero
G3 Harmonic Inc.


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Liam Alan Guha
Raddie Megan Boxall


Tenants



 
 
 
Gail Tapiero
and G3 Harmonic Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Liam Alan Guha Raddie and Megan Boxall (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 12, 2021. The Landlord’ Agents,
Gail and Maurice Tapiero, were represented by Masoud Tchavoshi. The Tenant Liam Alan Guha Raddie attended
and was represented by Bhavin Bilimoria.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
based on a Notice of Termination (N12) served on the Tenants on November 26, 2020 with a termination date of January
31, 2021, because
the Landlords’ child required
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation
pursuant to s. 48 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act , 2006 (the
“Act’).
 
2.    
At the outset of the
hearing the representative for the Tenant raised the issue of corporate
ownership of the rental complex
and the fact the N12 was served
on behalf of a
corporation, specifically G3 Harmonic Inc
 
3.    
The Rental Agreement
dated August 14, 2014 between the parties identifies G3 Harmonic Inc as
the Landlord. The Notice of Termination (N12) served on the Tenants identifies the Landlord as G3 Harmonic
Inc. and the application was filed in the
name of G3 Harmonic Inc and
Gail Tapiero.
 
4.    
The Tenants’
Representative also submitted a copy of the Land Registry for the rental
address. On November 16, 2020 G3 Harmonic. Inc transferred 1% of ownership to Yael




 
Tapiero. Yael Tapiero is not listed on Notice of Termination nor the application as a landlord.
 
5.    
On September 1, 2017,
section 48(5) of the Act came into effect pursuant to the Rental Fairness Act,
2017. This provision provides that an
own use notice under subsection 48(1) may only be given
if the rental unit is owned in whole or in part by an individual and that the landlord is an individual:
 
48 (5) This section
does not authorize
a landlord to give notice
of termination of a
tenancy with respect to a rental until unless,
 
(a)   the rental unit is owned in whole or in part by an individual: and
 
(b)   the landlord is an individual.
 
5.   
Although G3 Harmonic Inc may be owned in whole or in part by an individual, the Agents
were not listed on the Notice of Termination, nor the application. There is no authority in the Act to amend
a notice of termination. As a result,
I find the N12 is invalid and the application is dismissed.
 
Costs:
 
6.   
The Tenant’s
Representative is requesting the Board order costs be paid by the Landlord
because the Landlord issued the notice in bad faith.
As evidence of bad faith,
the Tenant’s Representative
indicated an identical application had been served on another Tenant for the
same reason. Their evidentiary submission included an N12 served on another
tenant on January 26, 2021.
 
7.   
The existence of another similar
notice is not, in and of itself,
evidence of bad faith. I note
the other notice was served on January 26, 2021, two months after this N12 was
served. Although no decision on the merits of this application was rendered,
the existence of the second notice is not indicative of bad faith where the
second notice was served after the notice before me. No costs will be ordered.
 
It is ordered that:
