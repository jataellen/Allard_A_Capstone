File Number: CEL-99427-21
 
 
In the matter of:      76 PEACHLEAF CRESCENT
BRAMPTON ON L7A2B4
 
Between:                  Emmanuel Tchokongoue                                    Landlord

Nish Aakriti Sahil Bhutani Yuma Mungeni


Tenants




 
 
 
Emmanuel Tchokongoue (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sahil
Bhutani, Yuma Mungeni and Nish Aakriti (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex
have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord
has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord
for the damage; because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant; and because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of
purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on May 25, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served
the Tenants with an N12 notice stating
that he sold the property
and that the purchaser requires it for his own use. However, the
Landlord did not comply with all the requirements of the Act when issuing
the N12 notice.
The Landlord did not pay any
compensation to the Tenants and the Landlord did not file an
affidavit/declaration as required by the Act. The purchaser did not file a
affidavit certifying that he, in good faith, requires the unit for his own
personal use.
 
 
2.     The Landlord also served an N5 notice on the Tenants
alleging that the Tenants substantially interfered with the lawful right,
privilege, and interest of the Landlord by damaging the stove in the rental
unit. However, the Landlord failed to provide enough evidence to prove that the damage
was caused by the Tenants
in this application. Other

tenants resided at the rental
property when the damage was caused and there is insufficient evidence
to place the blame entirely
on the Tenants listed in this application. On a balance of
probabilities, I am not satisfied that the Tenants of this application are
responsible for the damaged property (kitchen stove) claimed by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
