Justin Last (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.

although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.

The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to November 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 6, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,640.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,640.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2021 to August 6, 2021.
 
6.      The Tenant paid $800.00 after the application was filed.




File Number: EAL-98050-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy is terminated as of November 30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit

represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November

deposit.
