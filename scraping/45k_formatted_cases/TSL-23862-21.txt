Rpms Property
Management Services Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Kester Norman (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlords Legal Representative Jason Paine and the Landlord Agent Jeshi Palmo
attended the hearing. As of 1:45 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly notified of
this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
served an N5 notice of termination on the Tenant
August 12, 2021. The
voiding period for this N5 was August 12-19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
could not demonstrate that during the voiding period that the Tenant did not
void the notice of termination.
 
3.    
The Tenant
is deemed to have voided
the notice, unless
the Landlord can demonstrate
conduct the contrary. As a result,
the application could not succeed.
