George Somogyi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tatiana Nikolaeva and Yevgueniy Nikolayev
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord and the Tenants signed
an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of November 30, 2021 and the Tenants
did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination
date set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 23, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January 23, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.
