Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35727-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


225 LAKE DRIVE
NORTH KESWICK ON L4P3C8


 




Between:


Yong Li


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John
  Gouveia


Tenant



 
 
 
Yong Li (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Gouveia (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 6, 2022 at 3:00 PM.
 
The Landlord’s representative, Tun Tao Li, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
Jin Mo An provided testimony for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons set out below, I find that
the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
On August
29, 2021, the Landlords served
the Tenants with an N12 notice of termination
seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by
a purchaser. The termination date set out in the N12 notice is November 14,
2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord paid the
Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on September 27 and 28, 2021 by
two interac e-transfers. The Tenant
later returned these e-transfers to the Landlord. I find that the receipt of the e-transfers by the Tenant
satisfied the Landlord’s compensation requirement under the Act, and that the returning
of the funds to the Landlord
created a credit in the Tenant’s favour for future rent due to the Landlord for
a rental period after the termination date in the Notice of Termination. The net effect is that the Landlord must
credit the returned payment to the Tenant’s rent ledger.




 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $3,200.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 15, 2020 to November 14, 2021.
 
Service of the N12
 
6.    
The N12 notice of
termination was served on the Tenant by regular mail. The Tenant denied having received the notice, and claims to have
had no knowledge of the Landlord’s steps to terminate the tenancy until
December of 2021, when he received a notice of hearing
from the Board. He claims that the defect in service
renders the Notice of Termination void.
 
7.    
Subsection 191(1) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) provides that “A notice or document is sufficiently given to a person other
than the Board… by leaving
it in the mail box where mail
is ordinarily delivered to the person.” The
method of service used by the Landlord’s representative was accordingly
strictly compliant with the requirements of Act. It also complies with Rule 3 of the Board’s Rules of Procedure.
 
8.    
This Board has however
not interpreted professed or actual compliance with service requirements in a
vacuum, and has viewed them through the lens of procedural fairness. In
SWL-26206-RV-AM (Re), 2009 CanLII 74516 (ON LTB), Member Wallace, in addressing similar
defective service of a notice of
termination, noted (at para 12), “It is not
solely a matter of whether
a landlord served
documents in accordance with the applicable Rules. The Board’s Rules of Practice are to be interpreted broadly to
secure the just, most expeditious and cost effective result, allowing all
parties to know the case against them and to be heard in the matter.” In other words, where a question of the
effectiveness of service arises, and there is a doubt as to whether the party
served upon had actual notice
of a notice, application, or other document,
the prejudice to the
recipient party’s procedural fairness rights must be considered.
 
9.    
The Tenant testified
that he new of the property being listed, and also received compensation equal to one month’s rent by an e-transfer. I believe that the Tenant ought
to have known that a sale was being effected, and even if communication was
imperfect, had or ought to have had some knowledge of the process against him. Furthermore, the Tenant’s concerns about
the effect of a lack of receipt of the notice of termination relate entirely to
his ability to find a replacement rental unit, which can be addressed by
considerations of exercising discretion under section 83 of the Act to delay
the eviction. Having regard to the finding
of Member Wallace
noted above, in order to “secure the just,
most expeditious and cost effective result”, I believe that any procedural
prejudice that the Tenant has had in consequence of imperfect service is
properly addressed by my analysis under relief from eviction, and that it is not necessary to set aside the
provisions of subsection 191(1) to ensure a procedurally fair outcome in the
circumstances.




 
Good Faith
 
10.  The N12 was served pursuant
to section 49 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 49(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlords must establish that
at the time of the service of the N12 Notice, a purchaser required, in good
faith, the unit for residential use.
 
11.  In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII
10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention
to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v.
Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where
the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the
Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also
have additional motives for selecting a particular rental unit, but this does
not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
12.  The Landlord entered into an agreement of
purchase and sale dated August 16, 2021, with
Jin Mo An as the purchaser. At the date of the hearing, the transaction had a closing date of January 31, 2022. Ms. An swore an affidavit which was filed
with the application confirming that she required the rental unit for
her residential use. She also provided oral testimony at the hearing to provide further context. She indicated that she intends to mover
her family into the house, and previously sold her home in Mississauga. She is currently living in a temporary
rental accommodation.
 
13.  As the good faith intention of Ms. An was
not substantively challenged by the Tenant, I accept that the purchaser in good faith
requires the rental
unit for residential purposes
for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief from eviction
 
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
15.  Ms. An testified that the purchase is
currently scheduled to close on January 31, 2022, and that she has temporary accommodation
until that time. On my questioning her as to whether a further extension
would cause her to back out of the transaction or extend, she
indicated that it was not her intention to back out as she wants the house,
even if delayed. She did note that
she would likely need to find alternate accommodation to address any extension.
 
16.  The Tenant indicated
that having to leave the rental unit on
short notice would cause him hardship, as he claims not to have
received the N12 until shortly before Christmas, and has in consequence only
been able to start considering other rental options. He asked for a few months to be able to find a new rental unit.
 
17.  In canvassing a hypothetical termination date around the end of April, both Ms. An and
the Tenant indicated that they could find that agreeable, and the Landlord’s
representative suggested that the Landlord could likely tolerate such a date.




 
 
 
18. 
Having regard to these
factors, and that an N12 is a
no-fault eviction application, I do not consider the request that the eviction
be delayed until
April to be an excessive request by the
Tenant. As the purchaser seemed
amenable to extending the transaction until that
time, and the
Landlord’s representative indicated acquiescence, I cannot consider the delay unfair when the evidence before
me is that the parties
to the sale transaction are amenable to an extension.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,528.88, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from November 15, 2021 to January 17, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $105.21
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 18, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The foregoing amounts
shall be offset
against rent payments
that have been made by the
Tenant for any rental periods that run from November 15, 2021 to date.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
