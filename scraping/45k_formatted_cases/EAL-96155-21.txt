Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-96155-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


A, 340 CARLETON STREET CORNWALL ON K6H4X7


 




Between:


Filippo Chiarenza


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Doug Johnson


Tenant



 
 
 
Filippo
Chiarenza (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Doug Johnson (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. ; because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person
 
This
application was heard in Passcode: 994 6973 8312# on September 29, 2021. Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s witnesses Kashtin Millett
and Kali Robidous, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant threatened his downstairs neighbour, then threw a 2 by 4 piece of lumber at
him from his balcony above at his neighbour, which narrowly missing hitting a
child.
 
2.    
The Tenant has spit at his neighbour and proceeded to throw scalding
hot water at his
neighbour which resulted in burns to the skin.
Police were called and the Tenant was charged.
 
3.    
Since the notice was served on the Tenant,
the Tenant continues
to verbally abuse other
tenants and has thrown things at others.
 
4.    
I find the Tenant has seriously
impaired the safety
of others in the residential complex.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
