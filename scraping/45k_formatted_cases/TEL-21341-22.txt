Durham Region Non Profit Housing
Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Cheryl Marcelo (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
he owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board
on September 8, 2021 with respect to application TEL-17789-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Board issued an order on consent pertaining to
file number TEL-17789-21 on September 8, 2021 which required the Tenant to make
regularly scheduled payments to the Landlord that were to be applied against
outstanding rental arrears. The agreement also
required the Tenant
to continue making
payments of lawful
rent for each consecutive
month in full, and on time throughout the month of October 2021.
 
2.    
The agreement provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
conditions specified in the order.
 
3.     Pursuant to subsection 78(5) of the Act, an application made under section
78 must be filed no later than 30 days after the
breach of the order.
 
4.     Within the subject
L4 application the Landlord claims
that the Tenant had not met the following condition as set out in the
order:
 
•        
Arrears payment due on September 3, 2021
 
5.    
The Landlord’s application was filed with the Board
on January 18, 2022, which,
pursuant to ss. 78 (5) of the Act, is more than 30 days after the Tenant
failed to meet a condition set out in the order of TEL-17789-21.




File Number: TEL-21341-22
 
6.    
The Board does not have jurisdiction to consider this application as it was filed beyond the statutory 30-day period after
the alleged breach had taken place.
 
 
7.     As the Landlord’s application does not meet the statutory requirements under subsections 78(5) of the Act, the application is
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
