Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02947-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


COOKSTOWN, 1 ALBERT
STREET INNISFIL ON L0L1L0


 




Between:


Dianne Hemmings
  William Hemmings


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Charlene Diana
  Chris Diana


Tenants



 
 
Dianne Hemmings and William
Hemmings (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chris Diana and
Charlene Diana (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 17, 2022. The Landlord
Dianne Hemmings and the Tenant’s attended the hearing
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 5, 2016 to
September 22, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The parties agree that the total amount
owing to January
31, 2022 is $13,421.00, which includes $13,235.00 in arrears of
rent, plus the $186.00 application filing fee.
 
6.     The Tenant’s testified that they fell into arrears of
rent because the Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on Tenant Chris Diana’s employment. Mr. Diana is a general contractor and
since the summer of 2021 his work has become slow due to the lockdowns and
restrictions. The Tenant Charlene Diana
is not employed and is the process
of applying for disability
benefits.




File Number: CEL-02947-21
 
 
 
7.    
The current household income
consists of Ontario
Works and Child Tax Benefits
totaling
$2,600.00. The Monthly rent is $1,560.00 and the Tenant’s
current living expenses
are approximately $1,550.00. The
Tenants have resided in the rental unit with their 3 children since 2016. The Tenant’s stated that once Mr. Dana
resumes regular working
hours, they will be in a position to pay the monthly rent, plus an additional
$400.00 towards the arrears of rent.
 
Relief from
eviction:
 
8.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
9.     The Tenant has paid no rent since July 2021, the
arrears of rent are substantial, and the Tenant’s own evidence indicates that
the current household income is less than the monthly rent being charged.
The Landlord is a non-corporate Landlord who relies
on the rental income to pay
the mortgage on the rental property.
 
10.  I am however mindful
that the Tenant’s
have 3 children and resided
in the rental unit for
approximately 6 years. As such, I
find delaying the termination date to March 15, 2022 reasonable to allow the
Tenants some additional time to secure alternate housing or to pay the arrears
owed.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $13,668.29*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$51.29 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




File Number: CEL-02947-21
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 15, 2022, then starting March 16, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)               
$14,981.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$16,541.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
