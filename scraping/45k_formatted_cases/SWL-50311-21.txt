of:


01, 242
CHRISTINA STREET S SARNIA ON N7T2N3


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Harry Anderson


Tenant



 
 
 
Mutual Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Harry Anderson (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 12, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord was in the Zoom hearing room at the time that I called
this matter for hearing.
The Landlord represented by Christine McDonald.
 
The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although he was properly
served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
The hearing notice that was sent
to the Landlord and the Tenant indicated that this application would be heard
via Zoom at 0900 on 17 January 2022. At
0945, the Tenant was not present in the Zoom hearing room and I granted the
Landlord’s application in his absence. The
Tenant appeared in the hearing room at approximately 1000. By that time, however, the Landlord had
already logged off. The Tenant
indicated that he had been trying to log into Zoom since 0830, but was having technological difficulties. I advised him that I had already granted
the Landlord’s application, but that he could seek to have my order reviewed. He argued with me for short period, then
swore at me and left the hearing.
 
I would not typically provide
extensive reasons in these circumstances, but I believe that it is appropriate
to provide some context for the benefit of the Tenant, in helping him to decide
whether to have my order reviewed. It is also appropriate
to explain the circumstances that have
resulted in me exercising my discretion and making a conditional order rather
than making the ‘standard order’ requested by the Landlord.
 
January 17, 2022, was not the first time that this application came before me for hearing.




 
The matter first came before me of hearing
on August 6, 2021. Notice
of that hearing was sent to
the parties in early-June of 2021.
 
The Tenant sent an e-mail to the
Board in July of 2021, after receiving the notice of hearing for the attendance on August 6, 2021, indicating that he did not understand the documents that had
been sent to him by the Board and that the Landlord’s application ‘had nothing
to do with him’.
He asserted in that e-mail that: (a) he had paid the lawful
rent in accordance with the applicable
tenancy agreement; and (b) he was not paying the (increased) rent being charged
by the Landlord because the Landlord had agreed to not increase
his rent. He further made assertions
with respect to being charged for the repair of a roof leak for which he was
not responsible.
 
The Tenant did not appear on August 6, 2021, and I indicated
to the Landlord that I would, as a
result, be granting the applications.
 
Unbeknownst to me when I heard
the application on August 6, 2021, on August 4, 2021, the Tenant had sent a
further e-mail to the Board asking that the hearing on August 6, 2021 be
adjourned. I did not see this e-mail
until after the hearing on August 6, 2021, but before I had made an order
granting the application. In light of
the Tenant’s e-mail and request for an adjournment, I determined that I would not make an order granting the Landlord’s application and would instead adjourn the hearing to be heard by me at a
later date. I ultimately scheduled a
hearing for November 12, 2021.1
 
It is my
understanding that the Tenant did not request any specific accommodation(s)
from the Board in connection with the hearing
of this application and did not respond to inquiries from the
Board as to what accommodations he required to participate in the hearing of
this application.2
 
I heard the matter via Zoom on
November 12, 2021. The Tenant was in
attendance at that hearing and fully participated. The hearing was, however, adjourned again for reasons
described below. I ultimately
rescheduled the matter for January 17, 2022.
 
Should the Tenant wish to review
this order, he should contact
the Board at 1-888-332-3234.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
April 1, 2017 to November 30, 2021. Because
of those arrears, the Landlord served an N4 notice with a termination date of
March 22, 2021, and then filed this application.
 
 
 












1 I note that the Tenant indicated to the Board that he
suffered a cracked collar bone in September of 2021 that resulted in mobility
issues, but did not respond
to a request from the Board that he advise when he expected that situation to be resolved so they
could accommodate his mobility issues when rescheduling the hearing.
2 The Tenant indicated, in response to inquiries from
the Board, that he did not have a home or mobile telephone. He indicated to me on January 17, 2021, that he did not have internet, although
he does have an e-mail
address and wants
communications from the Board to be made via e-mail. The Tenant did not respond to inquiries from the Board as to
whether he wanted to take advantage of a Public Access Terminal. The Board also provided him with contact
information for Legal Aid Ontario and the Law Society Referral Service.




 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $595.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2020 to
March 22, 2021.
 
3.     As noted above, the Tenant is paying rent. The Landlord asserts, however, that the
Tenant is (or was) ‘short-paying’ each month. It is my understanding that the difference between what the Tenant is (or
was) paying and what the Landlord asserts is the lawful rent for the unit
represents annual rent increases that the Landlord asserts are valid.
 
4.     The Landlord filed with the Board N1 notices in respect of rent increases from December of
2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the cumulative effect of which was to increase the
Tenant’s monthly rent from $545.00 to $595.00.
 
5.    
It is my understanding from the L1/L9 Information Update filed by the Landlord
for the purpose of the attendance on January 17, 2022, that:
(a) there has been another
rent increase and that current lawful rent is $602.00; (b) the Tenant
paid the Landlord
$5,526.81 in rent since the application was filed; and (c) the Tenant paid the Landlord
$$621.81 on January 1, 2022, which is in excess of the current
lawful rent
 
6.     It is my understanding from his e-mails to the Board
and the evidence he provided on November 12. 2021, that the Tenant asserts
that the Landlord
was (and is) not entitled
to increase the rent that he pays for the rental unit. Specifically, the Tenant asserts that when
he moved into the rental unit in 2015, there was an agreement by the Landlord
to fix the rent at $545.00 per month going forward and that there would be no
rent increases.
 
7.    
The relevant tenancy
agreement was not put before me by either party on November 12, 2021, and I adjourned
the hearing on that day so that the Landlord
could locate a copy of the tenancy agreement. I did that recognizing that section 3(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that the Act
applies despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary and the Divisional
Court has found that the subsection has the legal effect of rendering
an agreement by a landlord to not
increase rent ineffective. [See HOL-02048-17 (Re), 2018 CanLII 41854
(ON LTB)] I felt, however, that
it would be appropriate to have the tenancy agreement before me so that the
parties could make whatever argument they wished based on its terms.
 
8.     The tenancy agreement was not before me on January 17,
2022, and I was not able to hear from the Tenant. I believe, however, that I have sufficient information before
me with respect to the circumstances to make an informed decision
as to what order I should
make having regard to my obligation under section 83 of the Act to consider all
of the circumstances.
 
9.     I find, reluctantly, that the legal effect of
subsection 3(1) of the Act is that the Landlord is entitled to increase the rent payable
by the Tenant notwithstanding any agreement to the
contrary or waiver. I have, however,
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.




 
 
 
10.  As noted above, the Tenant is paying rent and the
dispute appears to relate to the fact that the Tenant understands that the
Landlord agreed that it would not ever increase his rent. The Landlord, for its part, appears to be
taking the position that, notwithstanding any agreement that might have been
made when the Tenant began to occupy the rental unit, it is legally
permitted to increase
the lawful rent in accordance with the Act. I am not
able to conclude that the Landlord is incorrect in taking the position that the
Act does not provide for the waiver
by a Landlord of its right to increase rent in accordance with the Act.
 
11.  In the circumstances,
I do not believe that it is unfair to grant
relief from eviction based
on the condition that the Tenant pays: (a) the arrears
owing based on the difference between the lawful rent and what he has paid; and (b) the full
lawful rent for the rental unit going forward for 12 months. I think it is also fair that the Tenant
reimburses the Landlord for the filing fee it paid in connection with this
application. I am making my order
subject to section 78 of the Act.
 
12.  I am providing the Tenant with what I find, in the circumstances, is a reasonable period to pay the
arrears owing to the Landlord. While
I appreciate that the Landlord is relying on its legal right to increase the
rent notwithstanding what agreement it might have made with the Tenant, I
cannot fault the Tenant for relying on what he believed was a binding agreement
on the part of the Landlord to not increase the rent.
 
13.  The Tenant should understand that what section
78 of the Act does is permit
the Landlord to obtain
an eviction order
from the Board without
providing him with prior notice if he fails to make any of the payments
required by my order. This means both the arrears and the full
lawful rent going-forward until March 1, 2023.
 
14.  I wish to be clear for the benefit of the Tenant that
I am not ordering that he can stop paying the full lawful rent after March 1, 2023, only that the ability
of the Landlord to apply for an eviction order without
notice to him will not apply to any failure to pay the full monthly will not
apply after March 1, 2023
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,222.59, which amount
is comprised of: (a)
$2,036.59 in outstanding rent arrears owing by the Tenant as of January
1, 2022; and (b)
$186.00 representing the fee to file this application, on or before
June 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
the lawful rent for the rental unit, which is currently
$602.00, as and when required by the applicable tenancy agreement for the period
of 12 months beginning
February 2022 and ending on March 1, 2023.
 
3.     If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in
accordance with this order, the outstanding balance of any arrears
of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order
shall become immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without
notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for




 
an order: (a) terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant; and (b) requiring
that the Tenant pay any new
arrears and related charges that became owing after January 1, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant
fails to pay to the Landlord the $2,222.59 as required by paragraph 1 of this order, then simple interest at 2% per
annum will begin to accrue on any outstanding balance beginning on July 1,
2022.
