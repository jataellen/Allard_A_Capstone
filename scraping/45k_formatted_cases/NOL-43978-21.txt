Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43978-21



In the matter
of:


2, 382 FISHER STREET NORTH BAY ON P1B2E1


 




Between:


John Miller


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Lizzie Mattinas


 
Tenant



 
 
John Miller
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lizzie
Mattinas (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 13, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Heather
Gibson, attended the hearing. As of 10:27
a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is $748.75.
4.    
The Tenant paid $1,450.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $725.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 18, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,002.40*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.62
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,097.25 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,846.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
