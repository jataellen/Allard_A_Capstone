In the matter
of:


52 DORLAND DRIVE NAPANEE ON K7R3K7


 




Between:


Grace Toomer Andrew Sturch,


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Selene
Williams


Tenant



 
 
 
Lorrie
Mccullough (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Selene Williams (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale
of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 1:45 PM
 
The Landlords, Grace Toomer and Andrew Sturch, and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlords were represented by Greg
Foss
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons set out below, I find that
the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation by his child. Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective March
31, 2022.
 
2.    
On August
19, 2021, the Landlord served
the Tenants with an N12 notice of termination
seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by
a purchaser. The termination date set out in the N12 notice is October 31,
2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
conceded that the Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one
month's rent prior to October 31, 2021 by waiving the rent for October 2021.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021.




 
6.    
As the sale transaction
closed on or about November 4, 2021, the application was amended at the hearing
to reflect that Grace Toomer and Andrew Sturch are now the
Landlords.
 
Good Faith
 
7.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section 49 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). Section 49(1)
requires that, in order to be successful in this application, the Landlords
must establish that at the time of the service of the N12 Notice, a purchaser
required, in good faith, the unit for residential use.
 
8.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle
was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the
Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also
have additional motives for selecting a particular rental unit, but this does
not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
9.    
The Landlords filed an
affidavit sworn by the person who personally requires the rental unit
certifying that the person in good faith requires the rental unit for his or
her own personal use. In oral
testimony at the hearing, the Landlords testified that they purchased the
rental unit to live closer to their work in Kingston. Given that the Tenant has failed to vacate as planned, the purchase transaction has closed, and the Landlords are temporarily living in
Belleville. Their four children are
split between locations in Belleville and Odessa.
 
10.  The Tenant did not substantively contest the good faith of the Landlord’s intentions.
 
11.  I therefore find that the Landlords in good faith require the rental unit for
residential purposes for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief from eviction
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
13.  The Tenant indicated
that she has experienced challenges finding new accommodations, having applied
to nearly 50 apartments since
August, without success.
She is on ODSP, and lives
with her 24-year-old son, who works in Kingston. She does not have other family she might move in with. She has asked for a delay until the end of
March 2022 to give her more time to find alternate accommodation.
 
14.  As noted above, the Landlords are
temporarily living in Belleville and commuting to work in Kingston. Two of their children live with them, the
other are staying Odessa. I have
regard to the fact that this is an inconvenience to the Landlords, and the
strain of having their children separated
is clear. I must however
have regard to the fact that, while it may




 
be inconvenient, the Landlords have alternate shelter
options available to them, whereas the Tenant does not, and the
application before me is a no-fault application.
Furthermore, the
Landlords (whether acting on their own counsel or relying on expert advice) close to enter into and close a purchase transaction in which vacant
possession of the property was not delivered on closing. I cannot
see that the Tenant’s reasonable
request for delay ought to be prejudiced by this transactional misadventure.
 
15.  The Tenant’s requested termination date is
not unreasonable in her circumstances, and while I am well aware that the delay will result in inconvenience to the Landlords and their loved
ones, I do not consider it to be an unfair imposition.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31, 2022.
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,595.78, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to January 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
Any amounts
already paid to rent shall be offset
against the foregoing amounts.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
