Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19571-21



In the matter
of:


223, 888 GLEN STREET OSHAWA ON L1J5Z4


 




Between:


Oshawa-Glen Developments Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jim Bolan Misty King


Tenants



 
 
 
Oshawa-Glen Developments Ltd.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Misty King and Jim Bolan (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 5, 2022. Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:54 a.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,030.47.
4.    
The Tenants paid $3,752.35
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,008.29 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from February
29, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and
whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $915.64*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $33.88
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,246.94 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,277.41 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
