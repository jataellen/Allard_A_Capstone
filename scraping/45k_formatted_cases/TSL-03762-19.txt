Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-03762-19










 

H.P.I.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict P.M
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 6, 2019. Only the Landlord’s
representative, J.S, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
The
Landlord’s application is amended to reflect that the rental periods covered by
this application start on February 1, 2019.
            
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant
owes the Landlord $11,332.52. In light of the circumstances disclosed at the
hearing, the termination date is extended to May 31, 2019. 
Tenant’s adjournment
request
2.      During
her testimony, the Tenant requested an adjournment. The Tenant testified that
she met with Tenant Duty Counsel that day and that was the first time she
received legal advice in this matter. The Tenant asked for more time to find
legal representation. The Tenant testified that prior to the hearing day, she
did not make any efforts to find legal representation. The Landlord opposed the
adjournment. 
3.      After
hearing from both parties, I denied the Tenant’s adjournment request. Based on
the Tenant’s evidence, I found that she did not make reasonable (or any)
efforts to find legal representation prior to the hearing, despite having
considerable notice of the proceeding. I also considered the prejudice to the
Landlord of postponing the matter. Given the significant amount of arrears
owing and the likelihood that they will increase if the hearing was postponed,
I found that the prejudice to the Landlord of delaying the hearing outweighed
the prejudice to the Tenant of proceeding that day. Accordingly, I denied the
adjournment and proceeded to hear the rest of the parties’ evidence and
submissions. 
The
Tenant owes the Landlord $11,332.52
4.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 25, 2019.
5.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
6.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $2,789.83.
7.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
8.      The
parties did not dispute the amount the Tenant owes. Therefore, I am satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant owes the Landlord $11,332.52,
including rent arrears to May 31, 2019 and the application filing fee.
9.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,789.83 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
10.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2016 to
February 25, 2019.
Section
83 considerations 
11.   The
Tenant testified that she accumulated the arrears owing as a result of her
marriage ending in 2016 and losing her job in December, 2017. The Tenant
testified that after losing her job, she lived off of her savings from the sale
of her matrimonial home. The Tenant testified that she has now used all of her
savings and she is living off of credit cards. The Tenant testified that she
currently has no income. The Tenant testified that she applied for Ontario
Works in December, 2018 but that application was denied because she had savings
at the time and was found to not be exhausting all of her sources of income.
Similarly, OW determined that she should also be seeking support payments from
her ex-husband, which she is in the process of doing. The Tenant testified that
she has applied again to OW but she does not know the status of that
application. The Tenant also testified that she has a court date in her family
law proceedings scheduled for June, 2019 and she is seeking support payments.
The Tenant testified that she is also looking for a job.  
12.   While
I am sympathetic to the Tenant’s situation as she has experienced a number of
setbacks over the past few years, I must also consider her ability to pay the
rent. Based on the Tenant’s evidence, I find that the Tenant cannot afford to
pay either the rent or the arrears. The Tenant does not have a confirmed source
of income and she is currently living off credit. This is not a sustainable way
of paying rent and I do not think it would be fair to either party to continue
the tenancy when it is more likely than not that the arrears, which are already
substantial will continue to grow. 
13.   At
the same time, I think it is appropriate to order a small extension of the
termination date to May 31, 2019 to allow the Tenant an opportunity to find
another place to live and/or to explore sources of emergency housing funds (one
of which she became aware of on the hearing day from Duty Counsel). Accordingly,
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 31, 2019
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 31, 2019.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,438.71*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 13, 2019, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $91.72 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 14, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May
31, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 1, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 31, 2019, then starting June 1, 2019,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2019.
8.      If,
on or before May 31, 2019, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,332.52** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after June 1, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
