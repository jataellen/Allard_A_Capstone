Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24919-21



In the matter
of:


717, 4220 STANTON AVENUE NIAGARA FALLS ON L2E3J9


 




Between:


Meeco East
Side Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Krystal Arneill


Tenant



 
 
Meeco East Side Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Krystal Arneill (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Adel Khalil, attended the hearing.
As of 3:28 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The notice of termination the Landlord provided
to the Board to support
their application contradicts
the date indicated when completing the filing process.
 
2.     A review of the notice
indicates the termination date to be September 6, 2021, and not
September 20, 2021 as the Landlord had claimed.
 
3.     This is problematic as the certificate of service included
indicates that the notice was served to the Tenant on September 6,
2021 as well.
 
4.     This did not provide the Tenant any period to remedy the notice and thus renders
the notice invalid.
 
5.    
I
acknowledge receipt of the Landlord’s unsolicited post hearing
submission however as a
decision was already made at the hearing which was based on the evidence
tendered by the Landlord I do not find it appropriate to accept the
submissions.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
