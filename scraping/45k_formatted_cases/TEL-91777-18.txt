M.F.I. (M.), L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict T.C. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 3, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, M.Z.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2017
to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 23, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending July 31, 2018, total $8,869.27. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed
for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,257.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to May 23, 2018, in
the amount of $8.87. 
6.     
The Tenant paid $1,287.00
after the application was filed.
7.     
The Tenant has been
persistently late in paying his rent. According to the information provided by
the Landlord’s representative, the Tenant has been late paying his rent 14 out
of 14 times since May 1, 2017. 
8.     
The Tenant lives in the
rental unit with a roommate and he has occupied the rental unit since
approximately May 2017. 
9.     
There is no dispute that,
while the Tenant is able to afford the rental unit, he cannot afford to pay the
substantial outstanding arrears. 
10.  
In light of the Tenant’s
pattern of late payment and in light of the Tenant’s inability to pay the
arrears, the Landlord’s representative was agreeable to a voidable order with a
termination date of July 31, 2017. In the event that the Tenant is able to void
the order by paying the outstanding arrears, the Landlord’s representative is
agreeable to an order requiring the Tenant to pay his rent on time, subject to
the Landlord’s right to file for an eviction order in the event of a breach. 
11.  
The Landlord’s
representative also suggested that, if the Tenant is able to void the order,
the requirement to pay on time should start with August’s rent due on August 10th
and any future rent will be due on or before the first day of each month. 
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until July 31, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act and it would not be unfair to impose the conditions suggested by the
Landlord’s representative. 
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 31,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,835.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $42.07 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 23, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 24,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 31, 2018, then starting August 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before July 31,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,059.27** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.   If the Tenant voids the eviction order for non-payment of rent
pursuant to paragraphs 8 or 9 above then the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new
rent on time and in full in accordance with the following schedule: 
a)    August’s rent shall be paid on or before August 10, 2018; 
b)    The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent in full on or before
the first day of each month for the period commencing September 1, 2018, to
July 31, 2010.  
11.   If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance
with paragraph 10 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pays any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after July 31, 2018.
