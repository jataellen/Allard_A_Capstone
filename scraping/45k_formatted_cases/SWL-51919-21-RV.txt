STREET
LONDON ON N6B3E8
 
Between:                  Able Property Management                                                                        Landlord

Review Order
 
Able Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nancy Jennings (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SWL-51919-21 issued on October
20, 2021.
 
On October 28, 2021, the
Tenant requested a review of the order because the Tenant believes they were not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing held on October 14, 2021
 
The request was heard by way of video
conference on October
14, 2021. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Daniel Abraham and
the Tenant attended the hearing. The
Tenant spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review Hearing
 
1.       
The Tenant testified that on
the day of the hearing,
she was not able to
attend because she had just
started back to work and could not get any time off. When the Tenant received the Notice of Hearing, she made a
request to the Board to have the matter rescheduled. The Tenant never received a response from the Board. The Tenant testified that she was unaware of the Board’s
process and did not she was supposed
to send someone to the hearing on her behalf.
 
2.       
I note, in the Board’s records,
there is a request to reschedule that was filed with the Board by the Tenant
on October 7, 2021. In the
request to reschedule, the Tenant
stated that she had just received the Board’s Notice of Hearing and that
she needs to




 
reschedule the hearing of October 14, 2021 because
she cannot get the time off work as
she just returned to work.
 
3.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted the Tenant ought
to have known about the hearing because she has arrears of
rent.
 
4.       
The case law from the Divisional
Court generally instructs that the meaning
of the phrase “not reasonably able to participate” should be interpreted broadly to ensure
natural justice and, where
a party shows that they genuinely
intended to participate in a hearing but was
prevented from so doing, then they should be entitled to a hearing through the
review process. However, this genuine intent to participate must be borne out
by the evidence, such as actions and conduct by the party, which clearly
demonstrate the party’s intent to participate in the hearing.
 
5.       
In Kathryn King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments 2008 CanLII 60708 (ON SCDC), the Divisional Court
stated: “Being reasonably able to participate in the proceeding must be
interpreted broadly, natural justice requires no less.” In King-Winton there
was evidence to suggest that the tenant missed her hearing because of her honest but mistaken belief in an incorrect hearing date. In that case, the tenant
mistakenly attended at the Board
on the wrong date to hear the Landlord’s application.
 
6.       
Here, the Tenant’s testimony is
consistent with the request to reschedule she filed on October 7, 2021 indicating she just returned
to work and could not get time off to attend
the hearing of October 14, 2021. Further,
the Tenant is unrepresented and gave evidence that she did not understand the
Board’s process as to what she should have done if she could not attend the
hearing herself. For these reasons, I
am satisfied that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the
hearing and the request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing
of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
7.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December
10, 2020.
 
8.       
The Tenant is possession of the rental
unit.
 
9.       
The lawful monthly rent as of November 1, 2020 is $766.00.
 
10.    The Landlord is not holding
a last month’s rent deposit.
 
11.    The Tenant paid $6,632.00
after the application was filed.
I note that this amount is what
the Tenant has calculated and what the Landlord accepted at the hearing in
order to resolve this matter. This is
the amount the Tenant has paid for the rental period of February 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. The Tenant provided
the Board and the Landlord with a copy of her calculation
of payments.
 
Tenant’s Evidence




 
12.   
The Tenant disputes the arrears of rent as calculated by the Landlord.
It is her position that
after making payment of $6632.00 the balance owed to the Landlord is $5,701.00.
The Tenant had no documents or receipts to support her claim of arrears owed to
the Landlord for the period of February 2020 to January 31, 2022.
 
13.    The Tenant testified that she fell behind on the rent payments because she lost her
job during the COVID-19 pandemic. She
has been back to work full time since July 2021 and is hoping she can pay the arrears of rent. She is also exploring assistance to repay the arrears of
rent from the Salvation Army and a local housing stabilization program.
 
14.    The Tenant does not want to move out of the rental
unit. She now has an income of
$890.00 biweekly. Her adult daughter has moved
in with her and is willing to assist with the
rent. The Tenant believes she can
repay the Landlord $525.00 a month until the arrears are paid. I note the Tenant is only will to pay the arrears she believes she owes
which is $5,701.00
 
15.    The Tenant said if she had to move out
of the rental unit, she would need at least 2
months to find alternate accommodations.
 
Landlord’s Submissions
 
16.   
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Tenant has not established that the arrears of rent as calculated by the Landlord
are incorrect. The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the rent
leger and math demonstrate that the Landlords calculation of the arrears of
rent are correct. The Landlord wants
the matter settled and has agreed to accept that the Tenant has paid more than
she actually has, which in turn reduces the actual arrears of rent owed to the
Landlord.
 
17.    The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the
Tenant has been working with income of approximately $1,780.00 a month, yet she
has not made a single full rent payment since that time. The Landlord’s Representative submitted that this is the second
arrears application the Landlord has brought to the Board with respect to the
Tenant, and the arrear have been accumulating for nearly 2 years. As such, the
Landlord wants the tenancy terminated, but is agreeable to delay the eviction date until the end
of January or February 2022.
 
Findings
 
18.   
In review of the parties’
evidence, I am satisfied that the arrears of rent owed for the rental period of February
2020 to January 31, 2022 is $10,842.00. This amount includes deducting the payments as
calculated by the Tenant in the amount of $6,632.00. I say this because it is a simple math calculation of adding up
all the rent for the months in question and deducting the Tenant’s payment.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
19.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to




 
postpone the eviction until February
20, 2022 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. In making
this finding, I considered the significant amount of the arrears owed to the
Landlord and that any further
delay in eviction may prejudice the Landlord as the arrears would most likely continue to
accumulate. I also considered the fact that the Tenant has been gainfully employed since July 2021 and yet has not made a full rent payment to the
Landlord. In my opinion this is
concerning and suggests that the Tenant does not have good faith intentions of
preserving the tenancy. I have
decided to postpone the date of eviction as I take judicial notice that at this
time, the province of Ontario is under restrictions due to the COVID-19
pandemic. As such, finding new housing
during this time may be difficult.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-51919-21 issued on October 20, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.

The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,576.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 20, 2022.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$25.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 21, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.

aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
