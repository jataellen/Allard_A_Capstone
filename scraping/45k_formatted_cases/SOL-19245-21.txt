Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-19245-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 68 WELLAND
AVENUE
ST. CATHARINES ON L2R2M7


 




Between:


Haddon Haynes Samuel Sandoval


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Tierra
Free


Tenant



 
 
 
Haddon Haynes and Samuel Sandoval (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Tierra Free (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on June 29, 2021 and
December 17, 2021. The Landlords’ legal representative, J. Tonnos, and the
Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlords’ witness, T. Balcombe, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1,
2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective November
19, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $896.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $896.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the
period from June 1, 2015 to November 19, 2020.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $9,856.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues
pursuant to section
82 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):
 
•        
Electricity for Kitchen/Bathroom;




 
•        
Carpet Sinkhole;
•        
Kitchen cupboard
and countertop;
•        
Draft at the Door;
•        
Paint cracking
and peeling;
•        
Bathroom Floor;
•        
Mold and Water Damage;
and
•        
Harassment
 
Electricity for Kitchen/Bathroom
 
7.    
The Tenant’s
position was that the way her electrical is set up in the kitchen and bathroom
was incorrect. She bases this on a telephone conversation with a person from
the fire department. She was advised that the GFCI plug in the bathroom
was shared with the oven vent
and continuously needed
to be reset. The Tenant
notified the Landlord
multiple times of this issue. The Landlord sent an electrician to the unit to update the outlets,
but they did not install GFCIs.
 
8.    
The Landlord’s position
was that there was no issue with the electricity in the kitchen and bathroom.
T. Balcombe, the Landlord’s property manager, testified
that an electrician was called, and no issues were
found. Submitted into evidence was an invoice from an electrician dated May 28,
2021 for an inspection and no code violations were found.
 
9.    
On a balance of
probabilities, I do not find that the Landlords were in breach of their
maintenance obligations pursuant
to section 20 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). Section 20 requires
a landlord to maintain the unit in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and comply with health, safety
and maintenance standards. The Tenant has not
led sufficient evidence to establish that the Landlords were in breach. The
telephone call with the fire department alone, without any reports or orders
for compliance, for example, does not persuade
me that there was any issue with the electricity. As such, this portion of the Tenant’s section 82 issues is
dismissed.
 
Carpet Sinkhole
 
10.  The Tenant’s position
was that she has a giant sinkhole
in her carpet greater than two feet long. She notified the Landlords of this issue multiple times. However, the Landlords never addressed it. The Landlords’
position was that there was no issue with the carpet.
 
11.  On a balance of probabilities, I do not
find that the Landlords were in breach of their maintenance obligations
pursuant to section 20 of the Act. The Tenant’s testimony alone does not
persuade me that there was an
issue with the carpet. The Tenant
did not submit sufficient documentary
evidence, in the form of photographic evidence, for example, to persuade me
that the carpet had a sinkhole. As such, this portion of the Tenant’s section
82 issues is dismissed.
 
Kitchen Countertop and Cupboards




 
12.  The Tenant submitted that the kitchen
cupboards did not close properly,
and the countertop tiles cracked and popped out. The Tenant notified
the Landlords of this issue
in two emails. Submitted into evidence were photographs of the kitchen
countertop tiles with one photograph showing a tiny crack.
The Tenant also submitted into evidence photographs of the kitchen cabinets. The Tenant submitted that the issue
remains today.
 
13.  The Landlords’ position
was that there were no issues with the kitchen
cabinets, other than the knobs being slightly loose and a mold issue under the sink that was
remedied on May 5, 2020.
 
14.  On a balance of probabilities, I do not
find that the Landlords were in breach of their maintenance obligations
pursuant to section 20 of the Act. The photographs do not demonstrate any
issues of lifting of the countertop tiles. While there was one photograph
demonstrating a tiny crack, I do not find the Landlords should be found to be in breach for this very minor cosmetic
issue. I also do not see any issues with the cupboard
doors closing based on the
photographs submitted. As such, this
portion of the Tenant’s section 82 issues is dismissed.
 
Draft at the Door
 
15.  The Tenant’s position was that there is a draft near the front door.
The Tenant notified the Landlords on multiple occasions of
this issue. While the Landlords sent someone to address the issues various
times, the issue is still outstanding, and the draft travels up to the living
room and it feels as if it is below freezing in the wintertime.
 
16.  The Landlords’ position was that they had
been timely in their response. They had sent a maintenance person to seal off
the air duct to make it airtight, sealed off and did weather stripping at the front door and then installed a
vent for hot air to enter the front
area of the home. Work orders were submitted into evidence substantiating the
work done, with the last work order being December 15, 2020.
 
17.  In the case Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management, 2016 ONCA 477 (Onyskiw) (CanLII), the Court of Appeal for Ontario
determined that a contextual approach
should be adopted when considering a landlord’s potential
breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act and a breach will not be found if the
landlord’s response to a maintenance issue was reasonable in the circumstances.
Therefore, simply because there had been a draft at the rental unit, does not
automatically amount to a breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act by the
Landlords.
 
18.  The evidence before the Board was that the
Landlords had a timely response to the Tenant’s complaints of each draft. While
the Tenant disputes the adequacy of the Landlords’ response because the issue
is still outstanding, I am not persuaded that it is. The Tenant did not direct me to any correspondence after December 15, 2020 notifying
the Landlords of this issue. Further,
the Tenant did not prove, by submitting video evidence of a draft coming
through or a temperature reading,
for example, that the
draft is outstanding after the Landlords’ repairs.
 
19.  On the evidence before me, I find that
the Landlords’ responses to address the draft were reasonable in these
circumstances. Consequently, in accordance with Onyskiw, I am not




 
satisfied that the Landlords breached
subsection 20(1) of the Act by failing
to maintain the rental unit as the Landlords acted reasonably and responded when advised that there was a problem.
 
Paint cracking and peeling
 
20.  The Tenant’s position
was that the paint in the living
room, kitchen and bathroom has began
to chip and crack. The Tenant reported
this to the Landlords on August 2, 2020. Submitted into evidence were photographs taken in May 2021 of the paint
peeling in various
areas of the home.
 
21.  The Landlords submitted that they responded to the Tenant’s
issues regarding the chipping
on the bathroom door on October 12, 2020. The peeling of the bathroom ceiling
was addressed on September 14, 2021.
 
22.  Based on the photographs and the
Tenant’s email to the Landlord
dated August 2, 2020, I find that the Landlords are in breach of
his maintenance obligations. While the Landlords submitted that they addressed
the Tenant’s complaints regarding the paint
chipping on the bathroom door and ceiling,
they did not lead evidence
regarding what was done to address
the other areas. The photographs demonstrate that the paint issue is still outstanding. The Tenant is entitled to a remedy, which
shall be addressed in the remedies section below.
 
Bathroom Floor
 
23.  The Tenant’s position was that the flooring
in the bathroom had holes and had split. The Tenant notified the Landlords on multiple occasions of this issue. The Tenant
testified that she made this issue
known to the Landlords during a walkthrough. She formally made the property manager aware of this issue on February
25, 2020 via text message.
Photographs were submitted into evidence before the repairs were
completed, showing peeling tiles behind the bathtub. Repairs to the floor commenced November 4, 2020.
 
24.  The Landlords’ position was that they were
not aware of the bathroom floor issue until a maintenance person
came to the unit to address other issues. Once the property
manager was aware of the issue, he sought permission from the Landlords
to undertake the repair which was approved on October 22, 2020 and the
materials were ready beginning November 2020. The issue repairs began November
4, 2020 and were completed on November 10, 2020.
 
25.  On a balance
of probabilities, I find that the Landlords
were in breach of their maintenance
obligations. I prefer the Tenant’s believable and credible evidence that she
notified the Landlords of this issue through their property manager on February
25, 2020 via text message. The issue was not remedied until November 4, 2020. I find that the lapse in time in
addressing this issue to be unreasonable. The Tenant is entitled to a remedy,
which will be addressed in the
remedies section below.
 
Mold and Water
Damage




 
26.  The Tenant submitted that she discovered a
mushroom on the floor of the bathroom floor on September 27, 2020. On November
4, 2020, a contractor attended to replace the bathroom floor. During this time, she witnessed the contractor remove
multiple flooring tiles covered in mold. She also observed
mold coming up the wall. She brought this to the Landlords’ attention on
November 4, 2020 via text message. When she realized the Landlords were not
going to address the mold issue, she paid for a mold specialist from AirAware Building
Science and Diagnostics Inc. to attend
the unit. Submitted
into evidence was a Mold
Assessment Report dated May 31, 2021. The report states that a tape lift sample
found that, “the mold spores collected within the bathroom are indicative of
water impacted materials and may pose a respirable hazard to the apartment
occupants.” Included were remediation recommendations. The Tenant submitted
that the mold was hazardous. She notified the Landlords of this issue via email
on May 31, 2021.
 
27.  The Landlords submitted that the mold issue
was merely surface mold which was addressed after the Tenant requested that a
by-law inspector attend her unit to address the mold in her bathroom. By way of
compliance order issued August 19, 2021, the Landlords were ordered to ensure
the bathroom ceiling is clean and free of any moisture and resulting
mold/fungus growth; properly sand, scrape, prime and paint the bathroom
ceiling, so it is free of loose
paint or other loose material
and it is maintained in good repair; and properly caulk and seal
around the tube so it is in a water tight condition.
The Tenant denied the Landlords access to repair the issues as she felt the
compliance order was insufficient. The work was completed on September 14, 2021
after the Tenant permitted access.
 
28.  On a balance
of probabilities, I find that the Landlords were in breach of their maintenance
obligations. While the Tenant may have notified the Landlords of finding a
mushroom on February 27, 2020 and stated she witnessed mold on November 4,
2020, the Tenant did not have confirmation that what she observed was in fact
mold. However, the Landlords received confirmation of such from AirAware on May 31, 2021. The Landlords did not take any action until a compliance order
was received by the City.
 
29.  While the Tenant was not satisfied with the
work ordered by the City, I find that this compliance order was issued in
accordance with the most current and identifiable issues in the unit. The
uncontested evidence was that the Landlord completed the work in accordance with the City’s order. While the Tenant states the issue is still outstanding, I am not persuaded
that it is. The Tenant led no evidence that the City found the Landlords did
not comply with the order
or require the Landlord to inspect the property for possible mold thereafter.
 
30.  It is important
to note that the Tenant
denied the Landlords’ attempts to address
the issues after August
19, 2021 until the completion of work on September 14, 2021. However, I find that the lapse in time between the report and the day the
Landlords could have remedied the situation to be unreasonable. Therefore, I
find the Landlords failed to comply with health, safety and maintenance
standards. As such, I find a remedy should be awarded, which will be addressed
in the remedies section below.
 
Harassment




 
31.  The Tenant
submitted that the night before the Tenant had a mold report, she was
served with an N5 due to her garbage
overflowing. The Landlords’ property manager
testified this was served in
response to the garbage issue on the exterior of the Tenant’s unit and disputed
this constitutes harassment.
 
32.  Section 23 states that a landlord shall not
harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with a tenant. Those terms are
not defined in the RTA.
 
33.  The Ontario Human Rights Code defines
"harassment" as: engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct
that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome. I do not find that the service
of the N5 constitutes harassment. A landlord may exercise their rights under the Act to
serve notices on a tenant in response to issues. I do not find that the service
of one notice constitutes harassment.
 
REMEDIES
 
34.  The Tenant was seeking an abatement of rent
and an order requiring the Landlords to do the outstanding work.
 
35.  An abatement is a contractual remedy. It
recognises the idea that a tenant is paying rent for a bundle of goods and services and if the tenant is not
receiving everything being paid for
then he is entitled to abatement proportional to the difference between what is
being paid for and what is being received. There is no guidance in the Act to
assist the Member in determining the amount of an abatement of rent. The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 5 provides some guidance
on rent abatement. In determining
the amount to be ordered, the Member will consider the period of
time that the problem existed and the severity of the problem in terms of its
effect on the tenant. The test should be the impact on the average tenant or
the impact a reasonable person would expect this problem to have had on a tenant.
 
Paint cracking and peeling
 
36.  The Tenant requested a 5% rent abatement
from September 2020 to December 2020. I am of the view that a reasonable
abatement of the rent with respect to a problem that is essentially aesthetic
in nature only is about 1% of the
rent charged. The Landlord will also
be ordered to repair the peeled paint
in the unit in the kitchen
and living room. The arrears are offset by $35.66 ($896.00 x
12 / 365 x 121 days x 1%).
 
Bathroom Flooring
 
37.  The Tenant requested
rent abatement of 10% from February 2020 to December
2020 and for the Landlord to
fix the flooring, install a tub spout and caulk to tub properly. I find that 5%
rent abatement from June 20, 2020 to November 4, 2020 to be reasonable in the
circumstances. The Tenant
filed her list of section
82 issues in response to the Landlords’ arrears application on June 20, 2021. Pursuant to section 29 of the Act, the Board only has
authority to award a remedy one year prior to the date the Tenant filed these
issues, or June 20, 2020.
I fix the amount of abatement to 5% in consideration of the disruption to the Tenant as her evidence
was that the floors were warped and splitting. The Tenant’s request




 
to repair the floor and caulk
the tub and wall is denied given that it was uncontested these issues were already addressed. In regard to the tub spout,
there is insufficient evidence that this spout is required. The arrears are
offset by $201.80 ($896.00 x 12 / 365 x 137 days x 5%).
 
Mold
 
38.  The Tenant was seeking 60% rent abatement from October to December 2020 and full rent
abatement from January to June 2021. I find that 20% rent abatement from May 31, 2021 to August
19, 2021 for the mold issue is reasonable and appropriate. As discussed above, the Landlords were in breach when the Landlords
received confirmation of mold and when
they could have remedied it. I fix this amount at 20% in consideration of the
disruption to the Tenant from the date an official mold report was forwarded to
the Landlords and their lack of response. Even after receiving
the mold assessment report, the Landlords made no effort to have
the unit inspected
by a professional. They waited until the
Tenant contacted the City to try and remedy the situation.
 
39.  While the Tenant’s
written submissions comment
on the impact of the mold on her and her
family’s health, insufficient evidence was led for me to conclude
that the mold caused these health conditions. The Mold
Assessment Report merely states that the mold may cause respiratory
issues. While the Tenant submits that
the report states the mold is hazardous, I do not find that this is the case. The report
found that traces of different types of mold in the bathroom were “high”
and “moderate”; however,
the report does not explicitly state that these
types are hazardous. As such, I cannot make this inference. The arrears are
offset by $471.36 ($896.00 x 12 / 365 x 80 days x 20%).
 
40. 
The Tenant
is entitled to an
abatement of rent of $708.82.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
41.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
42.  It was undisputed that a payment plan was
not discussed as the Tenant’s issue was regarding maintenance issues. The
Tenant submitted that she intentionally withheld rent due to the maintenance issues in her home. This is not a positive
consideration. However, the
Tenant had paid the rent in full after the application was filed. The Tenant’s
evidence was that if she were required to pay off the arrears, she would be
able to do it within a month’s time. As the arrears have been offset by the
abatement ordered, I believe the Tenant will be able to pay off the outstanding arrears within the standard eleven-day voiding period.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlords $1,526.66*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 18, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlords
owe the Tenant.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$29.46 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 29, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January 30, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 30, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 29, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,165.18** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 30,
2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
 
Section 82
 
10.  The Landlords are required to
repair the peeling paint in the
kitchen and living room on or before February 15, 2022. If the Landlords fail
to do so by February 15, 2022, the Tenant is authorized to arrange for the
repair to be done and may recover the cost by deducting the amount from the rent
paid in the months after the repair or replacement is done until there is no
longer any money owing. The Tenant shall provide the Landlords proof of her expenses.
