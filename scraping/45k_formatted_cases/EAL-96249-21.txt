In the matter of:      309, 7 BRICELAND STREET

Ashton Roen Doyle Zachary Robert
Harvey


Tenants




 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Zachary Robert Harvey
and Ashton Roen Doyle (the
'Tenants') to pay the rent that they owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on September 28, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Adelina Andreita,
the Landlord’s witness, Bradley Casnaw, and the Tenant, Ashton Doyle, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants did not pay the total rent they were required
to pay for the period from
March 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated the rental unit on September 10,
2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed. While the Tenants state that they vacated the rental
unit on August 3, 2021 and returned the keys on that day, the Tenant provided
insufficient evidence to prove this on a balance of probabilities.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,382.65.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a last month's rent deposit of
$1,382.65 and that amount is still being held by the Landlord. Interest, in the amount of $12.75, is owed on the last month's
rent deposit for the period February 5, 2021 to August 10, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     The NSF cheque charges were not substantiated at the hearing.
Therefore, the claim was
denied.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: EAL-96249-21
 
 
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,275.82, which
represents the amount of rent owing up to September 10, 2021 less the last month's rent deposit and interest owing on
the last month's rent deposit.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
