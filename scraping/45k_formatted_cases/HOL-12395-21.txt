140 Main St. Holdings

tenancy and evict Tanasa Tyler and Barrington McFarlane (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Isabelle McNelly, attended
the hearing. As of 1:35 p.m. the Tenants were not present or

were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on January
26, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.     
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 was
$2,143.60.
4.     
The Tenants paid $2,118.20 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,143.60 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.

Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenants up December 31, 2021.
