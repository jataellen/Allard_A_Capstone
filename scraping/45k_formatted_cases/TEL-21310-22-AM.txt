This amended order is issued to correct a
clerical error in the original order. The correction has been bolded
and underlined, with deletions marked
as struck-through text, for ease of reference.
 
On January 6, 2022, Joanne Perrier (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Candace Washington (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
January 31, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental unit by
the termination date set out in the agreement.
 
2.    
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
