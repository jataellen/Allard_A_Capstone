Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wayne Bouchard (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Michelle Twiss, attended the hearing. As of 10:47 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
1, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $40.00
for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
3.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
13, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,561.22.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,561.22 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 4, 2021 to September 1, 2021.




File Number: SOL-24789-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
13, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,337.98*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 13, 2021 and
the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord
by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
