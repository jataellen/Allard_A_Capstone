Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05465-18
 
 
MM (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
The application was amended to include only the
above-named as Tenants IM, AM, TB and ZC.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on September 11,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent, TM, and the
Tenant, IM, attended the hearing.
 
This matter was first heard on
July 3, 2018.  The Tenants had a number of issues they wished to raise pursuant
to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  The
matter was adjourned in order to provide the Tenants an opportunity to disclose
all the section 82 issues.  An interim order was issued that ordered the
Tenants to pay the full rent commencing August 1, 2018, and going forward, no
later than the first day of each respective month, until all issues are
resolved between the parties.  The Tenants failed to disclose all their section
82 issues, and did not pay the full rent, commencing August 1, 2018.  Given the
Tenant’s failure to disclose all section 82 issues pursuant to the Interim
Order, the matter proceeded on the issue of arrears only. 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 31, 2015 to September 24,
2018.
 
4.     
The Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order.  The Landlord’s agent, (TM), said that the Landlord
has provided the Tenants many opportunities to pay the arrears.  He said the
parties have a history of coming before the Board, and that as soon as one pay
on time order was finished, the Tenants were very soon in arrears again.  The
Tenants now owe a substantial amount of arrears, and the Landlord is seeking a
standard termination order before the arrears increase even further.
 
5.     
The Tenant (IM), said that
she has been living in the rental unit with different family members for three
years.  She said that her two sons, a sister and a niece will now be living
permanently in the rental unit, and will all be contributing towards the rent
payments.  IM said that some of her other family members who lived with her did
not contribute to the rent as they had promised, and that is why the rent
arrears accumulated to such an extent.  IM said that her two sons, AM, and ZC,
are now both working and contributing towards the rent.  IM said she is now “in
charge” of collecting the full rent, and suggested that she would now be able
to meet a payment plan in which she would pay the rent on time going forward,
and then $700.00 towards arrears every month. 
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants have
barely made any payments towards the rent for six months.  They also failed to
meet the conditions of the interim order that was issued over two months ago,
ordering them to pay the full rent on time.  IM did not bring any evidence to
demonstrate that there have been any significant changes to the Tenants’
circumstances that would ensure the Landlord that the Tenants could meet the
terms of the payment plan proposed.  In addition, the proposed payment plan
would take over a year to be paid in full.  There is severe prejudice to the
Landlord in permitting the arrears to accumulate further.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The Landlord, upon receipt of this order, must give a copy of this
order to the Tenants by a method set out in subsection 191 (1) of the Act,
other than by sending it by mail or courier to
the last known address where the Tenants reside or carry on business.
 
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before October
5, 2018.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $6,293.12*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to September 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
September 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 5, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 5, 2018, then starting October 6, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 6, 2018.
 
9.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $8,890.00 if the payment is made on or before September 30, 2018, or
ii)       $10,790.00 if the payment is made on or before October 5, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 6, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
