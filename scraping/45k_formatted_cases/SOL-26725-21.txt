Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26725-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


115, 286 CUSHMAN ROAD ST. CATHARINES ON L2M6Z2


 




Between:


Rene Zamai
Sylvia Vicere Zamai


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Garvin Villafana


Tenant



 
 
 
Rene Zamai and Sylvia Vicere
Zamai (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Garvin Villafana (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
December 14, 2021 with respect to application SOL-24265-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay the lawful rent for
December on or before December 8, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$9,975.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-24265-21-AM. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$9,975.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-24265-21-AM is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




File Number: SOL-26725-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous order SOL-24265-21-AM is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $11,875.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and
the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $62.47
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
