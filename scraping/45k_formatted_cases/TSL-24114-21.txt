Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24114-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


4, 1301 BLOOR
STREET W TORONTO ON M6H1P1


 




Between:


Adenat
  Incorporated


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Duran Wilson


Tenant



 
 
Adenat Incorporated (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Duran Wilson (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Crystal Do Couto, attended the hearing. As of 11:07 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 20, 2021
to January 19, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,875.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,875.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from October 20, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $9,114.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 14, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $61.64 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 25, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January 26, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 26, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$11,436.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 19, 2022, or
ii)             
$13,311.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 25, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
