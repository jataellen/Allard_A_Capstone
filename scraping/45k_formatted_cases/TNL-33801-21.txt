In the matter
of:


1604, 320 DIXON ROAD ETOBICOKE ON M9R1S8


 




Between:


Mohammad Owais


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Ahmed Mohamed Abdulahi


Tenant



 
Mohammad Owais (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ahmed Mohamed Abdulahi (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on November
18, 2021.
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative Cuien (aka Wendy)
Hu, the Tenant and the
Tenant's Legal Representative Vijay Shah attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a) 
the landlord,
(b) 
the landlord’s spouse,
or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.     On July 7, 2021 the Landlord
sent to the Tenant via mail to the address
of the rental unit a (N12)
Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord requires possession of
the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by a parent of the Landlord.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice
was September 30, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the
notice given.




 
6.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of the
Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
7.    
The Landlord stated that the compensation was paid to the Tenant in an amount equal to one month’s rent by bank draft payable to the Tenant dated September
10, 2021 and was
sent to the address of the rental unit by registered mail on September 14,
2021.
 
8.     The Landlord filed a Declaration sworn by Javid Iqbal
the father of the Landlord affirming that he in good faith personally require
the rental unit for
his own personal use for at least one-year period.
 
9.     The Tenant's Legal Representative disputes the good
faith intentions of Javid Iqbal moving into the rental unit based on his physical
disabilities, and attempted
to raise other issues that I determined were not
relative to the type of application that has been filed.
 
10.  The Tenant's Legal Representative also purports that the compensation as of the date of the hearing has not been received by
the Tenant.
 
11.  The Landlord's Legal
Representative has submitted
to the Board a copy of a bank draft payable to the Tenant dated September
9, 2021, asserting it was sent to the Tenant via registered mail. Documentation from
Canada Post shows that registered mail was sent and received by the Tenant.
 
12.  At issue is a determination whether compensation has been provided
to satisfy Section
55.1 of the Act.




 
13.  Section 191(1) of the Act states -
When a landlord serves a document
to a tenant in accordance with one of the permitted methods set out in
subsection 191(1) of the Act or Rule 3 of the Board’s Rules, there is no
concomitant obligation on the Landlord
to prove the tenant actually
received the document.
 
Rule 3.1 5). lists one of the permissible methods of service
to be
•        
served by sending
it by mail to the address where the tenant
or former tenant
resides:
 
14.  Section 191(1) of the Act also
states - A notice or document is sufficiently given
to a person other than the
Board,
(f) by sending it by mail to the last known address where the person resides or carries on business and is deemed served five (5)
days after mailed.
 
15.  Based on the testimonies given
and the documentary evidence provided, on a balance
of probabilities, I was satisfied
that all the technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act
were met.
 
16.  The Landlord's Legal Representative requested
a standard order
to terminate the tenancy.
 
17.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord's Legal Representative provided
a copy of a letter from the
Rekai Centre that Mr. Javid Iqbal was a former resident of that Long-Term
care facility and confirms that Mr. Iqbal was given notice of discharge for
reasons cited therein. Mr. Javid Iqbal gave testimony that he currently resides
in a temporary shelter waiting to take possession of the rental unit.
 
18.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,520.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020.
 
19.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
4.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
