Simcoe Property
Management A Division
Of 975221 Ontario
Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew Thomas Eric Stockley and Alicia
Marjorie Sylvia Broderick (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently
late in paying their rent.
The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 922 1637 8430#
on September 2, 2021. The Landlord’s
representative Adeela Alvez, and the Tenant Matthew Thomas Eric Stockley,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due. The Tenants
moved into the rental unit in February 2019 and have been paying rent late
since May 2019.
 
2.    
The Tenants currently
owe the Landlord $8,693.24. The
Landlord entered into an agreement for the Tenants to pay what they owe over time and this agreement has been
breached.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from January 28, 2019 to January 31, 2021




 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated, as of January
21, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $20,053.71, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from February 1, 2021 to January 10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $63.50 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 11, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
