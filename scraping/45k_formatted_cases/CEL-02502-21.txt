Between:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Cage Reed Paige Teachout


Tenants



 
 
 
Carolyn Magee
and Jack Lewis (the 'Landlords') applied (L2 Application) for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Cage Reed and Paige Teachout (the 'Tenants')
because they have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate
the Landlords for the damage; and because they have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
Carolyn Magee
and Jack Lewis (the 'Landlords') applied (L1 Application) for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Cage Reed and Paige Teachout (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants failed to pay rent that they owe. The Landlords and the Tenants
filed a written
payment agreement with the Board on September 1, 2021 to resolve the
Landlords' application.
 
Both applications were heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord, Jack Lewis, the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Suzanne
Cornish, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s L1 Application
 
1.    
The Landlords
and the Tenants filed a written Payment
Agreement with the Board on September 1, 2021 to resolve the
Landlords' application.
 
2.    
The agreement
reached by the Landlords and the Tenants
resolves the subject-matter of the Landlords' application.




 
3.    
The agreement
has been signed
by the Landlords and the Tenants.
 
4.    
The agreement
was filed with the Board before the hearing of the Landlords' application commenced.
 
5.    
At the time of the hearing,
this payment agreement had already started
as payments are currently being made by the Tenants.
 
6.    
As a result of this agreement, the hearing scheduled
for December 16, 2021 for this
application has been cancelled as the matter has been settled with the payment
agreement already in place.
 
Landlord’s L2 Application
 
7.    
On July 13, 2021, the
Landlords served the Tenants an N5 Notice of Termination (N5) with a
termination date of August 31, 2021. This was the first N5 notice served to the
Tenants which allowed the Tenants
to be able to void the N5 notice if they corrected their behaviour and paid $2,400.00 for damages caused to the
rental unit within 7 days of being served.
 
8.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
9.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,400.00.
 
10.  The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
11.  Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 1, 2019 to August 31, 2021.
 
12. 
The Landlords’ Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenants
are responsible for the
following:
(a) 
On or about March 25, 2020, the Landlords were notified by the condo board by letter
of the Tenants parking in areas not designated for their use. The Tenants
promised to remedy this.
 
(b) 
On or about May 1, 2020, the Landlords were again notified
by the condo board of the
parking rules being broken.
 
(c)  On or about September 28, 2020, the Landlords were notified by condo board of the Tenants encroaching on common areas
with kid’s toys impeding landscapers from doing their job. Tenants were
notified by Landlords.




 
(d)  On or about February
4, 2021, the Landlords were notified by condo board of Tenants parking their vehicles in the
fire lane. The Tenants were also operating snowmobiles which are strictly
prohibited in the complex.
 
(e)  On or about April 21,
2021, the Landlords were notified by condo board that the Tenants installed a
chain link fence in the common area of the complex without permission. The chain link fence was ordered taken down, however,
the posts still remained as they were anchored in
cement. The posts were to be removed and ground repaired at Tenants expense.
 
(f)  
On or
about June 26, 2021, the Landlords were notified by the condo board of the
Tenants having a party on June 19, 2021. There were many complaints regarding
multiple vehicles parked in the common areas, loud music and foul language into
the early morning hours.
The superintendent also complained of the garbage that was not
cleaned up. There are multiple
complaints from other residents regarding
the Tenants’ actions
interfering with their rights to quiet enjoyment of their homes and common
elements and the condo board wants the Tenants to cease and desist and not
repeat these behaviours. There was also an offensive banner hanging from the
Tenants residence which the Tenants were ordered to remove.
 
(g)  On or about July 7, 2021, the Landlords discovered the front
door along with the locks had been changed by the Tenants
without permission. This leaves the Landlords without a key to their property
which is contrary to s.34 [repair of damages] and s.35(1) [changing locks] of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006. The Landlords asked the
Tenants for a key to be provided,
or the original door and lockset be re-installed at the Tenants’ expense. The Tenants have
not complied.
 
(h)  On or about July 6, 2021,
the Landlords performed a
walk-through inspection of the rental unit. There were many areas of physical
damage and pictures of each of the damages were submitted as evidence to the
Board. The damages included the master bedroom door frame, the small bedroom
door, the bathroom sink, the bathroom wall, the bathroom cabinet, the hallway
wall, the kitchen wall and baseboard, the kitchen
ceiling, the basement
wall, the basement
stairs wall, and the
wall by the front door. The total damages to the rental unit total $2,400.00. The
Landlords also reported dangerous clutter in three separate areas that were a
potential fire hazard.
 
(i)    The Landlord’s Legal
Representative also added that when the Tenants moved in they asked Landlords
to allow one pet, a small family dog. However, since then that dog appears
to be gone and has been replaced
with another dog, a cat and two fully
grown rabbits. This was done without the consent of the Landlords and violates
the rules of the condo board.




 
 
 
13.  The Landlord, Jack Lewis, then submitted that the condo corporation is currently
seeking legal action against the Landlords due to the constant bad behaviour of
the Tenants. He stated that he has been patiently trying to work with Tenants
for almost two years but he is being threatened with losing ownership of his property
due to the amount of complaints
and that Landlords are deemed responsible for their Tenants’ actions.
 
14.  At the hearing,
the Tenants could not provide
sufficient explanations or any evidence
of their own to counter any of the Landlords’ evidence.
 
15.  The Landlords’ Legal Representative stated that due to the actions of the Tenants
and the fact the Tenants have
not rectified their behaviour as well
as the Tenants have not paid
for the damages they are responsible for, the Landlords are seeking to evict
the Tenants.
 
Findings
 
16.  On the balance of probabilities, I find
that the Tenants’ behaviour has substantially interfered with Landlords’
reasonable enjoyment and lawful rights regarding the rental unit. I also find that the Tenants’ actions
have caused the Landlords to be at risk of losing
their property within the condo corporation.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
17.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
This would allow the Tenants the time to find another place to live.
 
18.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords
and the Tenants is terminated, as of February 28, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The remaining balance owing on the Payment
Agreement (from the L1 Application) filed with the Board on September 1, 2021 shall become payable
on February 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $2,400.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlords $4,413.18, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from September 1, 2021 to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $46.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 6, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.




 
6.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before
February 28, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
