In the
  matter of:


70, 1 BECKENROSE COURT BRAMPTON ON L6Y6G2


 




Between:


Michael Gubran


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Youssef
  Hanna


Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Gubran
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Youssef Hanna (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Shayan
Kamalie, the Tenant,
and the Tenant’s
Legal Representative, Michael Zakhari, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On July 7, 2021, the Landlord
served the Tenant with an N12 Notice
of Termination (N12) with a termination date of September
30, 2021. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Landlord
requires the rental unit for residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord paid the
Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on August 12, 2021. However,
due to etransfer password issues
the funds had to be resent on August
17, 2021. At the hearing, the Tenant still stated that he had issues receiving
the funds online and was not really sure how to get them. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative added that a certified cheque will given to the Tenant instead.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$2,040.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
Good Faith
 
5.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section
48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 48(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlord




 
must establish
that at the time of the service
of the N12 he required,
in good faith, the unit for residential use.
 
6.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where the Court held that the “good faith” requirement
simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The
Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.
 
7.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the
motives of the Landlord are, per
Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of
the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy
the property.
 
8.    
The Landlord
was recently married
and wants to move into the rental unit with his new wife. He is currently renting a unit
elsewhere until he can move into his own property.
 
9.    
At the hearing, the
Tenant could not provide sufficient reasons that the Landlord was acting in bad
faith by requiring the rental unit for personal use. However, the Tenant’s
Legal Representative asked that the Tenant have until June 2022 before moving out. The
Landlord’s Legal Representative was only willing to consider one or two months
as the original N12 was served back on July 7, 2021.
 
10.  Therefore,
I am satisfied, based on the Landlord’s evidence, that he genuinely intends
to live in the rental unit for at least one year. I find that the
Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I am
satisfied that this date is a fair compromise between what each party has
requested.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall give to the Tenant
a certified cheque of $2,040.00 on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of March
31, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.




 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
