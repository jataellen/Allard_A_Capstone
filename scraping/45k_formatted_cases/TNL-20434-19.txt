Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-20434-19
 











 
 
 

YMCA (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict NC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration charges.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has paid the rent
persistently late. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date as well as NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 13,
2019.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent, AI,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant did not attend the hearing.  I was
satisfied that the Tenant was served the Notice of Hearing, so I proceeded to
hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2019 to
December 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination.
 
3.     
The Landlord is entitled to
$25.00 to reimburse them for charges they incurred as a result of cheques
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant which were returned NSF and related
administration charges.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,234.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31,
2019.
 
6.     
The monthly rent increases
to $1,261.00 on January 1, 2020.
 
7.     
The Landlord’s agent, (AI),
said that the Tenant has been living in the rental unit since 2009.  She said
that the Tenant has not paid the full rent on time for many years.
 
8.     
The Landlord is seeking non
remedial termination of the tenancy because there has been only one payment
towards the rent since July, 2019.  AI said that the Tenant is not working and
avoids all communication from the Landlord.
 
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant has
made only one payment towards the rent in six months.  The Tenant owes a
substantial amount of arrears, and the arrears have been increasing every
month.  I find that it is prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to
continue.
It is ordered that:
L1 application:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January
26, 2020.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,535.67*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 15, 2020 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to
the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $41.46 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 16, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 26, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
January 27, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 26, 2020, then starting January 27, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 27, 2020.
 
8.     
If, on or before January 26,
2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,621.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 27, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2 application
10.  
Notwithstanding paragraphs 8
and 9 of this order, if the Tenant voids the order pursuant to paragraphs 8 or
9 of this order, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated,
as of February 29, 2020, pursuant to the L2 application. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 29, 2020.
11.   If the unit is not vacated on or before February
29, 2020, then starting March 1, 2020, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2020.
13.   The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $41.46 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit starting March 1, 2020, to the
date he moves out of the unit
