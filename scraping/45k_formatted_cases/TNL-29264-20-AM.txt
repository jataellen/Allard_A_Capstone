Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-29264-20-AM
 
 



In the matter
of:


2937 ISLINGTON AVENUE NORTH YORK ON M9L 2K3


 




Between:


Steve Sanguedolce


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle
Genova


Tenant



 
 
 
This order originally issued
earlier on January 12, 2022. It
subsequently came to this Member’s attention that the Landlord had already applied the last
month’s rent deposit to the arrears. The order is amended
to correct this clerical error. The amended
portions are bolded and
underlined for ease of reference.
 
Steve
Sanguedolce (the ‘Landlord’) applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Michelle Genova (the ‘Tenant’) because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the
‘L1 Application’).
 
This application
was heard via video conference on July 19, 2021 and reconvened on January 12,
2022. Only the Landlord attended the
hearing on either date. As of 9:31
a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the present
hearing although properly
served with notice
of this hearing by the
Landlord and Tenant Board (the ‘Board’). Tenant
Duty Counsel was available for consultation prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a
N4 Notice of termination effective November 16, 2020 (the ‘N4 Notice’).
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on September
6, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $2,850.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $22,879.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
As the Landlord
included unpaid utilities in the N4 Notice of termination, I find that the
notice is invalid as it does not accurately reflect
the rental arrears owing the Landlord as




File Number: TNL-29264-20-AM
 
of the date that
the notice was served. However, as
the issue of termination was rendered moot
when the Tenant vacated the rental unit on
September 6, 2021, the only part of the L1 Application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears. As a result,
the order in relation to that application will be limited to rent
arrears and costs only, not eviction.
 
6.    
This order contains all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will
issue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of September 6, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $4,265.19, which
represents the amount
of rent owing and
compensation up to September 6, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
January 23, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
