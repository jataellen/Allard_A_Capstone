Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-05033-19
 











 
 

M. M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict T. O'G. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Peterborough on October
24, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by G. G.. The Tenant spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel prior the hearing.

 
Determinations:
 
1.     
By way of background, this tenancy
began in January 2015; the monthly rent is $1,300.00 and is due on the first of
each month. 
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2015
to October 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 22, 2019.
3.     
Since the application was filed,
the Tenant made no payments towards the arrears. 
4.     
The arrears and costs owing to
October 31, 2019 total $14,735.00.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,300.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 30, 2014 to September 22,
2019.
7.     
Since the date of the hearing
the rent has come due for the months of November 2019 through to February 2020.
8.     
The Landlord seeks a standard,
voidable, eleven-day order. 
TENANT’S EVIDENCE
9.     
The Tenant does not dispute the
amount outstanding as claimed by the Landlord. 
10.  
The Tenant testified that the
reason he fell into arrears is because the second tenant left in 2017. He had been
using the money he inherited from his father’s estate to pay his rent until it was
depleted. He has attempted to rent out a room to help with the rent and other financial
expenses but has not been successful. 
11.  
The Tenant seeks a chance to
preserve his tenancy as he has invested a lot into this home and has lived in the
neighbourhood for forty-six years. He requests relief in the form of a repayment
plan; he proposes to pay an additional $500.00 on top of his monthly rent for the
next thirty months.
12.  
The Tenant testified that he
receives $1,000.00 from his casual part-time job and $330.00 on the 20th
of each month from a friend who he has loaned $15,000.00. His monthly income totals
$1,330.00. The Tenant testified that his monthly expenses are $1,300.00 which is
equal to the monthly rent. Upon cross-examination, the Tenant admitted that he is
in arrears of both the hydro and gas bills. 
13.  
The Tenant lives in the rental
unit on his own and has never been to the Board before. 
14.  
The Landlord opposes repayment
plan as its duration is too long for the Landlord and the arrears outstanding are
too high. The Tenant’s evidence appears
to indicate that the rental unit is not affordable for him.
ANALYSIS
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) of the Act.
16.  
The problem with the Tenant’s
proposed repayment plan is that after his expenses are subtracted from his income,
he is left with $30.00. Thus, it is unclear how the Tenant will be able to come
up with another $500.00 to pay towards the outstanding arrears. 
17.  
Repayment plans are granted
in order to allow a tenant to catch up on the arrears while continuing to pay
their monthly rent.  Here, based on the Tenant’s own statements, a repayment
plan would seem to be unrealistic and put the Tenants in further financial
distress. 
18.  
Therefore, I cannot grant
the Tenant’s request for a repayment plan. 
19.  
The Tenant stated he required
more time than the standard eleven days. However, he did not provide the Board with
any submissions on how much time he required, and no other circumstances were
disclosed with respect to why the Tenant required more than eleven days. Therefore,
I find that it would be unfair to postpone the eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act. 
20.  
An order shall issue accordingly.

21.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
21, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $17,519.74*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to February 10, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 11, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 21, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 22, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2020, then starting February 22, 2020, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 22, 2020.
8.     
If, on or before February
21, 2020, the Tenant pays the amount of $19,935.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 22, 2020 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
