Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21318-22
 
 
In the matter of:      804, 1651 VICTORIA
PARKE AVENUE EAST
SCARBOROUGH ON M1R1P9
 
Between:                  Danam Limited                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Bilal Akbar Rinku Uppal


Tenants




 
 
 
On January 5, 2022, Danam Limited (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Rinku Uppal and Bilal Akbar (the 'Tenants') and for an
order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by
the Board on December 15, 2021 with respect to L1 application TEL-19143-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided in paragraph 3 that the Landlord could apply to the Board under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants
if the Tenants did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay
$1500.00 arrears on or before December 31, 2021. The Tenant did not pay
$1,950.00 rent on or before January 1, 2022.
These were breaches of paragraph 2 of the consent
order. This L4 application as filed within 30 days of the breaches.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants agreed and were
ordered to pay $4,018.66 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee in the previous consent
order TEL-19143-21. At the
time this L4 application was filed the Tenants had failed to make any payment
towards the previous consent order, so there is still $4,018.66 owing from that
order,




 
which has been included in this order. As a result, the previous consent
order TEL- 19143-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On April 1, 2021,
the Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,950.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenants for the period from the date of collection, April 1, 2021
up to this order date, January 25, 2022 (note: there was no guideline rent increase allowed,
and consequently 0% deposit interest, for the year 2021
due to COVID19).
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
TEL-19143-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed on January 5, 2022, those amounts shall
be deducted from the calculations below.
 
Refer to the attached
Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$4,017.06*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.11 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting February
1, 2022 to the date the Tenants
move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.




 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.
