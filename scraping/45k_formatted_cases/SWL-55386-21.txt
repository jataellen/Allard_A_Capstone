AVENUE WINDSOR ON N9B2G6


 




Between:


Maggalene Ciccotelli


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bill (William) Zoldi


Tenant



 
 
 
Maggalene
Ciccotelli (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Bill (William) Zoldi (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord in a residential complex
that has three or fewer residential units.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal representative, M. Bradley, and witness, T. Cuglietta (TC),
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant
checked in with the Board Moderators at the beginning of the hearing block but
was not present at the time of the hearing. The Tenant was unresponsive to the
Moderators’ prompts as of 12:15 p.m. As of 1:43 p.m., the matter proceeded as
uncontested.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units. The Landlord served an N7 Notice of Termination on
the Tenant on September 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord resides on the upper floor and the Tenant
resides in basement of the residential complex. The Tenant is the Landlord’s brother.
There is a door that connects the basement unit to the upstairs unit. The
stairs connecting the units is a common area.
 
3.     The N7 Notice alleges that on July 20,
2021, the Tenant’s dog bit
the Landlord’s daughter in the
residential complex. The Notice further alleges that on August 19, 2021, a
guest of the Tenant knocked on the door of Landlord’s unit loudly at 2:00 a.m.




 
4.    
TC, the Landlord’s daughter,
testified that on July 20, 2021, she opened the connecting door and called down
to the Tenant. She informed the Tenant that her mother would like to speak with
him. The dog ran up the stairs and TC extended her hand to greet the dog. The
dog lunged at TC and clamped down on her forearm. The dog was not leashed or restrained.
 
5.     TC testified that on August 19, 2021, the Tenant’s
guests banged on the Landlord’s door at 2:00 a.m. When the Landlord informed
the guests that they are at the incorrect entrance, the guests said they know, but have
approached the Landlord’s unit because the Tenant was not responding.
 
6.     Section 65 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), the Landlord can serve a notice on the Tenant if the conduct of the
Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has
three or fewer residential units.
 
7.    
On a balance of probabilities, I find that by the Tenant’s dog biting the Landlord’s daughter, this substantially interfered
with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment. The Tenant not having care and
control of his pet resulted in injury to the Landlord’s guest in a common area
of the residential complex. I also find that the Tenant’s guest interfered with
the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment on August 19, 2021 based on TC’s uncontested evidence that the Tenant’s guest banged
on the Landlord’s door in the early hours of the morning.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. TC testified that she assists
the Landlord with various
tasks and is afraid to return to the basement
area due to the Tenant’s dog. The Landlord will be released
from the hospital
soon and is worried about
the ongoing risk of the
Tenant’s dog.
 
9.     In consideration of the foregoing, and the fact that
the Tenant was not present to disclose his circumstances for me to consider refusing
or delaying eviction, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 21, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February
21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
 
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 22, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite
the enforcement of this order.
