In the matter of:      30, 33 BERKLEY
DR
ST CATHARINES ON L2M6T8

and
 




Denis Clark Patricia Baker


Tenants




 
 
 
2748565 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Denis Clark and Patricia Baker (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
This
application was heard by video conference on June 22, 2021, beginning at 1:00
p.m.. The Landlord's Legal Representative Lauren
Brace attended the hearing. As of 1:40 p.m., the
Tenants were not present
or represented although
properly served with a notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2020 to June 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 21, 2020.
 
2.       
The Tenants paid for all arrears
for the period
ending June 30, 2021 after the application
was filed. The Tenants were in a credit balance as of the date of the hearing,
and the credit shall be applied to reduce the filing fee cost.
 
3.       
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord’s cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs only and not eviction. The parties may be able to reach an agreement that the Tenants will
make the payment on or by June 30, 2021, or in a timely manner. If not,
interest on the unpaid balance will accrue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $184.92
for the cost of filing
the application.




File Number: SOL-18789-20
 
2.       
If the Tenants have not paid the
Landlord the full amount owing by June 30, 2021, interest will accrue starting
from July 1, 2021. This will be
simple interest calculated from July 1, 2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
