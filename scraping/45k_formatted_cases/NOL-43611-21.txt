Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43611-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 17 MARTIN STREET NORTH BAY ON P1A1K8


 




Between:


Lyse Rocheleau


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anthony Fasano Michael Fasano


Tenant



 
 
 
Lyse Rocheleau (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Anthony Fasano Michael Fasano (the 'Tenant') because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 22, 2021.
 
At 11:24 am, the Landlord, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s Representative attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1350.00.
 
3.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one
month's rent on or around September 19, 2021. According to the Landlord
and as of the date of the hearing, the cheque has not been cashed by the
Tenant.
 
The Notice and Affidavit
 
4.     On July 23, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenants
with an N12 Notice to End Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family Member Requires
the Rental Unit (N12
notice). The N12 notices identified the Landlord’s child as the person who
intends to move into the rental unit and occupy if for at least one year.
 
5.     The date of termination on the N12 notice is September 30, 2021.




 
6.    
On the date of the hearing,
the Tenant’s Representative raised
the issue that the Tenants had not been provided with an
affidavit or declaration from the son as per section 72 (1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) which states:
 
The Board shall not make an order terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant in an
application under section 69 based on,
 
(a) a notice of termination given under
section 48 on or after the day section 13 of the Rental Fairness Act, 2017 comes into force, unless
the landlord has filed with the
Board an affidavit sworn by the
person who personally requires the rental unit certifying that the person in good faith
requires the rental
unit for his or her own
personal use for a period of at least one year;
 
7.    
There is no dispute
between the parties
that an affidavit from the son was not submitted
to the Tenants nor the Board.
 
8.    
It was the testimony
of the Landlord that her son had suffered medical
issues and was in
hospital. No reason was provided as
to why the son was not able to complete the
affidavit nor was any evidence
led on the situation of the Landlord’s son.
 
9.    
I find that the Landlord failed to
meet the requirements of the Act. Section
72(1) expressly prohibits the Board from evicting Tenants unless an affidavit
sworn by the person intended to occupy the premises is filed. No affidavit by the Landlord’s son was filed; nor
was an affidavit filed on his behalf specifying the affiant did not have the
capacity to complete the affidavit.
 
10.  Accordingly, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.     The Tenant shall return to the Landlord
the compensation cheque
in the amount of
$1350.00 upon receipt of this order.
