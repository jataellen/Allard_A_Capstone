Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02905-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER-P.O.BOX 694,
61 JOHN STREET BRADFORD ON L3Z2B1


 




Between:


Kevin Gudolin C/O Ryis Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bruce Graham


Tenant



 
 
Kevin Gudolin C/O Ryis Properties
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bruce
Graham (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Joey Kay, attended the hearing. As of 10:43 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
13, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,706.00 as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from August 1, 2020 to July
31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $7,000.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $496.16*,
which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $56.09
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 20,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,533.37** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and
on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
