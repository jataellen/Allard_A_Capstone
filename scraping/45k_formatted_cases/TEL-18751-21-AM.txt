Between:

Landlord




 


 
and

Tenant



 
 
 
The order has been amended to correct a calculation error in the total amount
owing.
 
Scott Therrien
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marcia Williams (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 24, 2021. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 10:00 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
13, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October
9, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,650.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
9, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $8,747.46*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 9, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 11, 2021,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from December 12,
2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
