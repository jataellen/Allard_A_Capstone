Chinese Community Building Corporation c/o. The Regional
Group (the 'Landlord') applied in this L1 application for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica Chikwanha (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
telephone/video-conference on November 30, 2021. The Landlord’s legal
representative David Lyman and the Landlord’s witness Christina Doraty
(property administrator for The Regional
Group) attended the hearing. As of 11:16am
(the hearing block started at
9am) the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with
notice of the hearing by the Board. As per section 7 of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act the hearing continued in the Tenant’s absence.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenant failed to pay the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination with
effective termination date November 5, 2020.
 
2.       
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit at the time the application
was filed. The tenant vacated the rental unit on November 10, 2021. The
application was amended to an L9 application.
 
3.       
The monthly
rent was $1,014.00 for the duration
of arrears claimed.
Rent was due on the first (1st) day of each month.
 
4.       
The Tenant paid $8,800.00 after
the application was filed but before the hearing ($8,600.00 was noted on the L1 L9 Information Update Sheet, but the Landlord’s legal representative confirmed a recent payment of $200.00 had
been received a few days before the hearing).




File Number: EAL-93024-20
 
5.       
There was no last month’s rent deposit collected.
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy is terminated as of November
10, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after the hearing,
those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations
below.

The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $20.00 for administrative costs relating to a bounced cheque
for $1,000.00 that was dated September 15, 2021 but was returned
for insufficient funds on September 17, 2021.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
