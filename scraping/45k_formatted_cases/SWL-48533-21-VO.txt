Tenants



 
 
 
 
Nicholas Egedy and Taylor Fletcher (the 'Tenants') filed a
motion to set aside order SWL-48533-
21 because, before the eviction
order was enforced, the Tenants paid the amount
required under subsection
74(11) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') to void the
order.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, P. Duwyn, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
did not attend
the hearing. I waited 15 minutes, and then
I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
The Tenants have not
previously made a motion under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside
an eviction order
during the period
of the Tenants' tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
3.     The Landlord’s legal representative said that the Tenants have paid the amount required under subsection 74(11) of the
Act to void the eviction order to October 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    Order SWL-48533-21 is void and cannot be enforced by the Landlord
