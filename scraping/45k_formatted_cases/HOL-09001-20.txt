Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-09001-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


910, 2 VENA
  WAY
NORTH YORK ON
  M9M0G5


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mitzy Ann Kareen
Blair


Tenant



 
 
 
Medallion Corporation (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mitzy Ann Kareen Blair (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on January 17, 2022. The Landlord’s
legal representative Marija Pavic and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from June 1,
2020 to August 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 25,
2020.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,120.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2019
to November 25, 2020.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $283.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on August
10, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant testified
that she is currently not employed and would require
approximately 2-3 years to repay the balance owing.
 
7.     The Landlord’s legal representative opposed
the Tenant’s request
stating that the Tenant
has been in arrears of rent since June 2020 and has made little to no effort to
repay the outstanding arrears.

8.    
Based on the evidence before the
Board I find it would be unfair to grant the Tenant’s request. Since filing the L1 application over 1 year ago, the Tenant has made a minimal
impact on reducing the debt owing and provided no evidence to indicate that
this approach would change if additional time was granted.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated on August
10, 2021, the day possession was returned to the
Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$27,890.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 10, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 2, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
