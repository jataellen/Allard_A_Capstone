Karissa Proulx Tonya Julien


Tenants




 
 
 
London & Middlesex Community
Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Karissa
Proulx and Tonya
Julien (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November
22, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tanya Murray, attended the hearing. As of
10:04 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenants 2 N5 notices of
termination alleging that, on several occasions between July 7, 2020 to September 1, 2020, the Tenants’, an occupant of the
rental unit, or the Tenants guest’s behaviour has substantially interfered with
others.
 
2.    
On any application before the
Board, the person who alleges any particular incident or event occurred
has the burden
of leading sufficient evidence to establish
that it is more likely than
not that their version of events is true. In this case that burden falls on the
Landlord.
 
3.     The Board finds that the Landlord has led insufficient
evidence to establish the allegations in the N5 notices of termination. I say
this because the Landlord’s evidence was entirely hearsay.
The Landlord submitted
several emails of complaint’s they received
from other tenants. These emails are
hearsay - they are out of court statements adduced for the truth of their contents
without the ability to cross-examine the author. The complaining tenants were
not present at the hearing to testify and the Landlord did not




File Number: SWL-46037-20
 
provide a satisfactory explanation for not calling
the witnesses. Therefore, I give the emails no weight.
 
4.     As the Landlord
led insufficient evidence to prove the allegations in the N5 notices of termination, the application must be
dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
