Order under Section

Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TET-12136-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 105 MILFORD
HAVEN DRIVE SE SCARBOROUGH ON M1G3C9


 




Between:


Rosemarie Heastings


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Ben Sega


Landlord



 
 
 
Rosemarie
Heastings (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Ben Sega (the
'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the
Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 12, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant filed an application about Tenant Rights on August 25, 2020 alleging:
 
a.   
The Landlord
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the Tenant,
and
 
b.   
The Landlord
harassed, coerced, obstructed or interfered with the Tenant.
 
2.    
Allegations specifically allege
 
a.   
The Landlord
has failed to provide coins for the laundry as has been the agreement between the parties, and
 
b.   
The Landlord
has been harassing the Tenant over late rent payments, placement of garbage bins, and insulting language.
 
3.    
It was uncontested that by a previous consent
agreement the Landlord
was providing coins for
laundry and that this had stopped in May 2020.




 
4.    
The Landlord testified
that the Tenant had been causing damages to the Laundry machines, as evidenced on the security
footage, and as a result the Landlord
stopped providing these coins. In
the text messages provided to the Board, the Landlord also makes reference to a
service charge of $150.00 as reason to stop providing coins.
 
5.    
There was no dispute
that the Tenant
had access to the laundry
room, and was not being prevented from using the coin
operated laundry machines, only that the Tenant was not being provided marked
coins for that purpose.
 
6.    
I am satisfied that the
Landlord has substantially interfered with the Tenants reasonable enjoyment by refusing to provide the marked laundry
coins to the Tenant. This has been an ongoing practice the parties had
consented to when the Landlord installed coin operated laundry machines in the
residential complex. The unilateral
action of the Landlord to withhold the marked coins is unreasonable.
 
7.    
The Tenant
was seeking reimbursement for reasonable laundry
expenses incurred from May 2020. This amounts to $20.00 per month until December 2021, $380.00
 
8.    
The Tenant testified that she had been served with N5 notices of termination and that
the allegations amount to harassment. The
Landlord is entitled to enforce landlord rights. Should those notices result in
a hearing at the Board, the Tenant will be afforded the opportunity to defend
against them, and to raise any issue under s.82 of the Act, at that hearing,
and to raise any issue relative to relief from eviction under s.83 of the Act. The allegation of harassment appeared to
be more of a pre-emptive effort by the Tenant to defend against the notices
and as such I am not satisfied that they amount to harassment under s.29(4) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
must refrain from interfering with the Tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment and shall maintain the terms of the prior
consent agreement to provide marked
coins to the Tenant for the purpose of doing laundry.
 
2.    
The Landlord shall pay
to the Tenant $380.00 which is the reasonable out of pocket expenses the Tenant has incurred for having to go off-site
to do laundry and pay for it.
 
3.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $48.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
The total amount the Landlord owes is $428.00
 
5.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 16, 2022.
 
6.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 16, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant
the full amount owing by January 31, 2022, the Tenant may recover this amount by
deducting the amount owed from the rent.




 
8.    
If the Landlord fails
to provide the marked coins for laundry, the Tenant may deduct an amount not to exceed
$20.00 per month
from the monthly
rent, for each month in which
the Landlord fails to provide the coins.
