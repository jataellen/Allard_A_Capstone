Christine Comand (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Katherine (Kay)
Robinson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 25, 2020 and heard to conclusion on February
8, 2022. The Landlord attended
both hearings. The Tenant and the Tenant’s
Legal Representative, Walter Kravchuk attended the hearing on November
25, 2020 and only the Tenant’s Legal Representative, Chris Cieslik attended the
hearing on February 08, 2022.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.

the rental unit on November
30, 2020. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
As of June 1, 2020, the lawful monthly
rent for the unit is $3,839.32.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $3,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $11,435.31 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November 30, 2020, the date the Tenant
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.

the full amount
owing* on or before
