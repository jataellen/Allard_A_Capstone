Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12144-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN& 2ND FLOOR, 8 BOWKETT DRIVE RICHMOND HILL ON L4E0J8


 




Between:


Ling Wang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Haijing Li Kun Tang


Tenants



 
 
 
Ling Wang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kun Tang and Haijing Li (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Jinhua Shao, and the Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s representative requested
that the L1 application they have filed be heard with this application. The L1 was not scheduled to be heard with this application so
the request was denied. The Board
offered to adjourn this application so both matters could be heard together.
The Landlord’s representative did not want to adjourn.
 
The Landlord’s representative
also wanted to proceed with a matter related
to N5 notices that were not a part of this application. The application has not been amended and filed with the Board to include the N5 notice
and an amended application was not served
on the Tenants so they would
know that these issues would be addressed during this hearing. Therefore, any issues related to N5
notices were not heard.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have been persistently late paying rent.
 
2.     After the N8 notice was served on the Tenants
they paid October
and November rent on
time. They have not paid December nor
January rent claiming there are maintenance issues the Landlord has not
addressed.




 
3.    
The Tenant agreed that they would pay this rent as set out below as a condition of relief from
eviction. They also agreed they could
pay their rent in full and on time going forward.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord the outstanding rent in the amount of $4,192.00 as follows:
 
•        
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,000.00 on or before
January 21, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,000.00 on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $192.00
on or before January 23, 2022.
 
2.     Should the Tenants
fail to make the above
said payments in full and on time, the tenancy between the Landlord and the
Tenants is terminated, as of January 31, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
5.     Should the Tenants
make the above said payments
in full and on time, the Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent in full and on time for each
consecutive month commencing February 2022 and continuing through January 2023.
 
6.     In the event the Tenant fails to make the above said
payment in full and on time, the entire balance of the amount set out in this
Order will become due and payable forthwith under this Order. The Landlord shall be entitled to apply to
the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order, without notice
to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, pursuant
to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
