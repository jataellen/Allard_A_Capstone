LAKE ROAD MARKHAM ON L6B0X4


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and

  Suvarna Sathees


Tenants



 
 
 
Kamalenthiran Subramaniyam (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Suvarna Sathees and Sathees Pathmanathan (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Thirusenthuran Sivapatham, attended the hearing.
As of 2:47 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from August 5, 2021
to February 4, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,250.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,250.00 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid all arrears for the period
ending February 4, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
6.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
