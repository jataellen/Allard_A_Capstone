Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21473-19










 
 

GHL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DT
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 21, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, KA, the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, RC, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 18, 2019.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s
rent arrears for the period ending January 31, 2020.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,315.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 15, 2019
to October 18, 2019.
 
5.      At
the hearing, the Tenant requested relief from eviction.  The Tenant testified
that a recent change in her financial circumstances will allow her to pay the
rent on time, and the full arrears within approximately six months.  The Tenant
gave evidence of her belief that she can pay $1,000.00 a month toward her
arrears.
 
6.       I
find, however, that the Tenant’s evidence is not credible.
 
7.      The
Tenant explained that she was not able to pay the rent, because she lost her
employment on December 4, 2019.  I note, however, that the Tenant’s arrears
began in October 2019, while the Tenant was still employed at her former
full-time job as an office administrator.
 
8.      Although
the Tenant gave evidence of her belief that her income will be approximately
$3,500.00 from a full-time and part-time jobs, the Tenant conceded that the
full-time position only began on January 20, 2020 and the part-time position
sometime in the week of January 13, 2020.  The Tenant did not submit an
employment contract detailing her hourly wage or other income.  I therefore
find the Tenant’s estimate of her monthly income is not reliable.
 
9.      I
also find that, since the Tenant has only begun to earn employment income, her
evidence that she can pay the full rent to the Landlord on February 1, 2020 and
$1,000.00 toward her arrears on February 15, 2020 is not credible.  
 
10.   The
Tenant has not made any payment to the Landlord since October 2019.  Although I
accept that the Tenant sincerely wishes to pay the amount of arrears she owes
to the Landlord, her assertion that she can now pay the full rent and $1,000.00
each month toward her arrears is not credible.  
 
11.   I
therefore find that it is appropriate to terminate the tenancy.
 
12.   However,
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
February 29, 2020, pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act, because the Landlord is holding a rent deposit from the
Tenant.   
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 29, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,868.44*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 28, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $43.23 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 29, 2020 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 29, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 29, 2020, then starting March 1,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2020.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,450.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $6,765.00 if the payment is made on or before February 29, 2020**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 29, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
