Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19890-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 7 NASSAU STREET OSHAWA ON L1J4A3


 




Between:


Ming Zhong


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Ruch Julia St Martin


Tenants



 
 
 
Ming Zhong (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Julia St Martin and John Ruch (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did
not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 4:08pm the Tenants were not present
despite being served with notice of hearing from the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 23, 2019 to September 28, 2021.
 
4.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,

is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$10,401.79*, which represents the amount of rent

interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.

February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$13,983.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 7, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
