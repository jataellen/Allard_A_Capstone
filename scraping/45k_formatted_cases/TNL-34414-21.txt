Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34414-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


ROOM #3, 16 JONES
COURT AURORA ON L4G2B8


 




Between:


Tatiana Brudny


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Steve Joncas


Tenant



 
 
 
Tatiana Brudny (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steve Joncas (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1);
and because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant (L2).
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February
3, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 24,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant paid $4,474.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.     The Tenant yells,
screams and wants to fight with other
tenants. Because of the Tenant’s behaviour, the neighbours are
afraid of the Tenant. The police are
regularly called and have been at the
residential complex due the Tenant’s
behaviour many times.
The police informed the
Landlord that they should seek an order from the Board to deal with the
Tenant’s conduct.
 
4.     I find the Tenant has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
Because of this finding this order cannot be voided by the
Tenant.
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.

1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant

the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the

does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
