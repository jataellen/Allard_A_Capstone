Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43794-21
 



In the matter
of:


2-BASEMENT, 305 BROCK
STREET EAST THUNDER BAY ON
  P7E4H6


 




Between:


Mark Berwosky


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christine Gravel James Phair
Phair


Tenants



 
 
 
Mark Berwosky (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Christine Gravel and James Phair Phair (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Walter Marchese, attended the hearing. As
of 10:21 a.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April
1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 30,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $800.00.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The amount outstanding is substantial, and
the Tenants have not paid any rent since the application was filed.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $9,597.04*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $26.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,401.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 18, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
