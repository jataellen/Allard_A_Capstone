Calijah
Stubbington Morgan Gerner


Tenants



 
 
Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Calijah Stubbington and Morgan
Gerner (the 'Tenants') to pay compensation for the damages
caused by them or
a person they permitted in the residential complex
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Stephanie Laurensen, and witness Hannah McLurg, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The witness, as well as
two other employees, witnessed the Tenant’s vehicle on the grass and confirmed the Tenant’s vehicle
was driven by video surveillance. The Tenant’s vehicle
caused the damage shown in the photographs which were entered as evidence.
 
3.    
The Landlord
has received an estimate of $1,415.63 to repair the damage. I find, based on the evidence, that this is a
reasonable amount to repair the damage.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not seeking termination of the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,415.63, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.




File Number: NOL-44006-21
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 24, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
