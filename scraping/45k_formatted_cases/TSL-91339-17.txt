Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-91339-17










 

P.R.E.S.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.O (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF
cheque charges and related administration charges (the “L1 application”).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent (the “L2 application”). 
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on March 2, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by K.L, licensed paralegal. 
 
J.C
(“JC”), an employee of the Landlord, appeared as a witness for the Landlord.
 
The
Tenant did not attend. I had no record before me of a request to adjourn and I
was satisfied that the Tenant received proper notice of the time, place and
location of the hearing. Nonetheless, I waited until after 10:30 a.m. When the
Tenant still did not arrive, I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s applications.
            
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Matter
 
1.      The
Landlord’s legal representative requested the Landlord’s application be amended
to include a claim for damages to the residential by the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex. Said damages amount to $600.00 charged by the condominium corporation
to clean dog urine, caused on several occasions by the Tenant’s dog, in a
common area of the residential. The Landlord provided the invoices issued by
the condominium corporation in this regard.
2.      As the
Landlord’s request to amend the application was unopposed, I granted the
Landlord’s request. The Landlord’s application is amended to include a claim
for damages, pursuant to subsection 89(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act').
3.      The Landlord’s
application was further amended to reflect NSF charges in the sum of $7.00 for
each of the three cheques issued by the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
The
L1 Application
4.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from November 15, 2017 to March 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 7, 2017.
5.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $21.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
6.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the Tenant and the Landlord
is still holding this deposit.
7.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 16, 2017
to December 7, 2017.
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The
L2 Application
Persistent
Late Payment of Rent
9.      The
Landlords’ uncontradicted evidence is the Tenant has persistently failed to pay
the rent on the date it was due. In particular, the Tenant has failed to pay
the monthly rent on time each and every month from August, 2017 to February,
2018. 
10.   Based
on the evidence presented I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant has
been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
Substantial
Interference
11.   The
Landlord’s application was preceded by a first N5 notice of termination (the
“N5 notice”) deemed served on October 31, 2017. The first N5 notice was
void because the Tenant corrected the problem within the time period set out in
the notice and as permitted by subsection 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Landlord served a second N5 notice pursuant to
Section 67 of the Act on December 8, 2016 bearing a termination date of
December 31, 2017.
12.   The
Landlord’s allegations are that, on four occasions from September 13, 2017 to
September 20, 2017, the Tenant allowed her dog to urinate and deposit feces on
the balcony of the unit, which is a common element of the residential complex,
and then proceeded to wash the debris off the balcony causing same to fall on
the balconies below. 
13.   As
stated, the Tenant voided the first N5 notice by ceasing the impugned conduct.
The Landlord served the Tenant with a second N5 notice based on complaints
received from another tenant of the complex alleging similar conduct. In
particular on or about December 3, 2017 the Landlord received an incident
report where the tenant below the Tenant’s unit noticed urine on her balcony,
which emanated from the Tenant’s unit.
14.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontradicted evidence, I find, on a balance of
probabilities, that the conduct of the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex, in allowing
the Tenant’s dog to urinate and deposit feces in the balcony of the unit, which
debris then fell on the balconies of other tenants of the complex, as described
in the N5 notices and corroborated by the Landlord’s documentary evidence, has
substantially interfered with other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex and, further, that this conduct substantially interferes
with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord and other tenants. 
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
The
Damages Claim
16.   The
Landlord provided four invoices, in the sum of $400.00, issued by the complex’s
management office for the cost of cleaning dog urine in the complex. The
Landlord further provided a letter from the complex’s management company
requesting an additional payment of $200.00 for the same service on other
occasions and stating the Tenant’s cheque for payment in this regard was
returned NSF. As the said charges were charged to the unit, an order will
issue requiring the Tenant to pay the Landlord $600.00.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 17, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,488.75*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 6, 2018 and the total charges related
to 3 NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less
the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 7, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
17, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 17, 2018, then starting March 18,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 18, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the arrears portion of this order and continue the
tenancy to March 17, 2018, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust:
i)        $6,871.00 if the payment is made on or before March 14, 2018, or
ii)       $8,521.00 if the payment is made on or before March 17, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      If
the Tenant complies with paragraph 8 above, then:
a)    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before March 17, 2018.
b)     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 17, 2018, then starting March 18, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
c)     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 18, 2018.
10.   The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after March 18, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
11.   The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $600.00 for the cost of cleaning the urine and/or
feces deposited by the Tenant’s dog in the residential complex.
12.   If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 17, 2018,
the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from March 18, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
