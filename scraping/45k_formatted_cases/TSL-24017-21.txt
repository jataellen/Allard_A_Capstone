Tenant



 
 
 
Hazelview Property Services
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Sang (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Vinuri Sivalingam attended the hearing. As of 10:06 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from October
1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent was
$1,519.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord’s NSF
cheque charge was not substantiated. Therefore, the claim was denied.
 
6.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,519.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TSL-24017-21
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021
to September 1, 2021.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The Tenancy is
terminated as of October 31, 2021, the date
the Tenants gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $13,132.72*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 11, 2021, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2021 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
