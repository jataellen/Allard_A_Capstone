Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25405-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


11, 2301
SHERIDAN GARDEN DRIVE OAKVILLE ON L6J7R9


 




Between:


Halton Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Andrew Mountain
  Latoya Berry


Tenants



 
Halton Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andrew Mountain and Latoya Berry (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Michelle Hepp, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,856.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $201.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25405-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,145.98*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$61.02 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 8, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 28,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,725.22** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
