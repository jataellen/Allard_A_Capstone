Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24004-21
 



In the matter
of:


A, 5166 DUNDAS
STREET W ETOBICOKE ON
  M9A1C4


 




Between:


Cimitan Enterprises Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


May McLean


 



 
 
 
Cimitan Enterprises Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict May McLean (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord’s Agents,
P. Cimitan and A. Cimitan, the Landlord's Legal Representative, J.
Solomon, the Tenant's Legal Representative, M. Daily and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
The Tenant asserted that the Notice to End your Tenancy Early for
Non-payment of Rent (N4) served by the Landlord is invalid because
it showed that the Tenant owed the rent for the month of
August 2021.
 
There was no dispute that on August 5, 2021, while the rent for the
month of July 2021 was still outstanding, the Tenant paid one month’s rent to
the Landlord. This payment was applied by the Landlord to the month of July 2021. As the Tenant
did not specifically request that the payment be applied to August 2021, I find the
Landlord rightly applied it to the last period rent was owed. Consequently, I
find the N4 notice of termination valid.
 
The Tenant’s request
for an adjournment to prepare
for the hearing
was denied in accordance with section 183 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 which provides that the Board shall adopt the most
expeditious method of determining the questions arising in a proceeding that
affords to all persons directly affected by the proceeding an adequate opportunity
to know the issues and be heard on the matter. The Tenant was served with the
N4 notice as well as the Notice of Hearing and had adequate time to prepare for
the hearing. Nevertheless, the application was stood down for over an hour to
enable the Tenant to confer further with her representative.




 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 25,
2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,990.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant
paid $3,980.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Tenant, who is a
senior, testified that having previously retired, she had to start working
again to keep up with her household expenses as well as care for her sister who
has health issues and is in receipt of income from the Ontario Disability
Support Program. The Tenant earns approximately $4,100.00 ($3200.00 income +
$900.00 pension) monthly while her sister receives $1,400.00 each month. The
Tenant’s proposed plan to pay the outstanding amount was granted and is
outlined below.
 
6.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,990.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 26, 2020 to August 25, 2021.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction
subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$6,156.00,
which represents the arrears of rent
$5,970.00 and costs $ 186.00 outstanding for the period
ending December 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant
shall make the following payments
to the Landlord in respect
of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)   The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the
rent for the months of January 2022 up to and
including July 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each
corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlords may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for
the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges
not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order.
The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a
condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
