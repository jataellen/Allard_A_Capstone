Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24332-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


SECOND FLOOR 1542A,
1542 BAYVIEW AVENUE TORONTO ON M4G3B6


 




Between:


Roshan Tejani 1240556 Ontario Inc


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Erin O’Brien
Paul Versteeg-Lytwyn


Tenants



 
 
 
Roshan Tejani
and 1240556 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Paul Versteeg-Lytwyn and Erin O’Brien (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlords for the damage; and because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 18, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Roshan Tejani, the Landlords’ Agent, Faheem Tejani, and the Tenant, Paul
Versteeg- Lytwyn attended the hearing.
 
At the
hearing, I raised two preliminary issues with respect to pages missing from the
N5 Notice of Termination (‘the
Notice’) and handwritten changes made by the Landlord to the Notice. The
specific pages noted on the Notice were “4 & 5”. The Landlord was not able to provide those additional pages at
the hearing. The handwritten changes
inferred that the Tenants were interfering with the reasonable enjoyment of the
“main floor retail tenant”.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    According to the Ontario Divisional Court’s decisions
in both Kuzyk v. S.K. Properties[1] and Ball v. Metro Capital
Property and Lockhurst,[2] if a Notice of termination issued by a
Landlord is confusing to the degree that a reasonable person could not
understand the precise actions or omissions that caused the Landlord to pursue
eviction, a Member would find it defective.
Specifically, the Court in Ball stated that “particulars should include
dates




File Number: TSL-24332-21
 
and times of the alleged offensive
conduct, together with a detailed
description of the alleged conduct engaged in by the
tenant.”
 
2.    I find that the Notice is lacking the particulars to
which a reasonable person would understand the allegations against them. The Landlord also changed the Notice to
fit their specific situation. The lack of
particulars and altering
the Notice have caused the Notice to be
defective.
 
3.    The Landlord requested consent to withdraw their
application. In accordance with
subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords' application is dismissed without prejudice.
