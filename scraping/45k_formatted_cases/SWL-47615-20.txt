Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SWL-47615-20
 



In the matter
of:


1, 8 DEVERON CRESCENT LONDON ON N5Z4A9


 




Between:


Laskey Properties


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dale Seeley


Tenant



 
Laskey Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dale Seeley (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 695 7516 4596# on June 24, 2021 and January 21, 2022.The Landlord’s Representative Chris Surowich
and the Tenant’s
Representative attended the
hearing.
The Tenant’s request for an adjournment was denied because
he had an authorized
Representative to act on his behalf.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The N4 Notice
of Termination contained information that was confusing. The rent charge was a discounted rent charge that
factored in a tax rebate discount; it was different from the NORI issued to the
Tenant; and different from the
amount the Tenant believes is the
lawful rent. It also identified October 2021 as partially paid and November
2021 rent charges as not paid which conflicted with the information on the
Landlord’s ledger. The Landlord failed to provide proof that the payments made
by the Tenant for that period were payments intended to be applied to back
rent.
 
2.     The content of N4 is not accurate
due to the ambiguity created
from the Landlord’s accounting practises. The
Landlord’s request for an eviction order under the L1 application is denied.
The Landlord did not want to amend the application to an L9
application for arrears only.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The application is
dismissed.
