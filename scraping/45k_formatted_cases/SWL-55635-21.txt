Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55635-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
205B, 3275
COLLEGE AVENUE WINDSOR ON
  N9C2V2


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charles Copeland


Tenant



 
 
 
Amiraco Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Charles Copeland
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jessica Lapkowski attended the hearing. As of 2:32 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $661.83.
 
4.     The NSF cheque charges were not substantiated; therefore, the claim
was denied.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $659.13 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 1, 2015 to September 25, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $1,326.00 after the application was filed.

8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,281.73*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
31, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.76
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,169.15 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,830.98 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
