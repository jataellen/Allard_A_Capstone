In the
  matter of:


APT. 1, 77 MAIN STREET ERIN ON N0B1T0


 




Between:


2083166 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Alex Kearsey
  Katie Cook


Tenants



 
 
2083166 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Alex Kearsey and Katie Cook (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 13, 2021.
 
The Landlord, 2083166 Ontario
Inc, represented by Mike Magill,
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N12 Notice of Termination for purchaser’s own use on July 21, 2021 in accordance with section 49 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Termination date in
the notice is September 30, 2021.
 
2.     Hoang Nguyen has an agreement
with the Landlord
to purchase the residential complex and they in good faith require
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
3.     The Landlord filed a copy of the Agreement of Purchase and sale dated June 18, 2021
that has a completion date of August 31, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord confirmed at the hearing that the
property has changed hands with the purchasers
as of August 31, 2021 and Hoang Nguyen is now the successor Landlord.
 
5.     The Landlord testified
that the purchaser
runs a restaurant in the same property
and purchased the property in order to live at the same location.




 
6.    
The Landlord filed the signed
declaration of Hoang Nguyen dated October 5,
2021 which indicates that the purchaser will be moving into the rental unit with his wife and daughters
for at least a year.
 
7.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent by e-transfer on September 29, 2021.
 
8.     The Tenants did not challenge
the evidence of the Landlord
at the hearing. The Tenants were more concerned that they may
not have a place to go if they have to move.
 
9.    
Based on the
uncontradicted evidence before me, I find that the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation by the purchaser and the purchaser’s family.
 
10.  The Tenants testified that they have been living in
the unit for just over 2 years. They
operate a small engine business and their main clientele is in the area. They also have daycare available in town. If they have to move, then they would have
to get new clientele and find a new daycare. They indicated that their credit
is poor and that rent for
a new unit is almost triple to what they currently pay.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
15, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 16, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
