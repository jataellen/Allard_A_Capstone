Review Order
 
BN (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that WPM (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's
maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance
standards; that the Landlord, or the Landlord's superintendent or the
Landlord's agent, harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with
the Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant or
by a member of the Tenant's household; and has collected or retained money
illegally.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNT-17219-19 and TNT-14258-19 issued on November 29, 2021.
 
On December 23, 2021,
the Tenant requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
In the request to review, the
Tenant alleges they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing. The
Tenant checked this box on the request to review but did not provide any written
explanation as to why they were not reasonably able to participate. As such, I am not able to determine or make a
preliminary decision that the Tenant may or may not have been able to reasonably participate in the hearing.
As such, the Tenant’s request
to review the order on this ground is denied.
 
2.       
The Tenant also alleges that the
order contains a serious error. The
Tenant states that the dismissal was a violation of the Rules of Natural
Justice. However, again,
the Tenant provides no written
explanation or description of the alleged serious error or what they

believe to be a violation of the
Rules of Natural Justice. In the absence of submissions from the Tenant
on this issue, the
Tenant’s request to review the order on this ground
is denied.
 
3.       
On the basis of the
submissions made in the request,
I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in
the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    The
request to review order TNT-17219-19 and TNT-14258-19 issued
on November 29, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed
and remains unchanged.
