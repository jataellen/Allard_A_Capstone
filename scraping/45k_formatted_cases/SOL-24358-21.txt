Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24358-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


304, 216 COLLEGE AVENUE W GUELPH ON
  N1G1S7


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jessica Sacrey


Tenant



 
 
 
Matrix
Non-profit Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Jessica Sacrey (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 23, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s representative, M. Sawicki, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant paid $280.00
after the application was filed.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $339.94*,
which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 11, 2022.




 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $3.78
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $596.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
