Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44267-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


111, 120 CUMBERLAND STREET S THUNDER
  BAY ON P7B5R7


 




Between:


Tbdssab


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cloud Chisel


Tenant



 
 
 
Tbdssab (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Cloud Chisel (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on February
7, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Betty McConkey-Kennelly attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant moved into the rental unit in March 2021. The Landlord served an N5 notice
to terminate the tenancy due the damage the Tenant caused to the unit as well
as substantially interfering with the reasonable enjoyment of other tenants.
 
2.     Photographs show that the Tenant have taken out
kitchen drawers, torn the countertop off of the bathroom vanity,
ripped of light fixtures, torn up flooring,
and cause holes in the walls and the refrigerator door.
 
3.     There have also been ongoing domestic disputes. The Tenant’s guests bang on the Tenant’s window
and hollering for the Tenant.
This behaviour has been complained about by other tenants in the residential complex.
 
4.     I find the Tenant or an occupant
of the rental unit has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit.




 
5.    
The Landlord will incur costs of $7,931.77 to repair the damage and replace property
that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
6.     I find the Tenant has substantially interfered with t tenants'
reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$7,931.77, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$409.94, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 4, 2021
to February 14, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$3.98 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
