Review Order
 
Yigal Rifkind (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nyaomi Dennis and Malaika Dennis
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order TNL-30962-21 issued on October
25, 2021. On November 3,
2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard by videoconference on January 21, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based on the ground of serious error.
 
2.     In the order under review, the Member made a finding
that the Tenant had vacated the rental unit on July 31, 2021 after hearing the Tenant’s testimony that she moved out on
May 23, 2021 and that the Tenant
had not, as of the date of hearing, given
the Landlord the keys to the
unit.
 
3.     The finding that the Tenant vacated on July 31, 2021
is not based on any evidence given by either party and is therefore
unreasonable. There is no section of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 that provides for deeming a date that a tenant
has vacated when the
parties disagree as to the date the tenant left. The only reasonable finding in
these




 
circumstances would be that the
Tenant had not vacated as of the hearing date, which was October 18, 2021. The Member
heard no evidence
that the Tenant
had given notice at any time prior
to the hearing and it was uncontested that the Tenant
had not given the
keys to the Landlord.
 
4.     Based on the above, at the review
hearing I found
that there was a serious
error in the order and I granted the Landlord’s
request for a review.
 
5.     The most appropriate way to remedy
the order under
review is to cancel and replace it with an order finding that the Tenant
vacated the unit on October 18, 2021.
 
L1 application determinations
 
6.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to October
18, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 23, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
18, 2021.
 
8.     The Tenants were in possession of the unit when the application was filed.
 
9.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,500.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
10.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
11, 2020 to February 23, 2021.
 
11.  The Tenants paid $1,250.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-30962-21 issued
on October 20, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
18, 2021 when the Tenants
gave vacant possession of the
unit to the Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$18,250.88*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February 11, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
