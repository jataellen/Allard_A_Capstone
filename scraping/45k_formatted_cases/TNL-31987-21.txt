Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-31987-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


277 GEER TERRACE NEWMARKET ON L3Y8K5


 




Between:


Inter Faith
  Homes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chantel
Ramnarin


Tenant



 
 
 
Inter Faith
Homes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Chantel Ramnarin (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on July 5, 2021. The Landlord was represented by
Matt Anderson. As of 11:28 a.m. the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice
of this hearing
as it appears from the Certificate of Service.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice
of Termination effective March 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
167.00.
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing
for the period
ending July 31, as of the date of hearing
were
$663.00.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $168.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
Representative consented to an extended eviction date of August 31, 2021.     The Tenant has benefited from the delay to issue this order and the eviction shall not be extended beyond January 16,
2022.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a repayment plan with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,535.41 (less any payments
made to the Landlord
after July 5, 2021)*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$5.49 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,851.01(less any payments
made to the Landlord after July 5, 2021)** to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.

The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
