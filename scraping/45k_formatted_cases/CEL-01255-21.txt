Sunita Chopra, Reena
Sharma-Joshi, Kavita Toor and Randeep Cheema (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Chris Vanderlinde and Lori Young (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlords also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 24,
2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Christine Hugel, and the Tenant, Lori Young representing both Tenants, attended the
hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid $2,400.00
of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from May 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,400.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord incurred costs of $186.00
for filing the application and NSF costs of $40.00 and is entitled to reimbursement
of those costs.
 
5.     The Landlord
is holding a rent deposit of $2,400.00.

6.     The amount outstanding to February 28, 2022,
inclusive of rent arrears, and costs, is
$5,026.00.
 
7.    
At the hearing, the Tenant, Lori Young, proposed
a reasonable repayment plan which I accepted as the basis for this order.
 
8.     This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay the Landlord
$5,026.00, which represents the arrears of rent and costs outstanding for the period
ending February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)  
The Tenants shall pay installments of $600.00 on or before
the 1st of the month for
the eight (8) month period commencing April 1, 2022 to November 1, 2022.
 
(b)  
The remaining balance of $226.00 shall be paid on or before
December 1, 2022.
 
(c)  
The Tenants shall pay the Landlord
the monthly rent for the months of March
2022 and December 2022 in full and by the first day of each
corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants
and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already
ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application
within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall
become payable on the day following the date of default. The
monies owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined
under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
