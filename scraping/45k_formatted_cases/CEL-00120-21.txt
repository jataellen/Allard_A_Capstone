In the matter
of:


LOWER UNIT, 49 MAPLEGROVE AVENUE BRADFORD ON L3Z1R9


 




Between:


Perdi Living
  Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Magdlenar Gasser
  Randy Butson


Tenants



 
 
Perdi Living
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Randy Butson and Magdlenar Gasser (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by video conference on August 19, 2021 and February 2, 2022. The
Landlord’s Agents, V. Diaz and R. Pereira, the Landlord's Legal Representative,
R. Bianchi, and the Tenants attended the hearing. The Tenants spoke with Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Section 49 (1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (‘the Act’) provides that a landlord
of a residential complex that contains no more than three residential
units who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the unit, may,
on behalf of the purchaser, give the tenant of the unit a notice
terminating the tenancy,
if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.     On April 28, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenants
with a Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser, or a
Family Member Requires the Rental Unit (N12) pursuant to section 49(1) of the Act with a termination date of June 30, 2021.
The Landlord indicated in the
notice that they entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale with a
purchaser who intends to move into the rental unit. The purchaser’s affidavit
dated November 27, 2021, confirmed that they intend to occupy the unit for at
least one year.
 
3.    
The Landlord presented a copy of the Agreement
of Purchase and Sale dated April 5, 2021.
The closing date for the sale has been moved several times because the Tenants are still in possession
of the unit. The amended Agreement of Purchase and Sale shows the current
closing date as February 15, 2022.
 
4.     The Landlord paid the Tenants
compensation equal to one month's
rent on June 30, 2021, by
e-transfer. Although, the Tenants stated
that they did not accept
the money until August




 
2021, I find that the Landlord
satisfied the requirement to pay the compensation no later than the termination
date in the notice of termination.
 
5.    
The Tenants testified that the
rental unit is the basement of a rental home and were sceptical that the purchaser
required their unit. They believed
the notice of termination was given in bad faith because the
advertisement for the unit
showed that it was an
‘investor’s dream’ and during the showings, the prospective purchasers turned up in expensive cars.
 
6.     The Tenants are in search for alternative accommodation and require
first and last month's
rent deposit for a new place. They have resided in the rental unit for about
four years and requested additional time to find a suitable unit.
 
7.     Based on
all the evidence, I am
satisfied that the Landlord has entered
into an agreement to sell the rental unit to the purchaser who requires
vacant possession of the rental unit and intends to reside there for at least one year. Without
more, the wealth of the purchaser
or words used in the advertisement do not demonstrate that the notice of
termination was given in bad faith.
 
8.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from
the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
9.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 1, 2018 to June
30, 2021
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. The parties
agree that this is a fair termination date.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The last month's
rent deposit shall be applied
to the last month of the tenancy
with interest on the last
month's rent deposit taken into consideration.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31,
2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April
1, 2022.

with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
