Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Keith Fournier


Tenant



 
 
Sara Gardner and Eric Chicoine
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Keith
Fournier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental
unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the
rental unit or the residential complex involving the production of an illegal
drug, the trafficking in an illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug
for the purposes of trafficking. The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video/teleconference on January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord Sarah Gardner
and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
The Tenant consulted with tenant duty counsel before the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord served the Tenant a
Notice of Termination N6 because the Tenant has committed an illegal act
involving the production of an illegal drug or trafficking in an illegal drug or possession of an illegal
drug for the purposes of trafficking in the
rental unit or residential complex
pursuant to section 61 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’). The Landlord alleged that the Tenant was growing 6 cannabis
plants, which exceeds the number of plants permitted under Cannabis Act
(S.C. 2018 c. 16) and Regulations enacted under the Cannabis Act.
 
2.     Section 61 of the Act states:
 
Termination for cause, illegal
act
61
(1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of
termination of the tenancy if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit
commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential
complex. 2006, c. 17, s. 61 (1).




 
Notice
(2)   
A
notice of termination under this section shall set out the grounds for
termination and shall provide a termination date not earlier than,
(a)                      
the
10th day after the notice is given,
in the case of a notice grounded
on an illegal act, trade, business or occupation
involving,
(i)          
the production of an illegal
drug,
(ii)        
the trafficking in an illegal
drug, or
(iii)       the possession of an illegal
drug for the purposes of trafficking; or
(b)                      
the 20th day after the notice
is given, in all other cases. 2006, c. 17, s. 61 (2).
Definitions
(3)    In this section,
“illegal drug” means a controlled substance or precursor as those terms are defined
in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada); (“drogue
illicite”)
“possession” has the same meaning as in the Controlled Drugs
and Substances Act (Canada); (“possession”)
“production” means,
with respect to an illegal
drug, to produce
the drug within
the meaning of the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada);
(“production”)
“trafficking” means, with respect
to an illegal drug, to traffic in the drug within the meaning of the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act (Canada). (“trafic”) 2006, c.
17, s. 61 (3).
 
3.    
The Tenant did not dispute that he
was growing 6 cannabis plants. According to the Tenant, he was not aware that it was against the law to grow 6 cannabis plants.
As soon as the Tenant found
out that growing 6 cannabis plants was illegal, he disposed of the plants and
has not grown any cannabis plants since.
 
4.     Based on the uncontested evidence
before me, I find that by growing
6 cannabis plants the Tenant has committed an
illegal act involving the production of an illegal drug in contravention of the
Cannabis Act.
 
5.    
Considering that the Tenant was unare that he was committing an illegal act by growing
6 cannabis plants and considering that the Tenant
had disposed of the cannabis
plants and undertook not to
grow any more cannabis plants, I find, in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Act, that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall not grow more cannabis
plants than permitted by law.
 
2.     If the Tenant fails to comply with this order, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without
notice to the Tenant
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s
breach of the order.
 
3.    
This order expires on January 24,
2023.
