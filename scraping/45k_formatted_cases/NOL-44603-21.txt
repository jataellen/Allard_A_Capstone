Between:


Robert Mclean


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Clarence Kewais


Tenant



 
Robert Mclean (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Clarence Kewais (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. This is the L1
application.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy
and evict Tenant because
the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. This is the L2 application.
 
These applications were scheduled by videoconference on January 19, 2022
at 9:00am.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Clint McLean, who holds power of attorney
for the Landlord, attended the
hearing when the matter was called at 9:19am.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 APPLICATION
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent increased to $607.00 effective January 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The arrears and costs owing
to January 31, 2022 total
$2,678.00.
6.    
The Landlord
seeks a standard
order. L2 APPLICATION




 
7.    
By way of background this is a month to month tenancy
in which rent is due on the first of the month in the amount of $607.00.
The tenancy commenced
approximately three years ago. The Tenant is the sole occupant
of the rental unit.
 
8.     The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a first N5 was given to the Tenant on
October 25, 2021 with a termination date of November 16, 2021, pursuant to
section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
9.     The N5 alleges
that the rental
unit was not prepared for pest control treatment scheduled for the
following dates: February 5, 2020; December 3, 2020; January 5, 2021; July 28,
2021; August 12, 2021 and August
19, 2021.
 
10.  The Landlord’s agent, Clint McLean, (CM) assists his
father in managing the property; some of his responsibilities includes
conducting plumbing work at the premises and minor
repairs around the property.
 
11.  CM described the residential complex
as a 11-unit apartment building
consisting of students and
elderly tenants. The Tenant’s unit is a bachelor apartment.
 
12.  CM testified that in 2020, a complaint of cockroach
infestation was made by the tenants residing above the Tenant. While consistent
treatments were made, the issue was not resolved and led to an infestation in the building.
Upon inspecting every unit, it was found that the Tenant’s unit had high
cockroach activity and that there was an excessive amount of clutter in the
rental unit.
 
13.  Treatments were scheduled building-wide but the pest-control technicians were unable to treat the Tenant’s unit due to an excessive amount of clutter and
a lack of preparation on the
Tenant’s part.
 
14.  The Landlord submitted reports from the ORKIN
technicians, all of whose comments were the unit could not be treated
because the unit was not prepared for treatment due to
poor sanitation and excessive clutter on February 5, 2020; December 3, 2020;
and
January 5, 2021.
 
15.  The Landlord submitted a report from Greater Sudbury
Pest Control for the treatments scheduled on July 28, 2021, August 12, 2021 and August 19, 2021 all of which state the treatment could not take place because
the unit was heavily cluttered and dirty and the Tenant did not make efforts to
clean or prepare for treatment.
 
16.  The Landlord submitted photographs of the rental unit showing items
such as clothing and garbage
bags scattered everywhere to the point
that the floors
were not visible.
In the kitchen, pots and pans and other items were piled high.
 
17.  CM testified that another treatment
was scheduled for October 31, 2021; the Tenant was not prepared and promised to be ready
for the next day. On November 1, 2021, the Tenant did not answer the door and
was not prepared for treatment.
 
18.  CM further testified that although the Landlord was
not advised of nor aware of any disability that the Tenant may have had, efforts were made by the Landlord
to help the Tenant clean up their unit and shift him to a larger
2-bedroom unit across the hall,




 
however the Tenant refused
the support from both the Landlord and Children’s Aid Society in this matter.
 
19. 
As such, the Landlord
seeks a termination of the tenancy.
ANALYSIS
20.  Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence with respect
to the L1 application for rent
arrears, I find the arrears and costs owing to January 31, 2022 total
$2,678.00.
 
21.  Based on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied
the Tenant’s repeated failure to cooperate with the Landlord’s efforts to effectively
treat the unit for cockroaches has substantially interfered with the other
tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and substantially
interferes with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. I say this based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence of multiple treatments scheduled for the unit without
success.
 
22.  Section 20 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') states:
 
A
landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex,
including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
 
23.  By not preparing the unit for effective treatment, the
Tenant is substantially interfering with the Landlord’s ability to comply with
their responsibilities under section 20 and conduct pest control treatments. This behaviour also interferes with the Landlord’s lawful rights, interests and privileges as it puts them in an
adverse position with other tenants and increases the Landlord’s liability.
 
24.  I do not find a conditional order to be appropriate
under the circumstances. The evidence before me was that the Tenant
was unwilling to completely prepare the unit.
 
25.  Based on my finding
on the L2 application, the tenancy is terminated and so there can be no opportunity to void
termination by paying the outstanding arrears claimed on the L1 application.
 
26.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $600.00
from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
27.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2019 to August 19, 2021.
 
28.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the
parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
29.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,793.79, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $19.96
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2022.
