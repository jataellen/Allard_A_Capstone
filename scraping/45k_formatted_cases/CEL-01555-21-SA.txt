Tenants



 
On July 15, 2021 Sunder Group of
Companies (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Pamela Russo (PR) and Ralph Russo (RR) (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the on consent
order issued by the Board on June 21, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-94688-20.
 
The Landlord's L4 application was resolved by ex parte order CEL-01555-21, issued on July 30,
2021.
The Tenants filed a motion to set aside order CEL-01555-21.
This motion was heard via video/teleconference on November 29, 2021.
The Landlord's Agent Tatisanna Shkarupina, the Legal Representative Geoff Paine, the Tenant
(PR) and the Tenant's Legal Representative Amanda Richards attended the
hearing.
Witness:
Kevin Fullerton (former Tenant
from #908)
 
Background and Determinations:
1.    
The order CEL-94688-20 issued June 21, 2021 on consent stipulated that the Tenants, their occupants or guests shall
not allow smoke to emanate into the hallways and into other units of the
residential complex.
2.    
The Landlord purported that on June 26, 2021 and on June 28, 2021 the Landlord
received complaints of excessive smoke smell emanating from the Tenants unit.
3.    
The Tenant (PR) did not dispute
the fact that she and her spouse are smokers,
that they continue to smoke,
but assert that following the hearing held on June 17, 2021 and that they agreed to the consent conditions in the order CEL-94688-20 issued June 21, 2021, that since then they both only
smoke on the balcony of the unit.
4.    
I am mindful that they have been
Tenants for nearly 30 years and on a balance of probabilities, the smell of smoke from repeated smoking
within the unit for such an
extended period of time would be near impossible to remedy 100%.




 
5.    
It is my view, the issue in the L4
application is the ambiguous wording of the consent terms the parties agreed to
in order CEL-94688-20 resulting in potentially differing interpretations.
Despite the fulsome testimonies given during the hearing, the end result is a ‘he said’ – ‘she said’
version of events
that do not meet the standard of proof required that evidence “must always be
sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of
probabilities test.”
6.    
Here, in my
opinion, and for those reasons, on any application, but especially on an
application like this, a landlord cannot simply make general allegations
against a tenant without sufficiently clear and convincing evidence and expect termination of the tenancy to follow.
7.    
A termination of a tenancy
must always be a remedy
of last resort, especially for long
term tenants.
8.    
While smoking cigarettes or
similar products is not prohibited by law, other tenant(s) are entitled to reasonable enjoyment
of their rented
premises, which includes
the right not to
be regularly subjected to second-hand smoke.
9.    
I was satisfied the frequency and impact of the
Tenant’s smoking has resulted in numerous complaints to the Landlord
that must be addressed and not ignored.
10.  All in all, after having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find
it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction by granting the Tenant’s
motion to set-aside ex parte order CEL-01555-21, issued on July 30, 2021
subject to the new condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act that
permits the Tenants one more opportunity to preserve their tenancy and correct their smoking behaviour in a
manner that respects the rights of other residents of the residential complex.
11.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside
Order CEL-01555-21, issued
on July 30, 2021 is granted.
 
2.     The order CEL-01555-21 is set aside and replaced
with the following order.
 
3.     Effective immediately and for the duration of the
tenancy, the Tenants shall refrain from smoking cigarettes or other
like products in the rental unit, including the balcony and all other
common areas of the residential complex and will not allow or permit smoke
or smoke like odor from any source to emanate from the
rental unit that rises to the level of
substantially interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex by other tenants or interferes with the lawful rights, privilege or
interests of the Landlord.




 
4.    
If the Tenants do not correct
their behaviour and fail to comply with paragraph 3 above, the Landlord may
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach
without notice to the Tenants, for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenants. The Landlord
must make this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants breaches
any of the conditions as set out in paragraph one above.
