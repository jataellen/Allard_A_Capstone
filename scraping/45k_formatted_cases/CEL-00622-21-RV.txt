Review Order
 
 
Mehrdad Hosseini
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Andreas
S. Gernack
and Dr. Paul Elliot (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-00622-21 issued on November
5, 2021.
 
On November
16, 2021, the Tenants requested a review of the order,
and that the order be stayed until the request to review the
order is resolved.
 
There were two
Interim Orders issued. Interim order
CEL-00622-21-RV-IN was issued on November 18, 2021, which conditionally stayed
the order CEL-00622-21, in order to permit the Tenants to pay $3,577.00 to the
Board in trust on or before November 25, 2021.
Interim order CEL-00622-21-RV-IN2 was issued on December
1, 2021, lifting
the stay of order CEL-00622-21, issued on November 5, 2021,
because the Tenants had not paid anything into the Board in trust on or before
November 25, 2021.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on December 10, 2021.
 
Only the occupant Itolo Malozzi and his legal
representative, P. Chmiel,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
A person claiming to be
the Tenant, Andreas S. Gernack, filed a request to review on November 16, 2021, alleging
that the order contains a serious error,
and that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing. It is not clear whether Andreas S.




 
Gernack filed the request
to review, or whether it was Itolo Mallozzi (IM) as his “representative” who signed the
request to review.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were not present
at the original hearing held on October
25, 2021, nor were
they present at the review hearing on December 10, 2021.
 
3.    
In fact, the issue of
IM’s standing before the Board was an issue at both the hearing on October 25,
2021, and on December 10, 2021. IM
alleges that he is the Tenants’ representative, however, there was never any
written authorization from either named Tenant
stating that IM could represent the Tenants before
the Board. This authorization
was not forthcoming at the review hearing, either.
 
4.    
The hearing held on
October 25, 2021, was held up all day, in order to provide IM the opportunity to prove he had standing
to represent the Tenants. When he
did not return
to provide this proof, the hearing was held on an uncontested basis late
in the day at 3:08 p.m., and a standard termination order was issued. The amount of arrears was
$53,377.00 to November 30, 2021, so the standard
termination order could only request a payment of $35,000.00, which is
the limit of the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
5.    
IM did not return
to the hearing on October
25, 2021, until 3:52 p.m.,
after the matter
had been heard. Andreas S.
Gernack, or IM, filed a request to review on the basis that the Tenants were
not reasonably able to participate in the hearing.
 
6.    
The request to review
was sent to a hearing, with a conditional stay on the standard termination order.
When the Tenants failed to pay $3,577.00
to the Board in trust on or before November 25, 2021, the conditional stay was lifted,
and the order CEl-00622-21,
issued on November 5, 2021, became enforceable.
 
7.    
Nevertheless, IM
attended the request to review held on December 10, 2021, with no documentary evidence
that he is authorized to represent the Tenants, and having failed to pay anything into the Board in
trust.
 
8.    
I find that IM has not
proved, on a balance of probabilities, that he is an authorized representative
of the Tenants with standing before the Board, nor has he proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing held on
October 25, 2021.
 
9.    
On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order
CEL-00622-21 issued on November 5, 2021, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.




 
2.    
The interim order,
CEL-00622-21-RV-IN2, issued on December 1, 2021, has already lifted the stay on the hearing
order. Order CEL-00622-21, issued on November
5, 2021, is enforceable.
