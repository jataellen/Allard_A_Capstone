Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26924-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UPPER, 52 LOUIS STREET PORT COLBORNE ON L3K1C5


 




Between:


Robert Harper Bashkim Lekaj


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Paul Girling


Tenant



 
 
 
Robert Harper and Bashkim Lekaj
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paul
Girling (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on February 1, 2022 with respect to
application SOL-23318-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $885.50 rent in full on or before February
1, 2022. The Tenant
did not pay $750.00 arrears on or before February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $10,047.00 for rent arrears
and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-23318-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $10,047.00 and that amount is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SOL-23318-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Order SOL-23318-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $10,195.70*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to February 24, 2022 and
the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $29.11
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before March 7,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 8, 2022.

The tenant has until March 6, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If
the tenant files the motion by March 6, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on September 8, 2022
if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
