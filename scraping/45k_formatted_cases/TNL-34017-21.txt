Yin Nei Tinny Hon (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sonia
Mardan (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires

of residential occupation.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on November

The Landlord, the Landlord’s spouse, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s

Determinations:
1.    
This is an application under section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
2.    
Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
3.    
On July 27, 2021 via courier the Landlord delivered to the Tenant a (N12) Notice
to End the Tenancy setting out
that the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the following
reason.
•        
use by the Landlord.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice
was September 30, 2021.
5.    
The Tenant did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the
notice given.
6.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed term, the end of the term.




 
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
7.     The Landlord stated that the compensation was deemed
paid to the Tenant by waiving deferred rent payable to the Landlord by the
Tenant totaling $2,520.00. The Tenant acknowledged that there was an agreement
for deferred rent from April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 amounting to $2,520.00
that as of the date of the hearing remained
owing to the Landlord.
 
8.     The Landlord filed
a declaration affirming their intention to take possession of the rental unit for personal use for a minimum
of one year.
 
9.     Based on the testimonies given and documentary evidence submitted, I find the Landlord
has met all the technical requirements pursuant to section 48 of the Residential
Tenancies Act.
 
✔ 
The N12 notice was properly given.
 
✔ 
A
Declaration was filed by the Landlord.
 
✔ 
The Landlord paid the compensation to the Tenant by waiving money owed to the Landlord
 
10.  The Landlord requested a standard order to termination of the tenancy.
 
11.  The Tenant testified that there was a previous
agreement to extend
termination of the tenancy up to March 31, 2022.
 
12.  The Landlord acknowledged that there was earlier
discussion on extending the termination date to March 31, 2022 but the Tenant
refused to sign a N11 agreement
to end the tenancy.
 
13.  The Landlord is now requiring
possession January 15, 2022.




14.  All in all, after considering all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to allow the Tenant
additional time to find alternative accommodation.
 
15.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the total amount owing to the Landlord on or before February
28, 2022 the Landlord has the right, at any time after March 1, 2022 to collect
the full amount owing or any balance outstanding under this order.
