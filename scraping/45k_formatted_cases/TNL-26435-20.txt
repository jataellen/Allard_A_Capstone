Order under Section

Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-26435-20
 
 



In the
  matter of:


16, 2 GEORGE
BOGG ROAD WOODBRIDGE ON
  L4L0A3


 




Between:


Samantha
  Frustaglio


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alejandrina Romas Christopher Garden


Tenants



 
 
Samantha Frustaglio (the 'Landlord') filed a request
to re-open the Landlord's application because Christopher Garden and Alejandrina Romas (the 'Tenants')
did not comply with the terms of their mediated settlement dated January 15,
2021.
 
This request
was heard in Passcode: 502 198 777# on January
13, 2021. The Landlord and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The
Landlord had served an N5 notice on the Tenants because of unpaid utilities. The Tenants agreed to pay the utility
bill on or before the 26th day of each month. A payment
was received by the Landlord 12 hours after midnight after the 26th day of the month.
 
2.    
The Tenants
now owe no unpaid utility
charges and have not been late with any other payments.
 
3.    
Under the
circumstances, the options are to re-open the Landlord’s application or deny
re-opening the application. Had the application been re-opened, my finding would have
been that the Tenants have paid the utility bills and continue to pay them. As such the application to terminate the
tenancy would be denied and the application dismissed.
 
4.    
Considering the fact
the Tenants have agreed to the terms of the agreement, I find it would
unreasonable to re-open the Landlord’s application. Instead I will leave the mediated agreement in place to ensure the Tenants
continue to pay the utility
bills on time.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's request to re-open
the application is denied.
