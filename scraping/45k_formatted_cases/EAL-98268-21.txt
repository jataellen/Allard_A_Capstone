Tenant



 
 
 
Dreammind (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Michael McElroy (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Beth Hernan, attended
the hearing. As of 11:12
a.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 2,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
January 31, 2022. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,214.40
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,200.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
31, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,089.41*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit.




File Number: EAL-98268-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
