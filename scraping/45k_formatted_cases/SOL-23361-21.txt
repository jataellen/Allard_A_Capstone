Tenant



 
 
 
City of Brantford Housing
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order determining whether
Brittany Deperry (the 'Tenant') altered the locking system without the
Landlord's consent.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 13, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord, represented by Jennifer Nichols,
attended the hearing.
The Tenant was not
present or represented despite being served with the notice of hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Subsection 35(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006, (the ‘Act’) requires that a Tenant
not alter the locking system during the Tenant’s occupancy of a rental
unit without the consent of
the Landlord.
 
2.     Subsection 35(3) of the Act outlines that the Board
may order a tenant
to pay the landlord the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses necessary to change the locking system if the
Board finds that the tenant has altered the locking system without the
landlord’s consent.
 
3.     The Landlord testified that they noticed the locks
changed on the Tenants rental unit when they attended
the unit for an inspection on April 15, 2021. The Landlord testified that the Tenant did not have the
Landlord’s consent to change the lock.
 
4.     The Landlord indicated that they spoke with the Tenant
regarding the locks and requested that they be provided
a key to the unit. It is the Landlord’s position that the Tenant refused to provide them with a
key because they indicated that guests keep stealing keys and the Tenant
indicated they wanted to feel safe.
 
5.     The Landlord testified that it costs $283.90 to change
the locks to the Tenant’s unit. The Landlord
indicated that this is the out-of-pocket expense
the Landlord previously incurred when the Tenant changed the locks previously on October
25, 2019.




File Number: SOL-23361-21
 
6.    
The Landlord further testified
that the Tenant has changed the locks again as of September 15, 2021 and have
not provided the Landlord with a copy of the key. The Landlord did not make submissions regarding claiming for the lock change
for September 15, 2021.
 
7.    
The Landlord is seeking
the cost to replace the lock in the amount
of $283.90 based
on the April 15, 2021 date the Tenant changed the locks.
 
8.    
The Landlord also seeks an order
for the Tenant
to reimburse the Landlord for the $201 application filing fee.
 
9.     Based on the uncontested evidence
of the Landlord, I am satisfied that the Tenant
has altered the rental unit’s locks, and has done so without the
Landlord’s consent and without providing the Landlord with a key.
 
10.  I find that the Landlord
is entitled to the reasonable out-of-pocket cost to replace the locking system in the amount of
$283.90.
 
11.  Since the Landlord
is successful on their application, I also find that the Landlord is entitled to the application filing fee
cost in the amount of $201.00
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$283.90 which represents the reasonable cost for
changing the locking system.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.     The Total amount
the Tenant must pay to the Landlord
is $484.90.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
