Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35302-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1111,
  9090 YONGE STREET RICHMOND HILL ON L4C6Z9


 




Between:


Masoud Shani
Shokofeh Shahsavarani Amini


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Mostafa Bakhshipour


Tenant



 
 
 
Masoud Shani and Shokofeh
Shahsavarani Amini (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Mostafa Bakhshipour (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlords also claimed NSF cheque charges
and related administration
charges.
 
This application as heard by videoconference on January 31, 2022. The Landlord Shokofeh Shahsavarani Amini
and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Michael Pilieci attended the hearing. As of 2:20 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 13, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $2,150.00.
 
4.      The Landlords incurred charges of $28.00 for cheques
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF and $80.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,150.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlords.




File Number: TNL-35302-21
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 20, 2019
to October 13, 2021.
 
7.     
The Tenant paid $1,500.00
after the application was filed.
 
8.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant
and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as
set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $11,478.73*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $70.68 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 23,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $15,144.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated; and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection
74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The




File Number: TNL-35302-21
 
Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
