Mak


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lucas Jenkins


Tenant



 
 
 
Ming Fai Mak (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lucas Jenkins (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex
have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was heard on February
15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative Andrew
Choubeta attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has vacated the rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
