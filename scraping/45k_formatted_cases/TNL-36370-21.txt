Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36370-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


30 BUTTERFLY HEIGHTS KLEINBURG ON L4H3N5


 




Between:


Sravanthi Vundemodalu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Romy Kalathiparambil
  Tasha Barry


Tenants



 
 
 
Sravanthi Vundemodalu (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Romy Kalathiparambil and Tasha Barry (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 20, 2022
at 9:16 PM.
 
The Landlord, Sravanthi Vundemodalu, and the Tenant,
Romy Kalathiparambil, attended
the hearing. The Landlord was
represented by Jasleen Narula.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is based upon an N12 notice given under section
48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), served
on October 22, 2021, with a termination date of December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
submitted a tenancy agreement between the Landlord and Tenants for a term of
one year commencing November 15, 2019. The
agreement said that the rent was due on the 15th day of each month.
The tenancy was not renewed
at the end of this term, and therefore became a
month-to-month tenancy on the same terms as the previous tenancy agreement, in
accordance with section 38 of the Act. Rent
has continued to be due on the 15th of each
month. The monthly period of the
tenancy therefore commences on the 15th day of each month.
 
3.    
Under and subsection 48 (2) of the Act, an N12 notice must set a termination date that is “the day a period of the tenancy ends.” The period on which a tenancy ends is the
day prior to rent being due under the lease.
The N12 served on October 22, 2021 was accordingly invalid as rent is
due on the 15th of
each month. The termination date of
December 31, 2021 was an improper termination date, as the day the period of
this

tenancy ends is the 14th of a month. This defect
voids the notice
and renders the Landlord’s application ineffective.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
