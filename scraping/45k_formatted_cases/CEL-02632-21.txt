In the matter
of:


41 ADMIRAL ROAD
WASAGA BEACH ON L9Z1H2


 




Between:


Antonietta Marincola


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jasmine
Hnatiak Stephen Hnatiak


Tenants



 
 
 
Antonietta Marincola (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Stephen Hnatiak and Jasmine Hnatiak (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 15, 2021.
The Landlord’s legal representative, T. Philp, and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Tenants had an opportunity to speak with Tenant Duty Counsel before the hearing began.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
Section 82
 
1.   
The Tenants wanted to
raise section 82 issues for me to consider offsetting against the arrears. The
Tenants had served on the Landlord and filed with the Board a substantial
number of documents. The Tenants had not served a list of section 82 issues on the
Landlord or filed one with the Board.
 
2.   
Pursuant to section 82
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), a Tenant is
permitted to raise any issue that could be the subject of an application if the Tenant
complies with disclosure requirements or provides an explanation satisfactory to the Board explaining
why the Tenant could not comply. Section
82(2) requires a Tenant to give advance
notice to the landlord of the
Tenant’s intent to raise the issue at the hearing and this notice shall be in
writing.
 
3.   
The Tenants
submitted that they did not serve a list of section 82 issues on the Landlord or file it with the Board because
they were not aware this was required.
 
4.   
This matter was
previously adjourned. The Interim Order required the parties to serve and file any list of section 82 issues in accordance with section 82 of the Act. The Tenants




 
submitted they only received the Interim Order the day before the
hearing. However, irrespective of whether
the Tenants received
the Interim Order on time,
the Notice of Hearing
that the Tenants would have received in regards to the initial hearing is
accompanied by documents, one of which includes a blank form that a tenant can
complete regarding maintenance or other tenant issues. The Tenants ought to
have known their disclosure obligations to raise section 82 issues.
 
5.   
As such, I did not hear the Tenants’
evidence regarding the maintenance issues
in their unit. However, it should be noted that this does not preclude
the Tenants from bringing their own
application. They may wish to contact their local legal clinic to get advice in
this regard.
 
Determinations:
 
6.   
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to October 29, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 3, 2021.
 
7.   
The Landlords
transferred ownership of the unit to a new landlord
on October 29, 2021.
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application
was filed.
 
8.   
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,000.00.
 
9.   
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
10. The Tenants paid $1,000.00 after
the application was filed.
 
11.
As the Landlord
transferred ownership to a new
landlord, the Landlord’s L1 application has
been amended to an L9 application solely for the arrears of rent and the filing
fee. The amount outstanding is $5,065.26, inclusive of rent arrears to
October 29, 2021 ($4,879.26) and the application filing fee ($186.00).
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord $4,879.26*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
