Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11585-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


16 WATERSTONE STREET RICHMOND HILL ON L4E0P8


 




Between:


Chang Liu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Yola Sementilli


Tenant



 
 
 
Chang Liu (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yola Sementilli
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because the Tenant has been persistently late paying rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Lyndsay Dubois attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 15, 2018 to January
14, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective June 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,850.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 25, 2017 to June 29, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $26,000.00 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant has been persistently late paying rent.
 
6.    
Because the Tenant has been persistently late paying rent this order cannot be voided by the Tenant.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s representative requested additional time for the Tenant to vacate the rental unit.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 14, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $8,880.70*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$88.77 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 15, 2022.

In accordance
with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 15, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has
territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
