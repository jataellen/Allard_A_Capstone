In the
  matter of:


UPPER LEVEL, 113
PRIMEAU DRIVE AURORA ON
  L4G6Z6


 




Between:


Hai Wang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jessica
  Odorico


Tenant



 
 
 
Hai Wang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica
Odorico (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due and the Tenant
stopped paying rent to the Landlord in September 2021.
 
2.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
20, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-34601-21
 
5.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
