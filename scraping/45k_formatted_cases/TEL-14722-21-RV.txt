Review Order
 
Chengcheng Yang
and 11243535 Canada Ltd (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jason Alexander Stephen Mccullough (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes; and determining that the Tenant or another
occupant of the rental unit
has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry
out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the
residential complex involving the production of an illegal drug, the
trafficking in an illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug for the
purposes of trafficking.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-14722-21 issued on September 8, 2021. On September
24, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
On September
27, 2021 interim
order TEL-14722-21-RV -IN was issued,
staying the order issued
on September 8, 2021.
 
The review
request was held by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Representative, Ge Wen Dai and the Tenant’s
Representative, S. Harvey attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s Representative stated he did not receive the Notice of Hearing because the Board sent the Notice to the
incorrect email address. He also indicated he did not receive an application
number for the application filed.




File Number: TEL-14722-21-RV
 
2.    
On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
3.    
The Board’s record
shows the Notice was mailed to the same email address, daigewen@hotmail.ca, the Landlord’s Representative provided on the application and at
the hearing.
 
4.     The Board also sent the Notice to the
Landlord at his email address chengchengycc@hotmail.com which is the same email address the Landlord included
on the L1 application. The
Landlord did not attend the review hearing to testify about whether he received
the Notice.
 
5.    
Pursuant to subsection
191(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’) the Notice is deemed to have been given 5 days after mailing.
Rule 5 of the Board’s
Rules of Procedure gives the
Board the discretion to serve a Notice of hearing by email in appropriate
circumstances. As the Board is operating in the middle of a pandemic it was
reasonable that the Board issue the Notice to the Landlord and his
Representative electronically via email.     In this case the Notice was sent
on June 1, 2021 at 8:34 a.m. which is deemed received on June 6, 2021.
 
6.    
The Board’s
electronic file does not show that the emailed Notices
bounced back/ or was
returned as “undelivered”. It’s common knowledge that email is very reliable
and the likelihood of both emails being lost in cyberspace is extremely low.
 
7.    
This is not a situation where the Landlord
or his Representative provided evidence
that the Notice was directed or received in their junk mail.
 
8.    
The Landlord’s Representative claim that he did not receive
the application fee is not feasible. The application was filed
on December 14, 2020. An application cannot be scheduled without an application
number.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order TEL-14722-21 issued on September
8, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.    
The interim
order issued on September 27, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order TEL- 14722-21 is lifted.
