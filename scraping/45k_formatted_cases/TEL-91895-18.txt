B.V Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M.L. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 27,
2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
representative, S.F., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 30, 2018.
2.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,125.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2014 to April 30, 2018.
4.    
The Tenant stated he went
into arrears when he lost his job in January 2018, but he got his job back
three months ago.  He requested a repayment plan of $400.00 a month, which
would take 10 months to complete.
5.    
The Landlord opposed this
request stating the parties had the same agreement before coming to the Board,
but the Tenant did not uphold the agreement.  The Landlord went on to say that
the Tenant has been carrying a balance owed for a long time and he has
attempted to work with the Tenant on getting him paid up.  The Landlord is no
longer willing to work with the Tenant because the Tenant does not adhere to
any agreement they make.
6.    
The Tenant agreed they had
the repayment plan in place before and he was not able to keep it.  
7.    
Given the above evidence, I
find a remedial order will not change the Tenant’s behaviour.  Also, the Tenant
failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim of regular
payments.  
8.    
The Tenant asked for a delay
in termination of three months without appropriate support for the request.  I
find this to be unreasonable and an order with standard terms shall issue.
9.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
10.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
10, 2018.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,773.78*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 30, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $39.76 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 10, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 10, 2018, then starting August 11, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 11, 2018.
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)       $5,149.06 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)      $6,358.28 if the payment is made on or before August 10, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after August 11, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
