AMENDED ORDER
 
This amended order is issued
to correct a clerical error in
the original order issued January 4, 2022. The
amendment is bolded and underlined for ease of reference.
 
 
Ashley Knack and Scott Knack (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leslie Gomes and John Cardoso (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
6, 2021. The
Landlords and the Landlord’s Employee, Ellen
Goodfellow attended the hearing. As
of 3:40 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented
at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental
unit.




 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made
no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
1, 2019 to August 18, 2021.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords
$7,450.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,986.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust,
this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
