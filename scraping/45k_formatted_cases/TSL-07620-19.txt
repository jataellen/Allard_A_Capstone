Landlord’s L1 application
 
A B (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict C F (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Tenant’s T2 application:
 
C F (the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that A B (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance
obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or
failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
Tenant’s T6 application:
 
C F (the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that A B (the 'Landlord') the Landlord's
agent, his son T, entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system
on a door giving entry to the rental unit or residential complex without giving
the Tenant replacement keys and substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a
member of the Tenant's household.
 
These applications were heard in Toronto on
July 30, 2019.
 
The Tenant and the
Landlord’s son T B (TB) and the Landlord’s Legal Representative L W attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary issue
regarding bias 
 
1.   
These parties had previously appeared before me
and I issued an order terminating the tenancy. The Tenant informed me today
that he has appealed that decision to the Divisional Court.  The Tenant
asked me to recuse myself because he felt that I would likely be biased against
him now that I realized that he had appealed my earlier decision.  
2.   
There is presumption of judicial impartiality and the threshold to
establish bias is high. [R. v. S. (R.D.) 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), 1997 3 S.C.R. 484]
3.   
The legal test of a reasonable apprehension of bias is “Whether an
informed, reasonable and right-minded person, viewing the matter realistically
and practically, and having thought the matter through, would conclude that it
was more likely than not that the trial judge would not decide fairly.” [Bailey
v. Barbour 2012 ONCA 325].
4.   
The Landlord did not object to my presiding over the hearings.
5.    The fact that the Tenant has appealed an earlier decision that I
issued does not satisfy this test. I did not recall
the parties or the previous case until I heard from the Tenant that he appealed
my decision.  I had no doubt of my ability to determine the issues
in this case in an impartial manner, and I do not believe that an
informed, reasonable and right minded person would conclude differently.  I proceeded accordingly.
 
Determinations on
the L1:
 
6.   
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2019 to September 30,
2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 4, 2019.
7.    The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
8.    The monthly rent is $1800.00.
9.    The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
10. The Tenant
has made no payments since the application was filed. 
11. The Tenant
does not dispute the arrears claimed.  He explained that he stopped paying rent
to pending the outcome of his two applications.  
12.
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), additionally, the Tenant filed a T2 and T6 and as
result a determination must be made into whether relief from the eviction is
appropriate because the Landlord is in serious breach od his obligations under
the Act as set out in s. 83(3)(a).  For the reasons that follow below, I am
satisfied that the Landlord is not in serious breach of the Landlord’s
obligations under this Act, therefore I find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant is not
entitled to withhold rent once he has filed applications at the Board. 
Tenant’s T2
application 
 
13.
The Tenant alleges that the landlord
substantially interfered with his reasonable use and enjoyment of the rental  because:
14.
 TB who is the Landlord’s son and also acts the
property manager, attended the residential complex for unknown reasons on the
following dates: April, 17, 2018, April 29, 2018, May 3, 2018, May 15, 2018,
May 31, 2018, June 4, 2018, June 5, 2018, June 19, 2018, September 6, 2018;
15.
TB attended on the grounds as late as 8:00 p.m.
to mow the lawn;
16.
TB unlawfully entered his rental unit to apply a
pest control treatment;
17.
TB changed the locks to residential complex
without providing the Tenants with notice and in doing so failed to accommodate
the Tenant’s injury as he required to under the AODA and other comparable
legislation.
18.
For the reasons that follow; the Tenant’s T2
application is dismissed;
Unnecessary visits to the residential complex:
 
19.
The Tenant testified that he had logged the
number of times when he observed the Landlord on the premises between April 17,
2019 and September 6, 2019  The Tenant viewed the TB’s presence on the property
as a form of harassment because the Tenant complained to the Electrical Safety
Authority (ESA) about the rental unit.  
20.
TB agreed that he was at the residential complex
on the dates noted.  TB explained that he was at property, though not in or
near the Tenant’s unit, for the following reasons:
(a)  To
respond to maintenance requests made by another tenant in the residential
complex;
(b)  To
cut the grass and prepare the garbage bin for pick up;
(c)  To
meet with a new tenant in the property and exchange keys;
(d)  To
change the locking mechanism for the front door; and
(e)  To
respond to a complaint about a possible trespass and install security cameras; 
21.
The rental unit is one of three in the complex. 
The building primarily houses students who are transitory.  The Tenant admitted
that he was unaware that other residents required TB to attend to their
needs.   
22.
Based on the testimony of the parties I am not
satisfied that the Tenant has established that the Landlord substantially
interfered with his use and enjoyment of his rental unit by attending at the
residential complex during the period April 1, 2018 and September 6, 2018. The
Landlord was the residential complex for legitimate purposes including addressing
the maintenance needs of the other tenants of the residential complex.
 
Locks
changed 
23.
Section 24 of the Act states:
24 A
landlord shall not alter the locking system on a door giving entry to a rental
unit or residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during
the tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement
keys.  
 
24.
TB did not dispute the Tenant’s evidence that on
or about July 18, 2018 he replaced the existing lock system that required the
residents to lock the main entrance door with key when they exited with a self-locking
system.
25.
The parties agree that entry key remained the
same only the locking system changed.  
26.
TB explained that he wrote the residents of the
property on July 18, 2018 and explained that he switched the door knob and lock
because of a safety situation brought to his attention by the parents of the
two tenants who reside in the middle floor unit.  he was notified that one of
the female students arrived home late on night and found the main entrance door
ajar and identified it as a safety concern.    
27.
TB testified that when he investigated the
complaint, he discovered that the main door to the property was often left
unlocked and he felt to an automatic locking device would be safer, especially
for the units occupied by the female students. 
28.
TB testified that the property is near Humber
College in Toronto and to make his units appealing to students and their
parents he takes security seriously which includes installing security systems
and making sure that the doors lock properly. 
29.
At no time was the Tenant unable to enter the
residential complex due to the Landlord’s installation of a new locking device.
TB produced a copy of his notice to the Tenants of the property letting the
them that he had changed the knob and installed an auto lock system.  His
message also confirmed that the keys remained unchanged.  The Tenant did not
dispute being able o use his main entrance key to gain access after the new
door knob and auto lock system were installed. 
30.
Based on the testimony of the parties, I am not
satisfied that the Tenant has proven that Landlord changed the locks to the
rental unit illegally and failed to provide the Tenant with a key.  
Failure to
Accommodate injured wrist:
 
31.
The Tenant alleged that Landlord breached his
obligation to accommodate a disability/ injury to the Tenant’s right arm.  The
Tenant testified that he preferred the old door knob and locking system to the
new one due to his wrist injury.  
32.
The Tenant asked to have the old locking system
returned to the property. However, it was unclear how the new locking system
and door knob would affect his injury.  The Tenant provided a medical note from
his specialist which explained the nature of his physical issue.  The medical
note suggests that the Tenant can manage his discomfort by modifying his
activities.  
33.
The Tenant acknowledged that he had not notified
either the Landlord or TB that he required accommodation prior to filing his
application.  
34.
It is settled that law that accommodation is a
collaborative process.  A tenant is required to notify a landlord of any issue
requiring accommodation. In this case, the Tenant did not notify the Landlord
that he required accommodation.  Therefore, I cannot find that the Landlord
breached its obligation to accommodate the Tenant prior to hearing date.
35.
Furthermore, the evidence does not establish
that the Tenant continues to require the requested accommodation TB relied on
video evidence which he submitted to show that the Tenant has full range of
motion and use of the wrist he alleged is injured.   The video shows the Tenant
using a variety of tools to remove his tire, lug nuts and alternator. The
images also depict the Tenant using his injured hand to open the door with the
new door knob.  Therefore, based on the evidence of the parties, I am unable to
determine that the Tenant suffers from disability that requires the
accommodation he has requested.
Unauthorized
entry to spray for ants:
36.
The Tenant also alleged that the Landlord
substantially interfered with use and enjoyment of the rental unit by entering
the unit illegally on May 22, 2018 to spray it for ants.  
37.
TB’s submitted an invoice given by Orkin the
company hired to spray for ants, which confirms that it was basement apartment
that was sprayed for ants and not the Tenant’s unit.  Any odours the Tenant
smelt in his unit likely travelled up from the basement.  
38.
Therefore, the Tenant’s T2 application shall be
dismissed as I am not satisfied that Landlord, TB or Orkin accessed the
Tenant’s unit on May 22, 2019 to spray for ants. 
 
T6 application
Tenant’s
evidence:
39.
The Tenant claims that the Landlord breached his
maintenance and repair obligations under s. 20 of the Act because the rental
unit is not air conditioned and the Tenant is unable to operate a large
portable air conditioner in his bedroom.  
40.
The Tenant explained that when he attempted to
operate the air conditioner in June 2018 his lights flickered and eventually
shut off.  
41.
The Tenant notified TB who responded immediately
advising the Tenant to operate the air conditioning unit from the larger
bedroom at the back of the rental unit and open the doors  allowing the cool
air to circulate.  
42.
When the problem persisted between June 1, 2018
and August 8, 2018, the Tenant contacted the Electrical Safety Authority (ESA)
and arranged to have one of its investigators look into the wiring.  
43.
The investigation by the ESA concluded that air
conditioner was overloading the outlet the Tenant plugged it into and that
unless the Landlord added a new fuse/amp to the circuit breaker or the Tenant
used different plug, the problem would persist.  
44.
The ESA investigator did not issue a work order
or provide a written report citing any ESA violations against the Landlord. 
Instead they explained that the solution could be a few hundred dollars and a
new fuse added to fuse box.   
Landlord’s Response:
 
45.
TB agreed that the electrical wiring in the
residential complex could be updated if they chose but they have never been
ordered to do so by the ESA.  TB explained that he and his father own several
small residential complexes and they allocate capital improvements/expenditures
annually based on the immediate need of each property.  
46.
TB explained given the age of the property, they
do not offer air conditioning in the property that houses the rental unit
because they know that the wiring is older.  They have never objected to
Tenants using their own air conditioning unit provide that they did so within
safe parameters.   
47.
TB argued that previous tenants have used
portable air conditioning units in the rental unit without incident because
they operated the portable units safely.
48.
TB explained that he sent his own
electrician out in August when the Tenant complained that the problem
persisted.  TB testified that his electrician inspected the electrical outlet
in the rental unit and found that they were functioning appropriately.  
Analysis:
 
49.
Section 20 of the Act states:
20 (1)  A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining
a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of
repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health,
safety, housing and maintenance standards.  [emphasis added]
50.
There is no dispute between the parties that TB
responded within hours to the first compliant regarding the power outage. 
There is also no dispute that he responded quickly each time the Tenant
complained.  
51.
The key issue raised in this application is whether
the Tenant is entitled to operate any appliance from anywhere within the rental
unit that he choses.  In other words, is it a breach of the Landlord’s
obligation under section 20 to limit the Tenant operation of the air
conditioning unit to the spare bedroom at the back of the rental unit. 
52.
The ESA investigated the rental unit and did not
find that the Landlord was in breach of any standard relating to the electrical
wiring. Further, it cannot be said that the Tenant’s inability to place his air
conditioner in the room of his choosing makes the rental unit unfit for
habitation.
53.
Thus, in order for the Tenant’s claim to be
successful he must establish that the fact that the existing wiring in the
residential complex is insufficient for the Tenant’s air conditioner other than
in one of the bedrooms means that the rental unit is not in a good state of
repair
54.
Under contract law a landlord is obliged to
ensure that the tenant receives the entire bundle of rights he contracted for. 
The Tenant’s interpretation that he enjoys unfettered use and access to the
rental unit is in correct, however, he should receive exactly what he
contracted for.  Here the lease did not include an air conditioning unit. Therefore,
the Tenant does not have an automatic entitlement to be able to operate his air
conditioner anywhere in the rental unit. 
55.
Further, the electrical wiring does operate as
intended – it provides a supply of electricity so long as the circuits are
overloaded. What the Tenant wants the Landlord to do is improve or upgrade the
electrical system so that it is capable of running an air conditioner anywhere
in the rental unit
56.
Therefore, I find that the Landlord did not fail
to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act.  An
important distinction must be made between a landlord’s maintenance and repair
obligations under section 20(1) that would trigger an automatic inquiry into
whether a tenant has been deprived of something he or she contracted for, and
the situation we have here, where two separate qualified electricians
investigated the Tenant’s complaint and concluded that the wiring did not need
repair.  The Tenant’s claim is based on his view that he is entitled to operate
the air conditioning from any room in the unit so chooses.  
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November 11, 2019.
2.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$10,642.42*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
October 31, 2019.
3.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 1, 2019 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before November 11, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from November 12, 2019 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If the unit is not vacated on or before November
11, 2019, then starting November 12, 2019, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be

8.      If the Tenant wishes to void this order and

ii)       $12,775.00 if the payment is made on or before November 11, 2019**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after November 12, 2019 but before the

make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
10.   The Tenants T2 and T6 application are denied.
