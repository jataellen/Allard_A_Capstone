Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-19257-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


2112, 10 HOGARTH AVENUE TORONTO ON M4K1J9


 




Between:


Montcrest Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Mcgrath


Tenant



 
 
 
Montcrest Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kevin Mcgrath (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on February
7, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative Sean Beerd and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December
9, 2020.
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,511.73 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     The monthly rent is
$1,554.99.
 
4.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 9, 2020.
 
6.    
The Landlord testified that the Tenant is in arrears $28,032.90 inclusive of costs and filing fee. The Tenant did not dispute the
amounts outstanding.
 
7.     I asked both parties on submission on eviction. The
Landlord submitted they are seeking on 11-day order for eviction. The Tenant stated they were asking an extension on eviction
until March 31, 2022.




File Number: TSL-19257-20
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 15, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I
find that the proposal of March 31, 2022 to be excessive as the Tenant has not
paid the monthly rent since September 2020 that would be over 18 months without
paying the monthly rent.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $25,591.91*, which represents the amount
of rent owing and compensation up to February
16, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $50.79
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 17, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 15,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 15, 2022, then starting
March 16, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 16, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$27,995.82 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$29,540.81 if the payment
is made on or before
March 15, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
