Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11929-21
 



In the matter
of:


106, 400 LYLE
STREET LONDON ON N5W0B9


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenants




 


Ivica
Propadalo Jozo Propadalo


 



 
 
 
Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Ivica Propadalo and Jozo Propadalo (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Rawan Hussein, attended the hearing. As of 2:00 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,415.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord sent letters to the Tenants on the
necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,415.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2020 to December
31, 2020.




 
8.    
I have considered all of
the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act. The amount outstanding is
substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent since the application was
filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $5,938.86*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.52 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,676.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 18, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
