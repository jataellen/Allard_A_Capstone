In the matter
of:


416 ELM ROAD TORONTO ON M5N3W5


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Gartner


Tenant



 
 
Jun Rong (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael
Gartner (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Emrick Shi.
 
Determinations:
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE: LANDLORD’S CLAIM IN EXCESS
OF THE BOARD’S JURISDICTION
 
1.    The amount of arrears outstanding exceeds the $35,000.00 monetary jurisdiction of the
Board.
 
2.   
The Landlord was made aware of the fact that by proceeding with this application, all rights the
Landlord may have in excess of the Board’s monetary jurisdiction are
extinguished once the Board issues its order.
 
3.    The
Landlord opted to proceed with their claim for rent arrears at the Board. L1 APPLICATION
4.    The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
May 15, 2021 to November 14, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 9,
2021.
 
5.    The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
6.    The lawful monthly
rent is $7,300.00 and is due on the fifteenth
of each month.
 
7.    The Tenant paid $7,300.00 after the application was filed.




 
8.   
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $7,300.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
9.    Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 16, 2021 to July
9, 2021.
 
10. The arrears and costs owing to February
14, 2022 total $58, 586.00.
 
11. The Landlord seeks an expedited
standard order. TENANT’S
EVIDENCE
12. The Tenant does not dispute
the arrears as claimed
by the Landlord.
 
13. The Tenant testified that he was not able to comply
with the interim order by paying the rent for December
15, 2021 due to a loss of employment. While the Tenant is
back to work now, he has put income towards other bills and has not
been able to pay the rent for January 15, 2022 either.
 
14. The Tenant testified
that he required a brief extension to surrender vacant
possession of the rental unit
to the Landlord by February 10, 2022. He explains this is due to multiple
bookings for moving trucks, the last of which is scheduled for the requested
date.
 
15. The Tenant confirmed
that he does not wish to preserve
this tenancy or propose a repayment plan for the rent arrears.
 
16. At the end of the hearing, the Tenant indicated
he was agreeable to a standard order. ANALYSIS
17. Based on the evidence before
the Board, I find the arrears and costs owing to February 14, 2022 total $58,586.00. This
is undisputed by the parties.
 
18. With respect to the Landlord’s request for expedited
eviction, expedited evictions are generally available for serious situations involving dangerous behaviour
or criminality.
 
19. Paragraph 74(3)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
states:
 
An order of the Board terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant in an application under section 69 based on a
notice of termination under section 59 shall,
 
…
 
(b) inform
the tenant and the landlord that the order will become void if, before the order
becomes enforceable, the tenant pays to the landlord or to the Board
the amount required under subsection (4) and specify that amount;
 
20. This means the Board is mandatorily required
to provide the Tenant with another
opportunity to avoid
eviction by paying the Landlord the arrears of rent and costs
outstanding.




 
21. In general, orders
are mailed to all parties.
Pursuant to subsection 191(3) documents that are mailed are deemed to be received
five days after mailing.
 
22. So if the Board issues
an order saying the Tenant has
less than eleven days to void rather
than the standard eleven days the Board usually allows, the maximum time period
the Tenant will have to void is six days if the mail arrives on time.
 
23. What this means
is that the Landlord’s request
for an expedited order
runs a very high risk of the Tenant being effectively
deprived of the right to void that the Board is mandatorily required to give under the Act. Although the Board certainly
has the discretion to do as the Landlord requests it seems to me that
doing so in the absence of very exceptional circumstances and expedited service
on the Tenant, would be contrary to the spirit of the Act. Whether or not the
order is expedited, the quantum of rent arrears will remain the same.
 
24. While I can empathize with the Landlord about the
excessive quantum of arrears outstanding, I am not prepared
to exercise my discretion and shorten the voiding period from the standard eleven days as
requested by the Landlord in this instance.
 
25. As the Tenant is agreeable to a standard order, I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant,
and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
26. This order contains
all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$240.00 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 29, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 9, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.    
Pursuant to subsection 207(1) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) the Board may not order payment
of an amount more than the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims
Court, which is $35,000.00.
I do
not believe this applies to the amount to
be paid if the Tenants wish to void the order, as this is an optional
payment.
 
9.     If,
on or before February 8, 2022, the Tenant
pays the amount of $58,586.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
