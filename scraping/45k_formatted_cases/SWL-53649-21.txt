Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-53649-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


204, 69 DOWNIE STREET STRATFORD ON N5A1W7


 




Between:


Theocharis Brothers Properties Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Gemus


Tenant



 
 
 
Theocharis Brothers
Properties Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Richard Gemus (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 15, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Carmen Dowdy, attended the hearing. As of
10:03 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord was informed that the Tenant had passed
away on October 5, 2021. Section 91 of the Residential Tenancies Act states, “If a tenant of a rental
unit dies and there are no other tenants of the
rental unit, the tenancy shall be deemed to be terminated 30 days after the
death of the tenant”. Taking this into consideration the Tenant remains
responsible for the unit until November 5, 2021.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $643.00.
 
4.     The Tenant had made no payments after the
application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $600.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2014 to August 3, 2021.




File Number: SWL-53649-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
5, 2021, thirty
(30) days following the death of the Tenant, when the Landlord was able
to reclaim vacant possession of the unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,027.24*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
5, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
