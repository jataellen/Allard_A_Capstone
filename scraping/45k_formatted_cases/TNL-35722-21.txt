File Number: TNL-35722-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 79 HART BOULEVARD NEWCASTLE ON L4B1E4


 




Between:


Jorge Moya


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Darcy Sims Steve
Westkirk


Tenants



 
 
 
Jorge Moya (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darcy Sims and Steve
Westkirk (the 'Tenants') for the because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
Further, the Landlord
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
The hearing was held by videoconference on January 6th,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, Sassan Emam attended the hearing. The Tenants names were called
10:21 am and there was no response. Despite the Notice
of Hearing Mail package
being returned to the Board, I was satisfied that the Tenants were properly
served by e-mail.
 
L2 Application
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The
Landlord’s representative advised
me that the Tenants had moved out of the unit as of November 29th, 2021. As
such, the Landlord’s representative requested that the L2 application with
respect to the N12 be withdrawn.
 
L1 Application
 
2     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay
for the period from August
1, 2021 to August 31st, 2021, and from October 1st, 2021 to November
29th, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective September 13, 2021.




 
3.    
Considering that the Tenants
vacated the unit on November 29th, 2021, this application now transitions to an application for rent arrears
under s. 87 of the Residential Tenancies Act (the “Act) only.
 
4.    
The monthly rent was $1,400.00, due on the 1st of each month.
 
5.   
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. Further,
 
6.   
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from September 27, 2019 to November 29th, 2021.
It is ordered that:
 
7.   
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2968.48,
which represents the amount of arrears
owing to November 29th, 2021 ($2767.48), the application fee
($201.00), less interest owing on the deposit.
 
8.    If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 28,
2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 29,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
9.    The Landlord’s L2 application based on and N12 noticed
is hereby dismissed.
 
 
January 31st,
