Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-87815-18










 
 

G. T. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict C. L. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and has
been persistently late paying the rent.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on February 9, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 16, 2018.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018 total $2,900.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,450.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2017
to January 16, 2018 totalling $3.36.
THE APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT
6.     The
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Since
August of 2017 the Tenant has never paid rent on time.
7.     The
tenancy is a month to month tenancy.
8.     The
lawful monthly rent is due on the first day of the month.
RELIEF
FROM EVICTION
9.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify refusing or delaying eviction.
It is
ordered that:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated for non-payment of rent.  The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 23, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $596.47*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $47.67 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 23, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 23, 2018, then starting February
24, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 24,
2018.
8.      If,
on or before February 23, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,090.00** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this part of the order for eviction will
be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated for non-payment
of rent and the Tenant could remain in the unit until March 31, 2018.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 24, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
THE
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENT LATE PAYMENT
10.   The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31,
2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2018.
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2018.
