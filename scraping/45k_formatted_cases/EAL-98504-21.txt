In the matter
of:


D, 315 CRAIG
HENRY DRIVE NEPEAN ON

Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennah Robichaud
  Matthew Palmer


Tenants



 
 
 
Minto Multi-res Income Prtnrs 1, Gp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Jennah Robichaud and Matthew Palmer (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s representative, A. Skelly, attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,464.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to September 28, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $1,988.43 after the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,640.25*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
22, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$51.43 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 6,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:

$5,677.41 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,241.81 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
