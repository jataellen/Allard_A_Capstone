Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57655-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


08,
  91 HIGH STREET LONDON ON N6C4J8


 




Between:


Jama Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jack Helmer


Tenant



 
 
 
Jama Property Management (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jack Helmer
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to
application SWL-50979-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $752.81 rent on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenant did not
pay $100.00 arrears on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $915.84 for rent arrears
and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-50979-21.
The amount that is still owing from that order is $550.09
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-50979-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-50979-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,476.15*. (Less
any amount paid since the application was filed on January 25, 2022.) This
amount represents the rent owing up to February 7, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.75 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 18, 2022, then starting
February 19, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 19, 2022.

The tenant has until February 17, 2022
to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 17, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 19, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
