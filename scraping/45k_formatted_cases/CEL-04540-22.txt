Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04540-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


201, 200 QUEEN
STREET S MISSISSAUGA ON
  L5M1L3


 




Between:


Rockview Properties


Landlord




 


 
And


 




 


Gabriel Kadis


Tenant



 
 
 
On February
4, 2022, Rockview
Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gabriel Kadis (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on
January 5, 2022 with respect to application CEL-27779-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The previous order
CEL-02279-21 is an order terminating the tenancy made under Section 69 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), which on its face provides that the
tenancy is terminated and the terms of the order enforceable without further
recourse to this Board, unless voided by the Tenant in accordance with the
terms contained in the order and the provisions of the Act.
 
2.   
An L4 application is an application made under section
78 of the Act, and must be founded
upon a pervious order that contained an express provision that entitles the
Landlord to apply for an order under section 78.
 
3.    The previous order
contains no such section 78 provision, and therefore cannot
sustain an application under
section 78.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act
is dismissed.
 
2.    
Order CEL-27779-21, issued on January 5, 2022 remains
in effect.
