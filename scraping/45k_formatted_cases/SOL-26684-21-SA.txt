Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Showayne Marley


Tenant



 
Malleum Real Estate Management
Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Showayne Marley (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June 15, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-17817-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order SOL-26684-21, issued on January 13, 2022.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order SOL-26684-21.
 
This motion was heard
by videoconference on February 9, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord’s Agent,
Cooper Donmoyer, attended
the hearing. The Tenant
consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant testified that he operates a moving company
that has slowed down in the past several months. He said he owes “back taxes” on the business to the government
as well, and he has tried looking
for other jobs, even part-time
jobs, but nothing
has really worked out in this
regard.
 
2.     The Tenant also testified that his payment on or about
December 1, 2021 was made through the portal
that is used to pay the Landlord, but due some e-payment issues that happened because
of other payments
being made at the same time, his payments were not made.
 
3.     The Landlord’s Agent
clarified this through
his own testimony, stating the one payment
attempted to be made by the Tenant for $1,219.71 was returned ‘NSF’.
 
4.    
Further, the Landlord’s Agent also testified
that the Tenant
has only been
making
$1,219.71 “arrears” payments since the June 15, 2021 (original) order issued, and has
missed every one of the monthly rents from July 1, 2021 to the present.
 
5.    
The Tenant opted not to cross-examine the Landlord’s Agent.




 
6.    
In reply, the Tenant admitted the
December 2021 payment came back to him ‘NSF’. Further, he testified that he honestly
misunderstood the June 15, 2021 order, stating
that he never really looked at or read the payment terms carefully.
 
7.     In an attempt to explain his position going forward,
the Tenant stated he has $500.00 right now to place against the arrears owing,
and would like to repay his arrears under a new payment plan, thereby
maintaining his tenancy intact. If
his motion is denied, the Tenant indicated he has no hard feelings
toward the Landlord
and he requested a couple of months be granted him to be able
to move out. The Tenant pointed out
that he has been a tenant for the past five years.
 
8.     The Landlord’s Agent submitted that the Tenant
currently owes $7,557.10 in rent arrears (including the filing fee) up to February 28, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent stated the Tenant
did not comply with the June 15, 2021 original
order that had been issued because of the Tenant’s own proposal at the
time, and the Tenant has not shown anything to suggest that the Tenant’s
position had really changed in the past months, or now has improved. The Landlord’s
Agent requested the motion to set aside be denied and the stay lifted immediately.
 
9.    
Based on the submissions of the parties,
I find that the Tenant’s
motion is to be denied.
 
10.  Firstly, the motion to set aside was filed by the
Tenant on January 18, 2022. In the
Tenant’s motion, he declared that his December
1, 2021 payment
had been successfully made/completed, but it was
only a timing issue when he paid through the portal. However, it was clear at
this hearing that the December 1, 2021 was not successful, which means the
Tenant knew this well ahead of time when he filed his motion to set aside and
made his declaration.
 
11. 
Secondly, while I can accept the Tenant’s honest
belief that the June 15, 2021 order only
had one monthly payment to make ($1,219.71), it cannot be ignored that the June
15, 2021 order clearly sets out payments of rent every month on the 1st day of each month, along with the arrears repayments also due
for payment on the 1st day of each month.
 
12.  Thirdly and finally, the Tenant’s testified-to
circumstances were not supported by any evidence, but even so, it appears
to me that the Tenant’s
circumstances surrounding the breaches were the same circumstances
pled during the original hearing that led to the June 15, 2021 order (reference paragraph 4 of the Determinations section in that order).
 
13.  Having heard the Tenant’s request for some extra time,
I indicated I was prepared to postpone the lifting of the stay to March 11,
2022, thus giving the Tenant one month to prepare to move. However, I stated I would only order a
postponement if the Tenant were to pay the Landlord the $500.00 he said he has
immediately available to pay. In this way, the prejudice
to the Landlord is made lower, when I consider
the record which shows the Landlord is also holding a
last month’s rent deposit.
 
14.  I set a
deadline for the $500.00
payment to the Landlord to occur on or before February 11, 2022. I also directed the Landlord’s Agent to confirm with the Board in writing about whether the $500.00 payment was
successfully received. I set a
deadline for the




 
Landlord’s post-hearing submission, that is, 5:00 pm, February
14, 2022. I indicated that if no reply were received, I would
interpret that as a “positive” confirmation that the postponement of the lift
is to happen.
 
15.  As of the issuance date of this order, I confirm that
the Landlord’s Agent, or anyone else for the Landlord, has not sent into the Board any communication as I had directed. While I cannot confirm determinatively
whether the Tenant actually paid the $500.00 to the Landlord, I do find that the postponement of the lift will be granted, so that the stay will be
lifted on March 11, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside
Order SOL-26684-21, issued
on January 13, 2022, is denied.
 
2.     he stay of order SOL-26684-21 is lifted on March 11, 2022.
