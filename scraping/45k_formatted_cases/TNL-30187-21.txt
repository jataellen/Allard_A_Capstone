Landlord




 


and


 




 


Hamed Nabizadeh


Tenant



 
Canadian Mental Health Association Toronto Branch (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Hamed Nabizadeh (the 'Tenant') because
a)    
the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.; and because
b)    
 the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant.
 
The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant
to compensate the Landlord for the damage and claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on November
25, 2021.
The Landlord’s Agent Joy Xioa, the Landlord's Legal Representative Eliza
Lowes and the Tenant attended the hearing.
The Tenant’s support worker
was also in attendance to aid the Tenant. The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex is a high-rise multi unit
apartment building that the Landlord as a Mental Health Supportive Housing service provider rents units to clients
requiring housing assistance.
2.    
On November 13, 2020 the building
property management company
responded to a flooding incident in Unit #717. It was
later determined that the source of the flood originated in the Tenants’ rental
unit #917.
 
3.    
The Tenant claimed that he fell asleep and accidently left the water
running in the kitchen
sink that overflowed in the unit and water
from there seeped through the lower floors and flooded other units
#817, #717, #617 and #517.




4.    
The Landlord’s Agent asserts
the Landlord incurred costs
of $3,809.24 to repair the damage.
 
5.     On December 13, 2020 the Landlord gave the Tenant a
first N5 notice alleging that the Tenant has negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit and to
other areas of the
residential complex and requested the Tenant to pay for the cost of the damage
repairs.
6.    
Subsection 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act states:
“A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant
substantially interferes with the lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord
or another tenant.”
 
7.     Section 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006,
(the ‘Act’) provides that the type of N5 Notice served by the Landlord is
void if the Tenant, within seven (7) days after receiving the notice stops
the activity or corrects the conduct/behaviour. In this case, the
N5 was served on December 13, 2020, which means the seven (7) day voiding
period ran from December 14, 2020 to December 20, 2020.
 
8.     The Tenant did not pay the Landlord
for the cost of
the damage repairs.
 
9.     The Landlord's Legal
Representative submitted a copy of the damage breakdown of the charge back
to the Landlord for the cost to repair in the respective other units:
•        
$1,139.00 to the Tenants’
Unit #917
•        
$1,096.00 to Unit #817
•        
$395.45 to Unit #717
•        
$847.00 to Unit #617
•        
$330.53 to Unit #517
•        
$3,807.98**
 
10.  Based on the uncontested testimony of the Landlord’s
Agent, I was satisfied that the Tenant negligently caused
undue water flood damage to the rental
unit and to other units
in the residential complex.
 
11.  I was satisfied
by the evidence submitted that the Landlord
has incurred costs of
$3,807.98 to repair the damage
and/or replace property
that was damaged.
 
12.  The Landlord seeks a standard
order to terminate the tenancy.
 
13.  The Tenant requested a repayment plan to repay the
Landlord for the damages. The Tenant stated he could pay $50.00 per month in addition to the
monthly rent towards the amount
owing.
 
14.  I denied the Tenants’ request
for a monthly repayment of $50.00.
The term of repayment based on
$50.00 per month would take seven plus years to repay.




15.  Terminating a tenancy
should always be the last resort. In this instance, the damage was not wilful, deliberate but rather
caused by negligence. The Tenant does not dispute his responsibility.
 
16.  All in all, after having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
I find that it would not
be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Tenant shall be permitted additional time
to pursue relief from eviction financial assistance.
 
17.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within
the order. No other reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,807.98, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay the total amount
owing** to the Landlord on or before
April 30, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
April 30, 2022, the Landlord may apply to the Board under section 78 of
the Act, within 30 days of the breach without notice to the Tenant, for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before April
30, 2022, he will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 30, 2022, the Landlord has the right anytime after May 1, 2022 to collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding
balance as a result of this order.
