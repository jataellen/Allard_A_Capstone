Tenancies Act, 2006

Review Order
 
SR (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict KM and DS (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the
damage.
 
The Landlord’s application was resolved by order
CEL-71370-17, issued on January 30, 2018. 
 
The Tenants requested a review of
that order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing in accordance with Rule 29.11 of the
Board’s Rules of Practice.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants attended the
hearing that took place on January 25, 2018. Their tenancy was terminated in order CEL-71370-17, issued on January 30, 2018. However, the
eviction or move out date was delayed by one month to February 28, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants are understandably disappointed with
that result. Yet, a review is not
an opportunity to reargue your case in hopes of a more favourable outcome. Nor
is it an opportunity to present evidence and submissions that could and should
have been presented at the original hearing.
3.     
On the basis of the
submissions made in the request, and after listening to the recording of the
hearing, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that
a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
4.     
The Tenants allege that there
is a serious error in the order because the order fails to give adequate
reasons for the determinations made by the Member. In particular, they allege
that the order should have stated the exact amount of utilities that the
Tenants owe to the Landlord. This does not amount to a serious error. 
5.     
The order does not require
the Tenants to pay the Landlord the amount of the unpaid utilities. Therefore, stating
the exact amount was not necessary. The N5 Notice of Termination and the application
state the exact amount of unpaid utilities the Landlord claims is owing. The Board’s
file and the recording of the hearing reveal that the Landlord provided a spread
sheet at the hearing which identified the amount owing as of the hearing date.
As a result, the Tenants were aware of the amount that was claimed to be owing.
Also, paragraph 12 of the review request reveals that the Tenants were aware of
the amount for unpaid utilities since they refer to the amount as “only a
little more than…the Tenants’ monthly rent.”
6.     
The failure to provide full
reasons for the determinations made does not amount to a serious error that
would justify a review of the order. The Board hears a very large volume of
cases. Due to this volume, full reasons for the decision are not provided with
every order. However, Rule 26.2 of the Board’s Rules of Practice states that a
party can request reasons for the decision within 30 days of the order. If the
Tenants required more detailed reasons they could have requested those reasons.
There is no record of any such request.
7.     
The Tenants allege that the Member
failed to fully consider their circumstances under section 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’). They state that
they have a fixed, limited income, have three young children and a move will be
difficult for the family. The hearing recording reveals that the Member asked
the Tenants more than once near the conclusion of the hearing if there was
anything else they wanted to say or add to their evidence. The Tenants had a
full opportunity to explain all of their circumstances. Paragraph 9 of the
order reveals that the Tenants’ family circumstances were considered and this
was the reason for the delayed eviction date
8.     
The remedies that are ordered,
including the termination or eviction date, are within the discretion of the Member
who heard all of the evidence and submissions from both the Landlord and the
Tenants. The reasonable exercise of discretion will not be interfered with on
review.
9.     
The N5 Notice of Termination that the Landlord’s application is
based on is dated October 11, 2017 with a termination date of November 2, 2017.
The N5 notice alleges that the Tenant have failed to pay the utility bills from
February 2017 to October 2017. The Tenants allege that it was a serious error
for the Member to consider the state of the utility accounts as of the January
25, 2018 hearing date and only the timeframe in the N5 notice should have been
considered.
10.  
This is not a serious error.
The Member is required, under section 83 of the Act, to consider all of the
circumstances in deciding whether to terminate the tenancy. For example, if the
utility accounts were fully paid by the hearing date, the Member may have
determined that relief from eviction would not be unfair. Therefore, events
that have occurred since the application was filed may be considered if they
are relevant to the issues in the application.
11.  
The review request is denied
in accordance with Rule 29.11(c) of the Board’s Rules of Practice because the
grounds for considering a review are not satisfied.
It is ordered that:
 
The request to review order CEL-71370-17, issued on January
30, 2018, is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
