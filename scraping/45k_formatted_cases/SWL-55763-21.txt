Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Guy Zink (the 'Tenant') because

whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and, find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject

2022.

The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:

Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
•        
The Tenant shall
pay $200.00 towards arrears and costs for the next fourteen months
on or before the 15th day of the month, commencing on or before February 15, 2022 and ending on or before March 15,
2023.

an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph

breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
