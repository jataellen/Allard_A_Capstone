File Number: SOL-24865-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
B6, 171 CALEDON AVENUE HAMILTON ON L9C3C9


 




Between:


Victoria Park
Community Homes


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tom Windsor


Tenant



 
 
 
Victoria Park Community Homes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Tom Windsor (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 11, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Lange, attended
the hearing. As of 2:13 p.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 2,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is
$1,113.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,062.32 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to August 2, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $4,901.01 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$789.99, which represents the arrears of rent
($615.99), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:
 



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




January 20, 2022


$400.00
(costs and arrears)




February 20, 2022


$389.99
(arrears)



 
 
(b)  
The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the month of
February 2022 in full, on or
before the first business day of the month.
 
3.     If the Tenant
fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest
rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
