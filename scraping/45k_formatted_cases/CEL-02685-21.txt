Ashraf Mehrazar Romina Kiebadroodi


Tenants



 
 
 
Mtn Forming Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Romina Kiebadroodi and Ashraf Mehrazar
(the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or a person
the Tenants permitted in the residential complex have seriously impaired the
safety of any person.
 
This application
was heard by video/teleconference on January 6, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, David Howell,
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
1.     This application is based on a notice of termination
served on the Tenant pursuant to section 66 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). That section permits a landlord to give a tenant a
notice of termination if an act or omission of the tenant seriously impairs
the safety of another person, provided that the act or omission complained of occurs in the residential complex (Form N7). This means that the Landlord
must establish that the effect or potential effect of the Tenant’s actions threatens
the well being or physical integrity of another person to such a degree that
termination of the tenancy is reasonable in order to ensure the safety of
others. In other words, have the Tenant’s actions put someone at serious risk
of physical harm?
 
2.     The allegations set out on the Notice of Termination
consisted of noise disturbances. There was nothing
on the face of the Notice of Termination indicating that the Tenants seriously impaired the safety of
anyone.
 
3.    
As noted at the hearing, I find that the Landlord
served the wrong Notice of Termination
on the Tenants.




File Number: CEL-02685-21
 
4.    
It may well be that the Tenant’s actions
substantially interfere with the Landlord’s and the other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of the premises or interferes with another lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord, as contemplated by section 64 of the
Act. But this is an application based on a notice served pursuant to section 66
of the Act.
 
5.     As a result,
the Landlord’s application shall be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
