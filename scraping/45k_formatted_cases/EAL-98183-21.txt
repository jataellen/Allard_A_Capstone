In the matter
of:


415 FOSTERBROOK WAY NEPEAN ON K2J0K8


 




Between:


Ruba El-abdallah
  Ihab Chabayta


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Alyssia Klyne
  Jaymes Lee


Tenants



 
 
 
Ruba El-abdallah and Ihab
Chabayta (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Alyssia Klyne and Jaymes Lee (the 'Tenants') because they have been
persistently late in paying their rentThe Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ Representative Ashley Wilson,
supervised by Miriam
ValePater and the Tenant, Alyssia Klyne attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The tenancy
agreement required the Tenants to pay rent on the first day of each month,
however, the parties agreement rent is due on 20th day of
each month. The N8 Notice with termination date of December 19, 2021 complies
with section 58(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.     The Tenant does not dispute
they have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,950.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 9, 2020 to
December 31, 2021.

5.    
The Landlord requested per diem compensation after the date of
termination on the N8 Notice (December
19, 2021) because
the Tenants paid no rent which was not disputed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
7.     The Tenants do not want to preserve
their tenancy. The Landlord consents
to the Tenant’s request for
an extended termination date of February 28, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $2,598.36, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 20, 2021 to February 28, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$64.11 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from March 1, 2022 to the
date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before March 11, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
