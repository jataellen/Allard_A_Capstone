Order under Section 57
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TET-95981-18
 
 
 
 
HB, HK, and AI, (the 'Tenants')
applied for an order determining that MM and SM (the ‘Landlords) and MIH,
and SN (the ‘Purchasers’) gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 20, 2021, at 9 A.M.
 
The Tenants, the Landlords, the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Mr. SS, the purchaser, Mr. MD IH, and
the purchasers’ Legal Representative, Mr. MA,
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants submitted this application on October 12, 2018, alleging
that the N12 notice
of termination was served in bad faith and the purchasers never moved into the
rental unit.
 
Background
 
2.    
On May 13, 2018, the Landlord
served the Tenants
with an N12 notice of termination
with a termination date of July 14, 2018 claiming the purchaser of the
residential complex requires possession of the rental unit for residential
occupation.
 
3.    
On May 13, 2018, the Landlord
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants
because the Landlord
had entered into an agreement of purchase and sale
of the rental unit and the purchasers, Mr. MD IH and Ms. SN, require possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.




 
4.    
A hearing for the Landlord’s application
was held on July 10, 2018. At the hearing, the Landlord and Tenant consented to an order (TEL-92190-18) that includes the following
terms:
 
1. 
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of July 25,
2018. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 25, 2018.
 
6. The Landlords will pay to
the Tenants the sum of $4,000.00 in exchange for vacant possession of the rental unit.
If this money is not given then on July 26, 2018 the full amount will become due and
payable and the Landlords will owe to the Tenants 3% interest per year in
addition to the main amount.
 
8. This order settles
all matters arising from this tenancy to date and neither
party will file any other application, action, claim or commence any proceedings against the other party related to this
tenancy in any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
5.    
The Tenants moved out of the rental unit on July 25, 2018.
 
6.    
The rental unit was purchased by Mr. MD IH and Ms.
SN on July 31, 2018.
 
Tenants’ evidence and submissions
 
 
7.    
The Tenants testified they
expected the Purchasers to move into the rental unit following completion of
the sale of the property, based on as declaration completed by the purchasers
on May 23, 2018. That declaration states that the Purchasers confirm they are
going to use #8 Forbes Road, as their principle residence. The declaration was
submitted as a “sworn affidavit” and submitted as part of the L2 hearing
on July 10, 2018, but without
it being sworn by a commissioner of oaths and without being a witnessed.
 
8.    
In late August 2018 the Tenants returned
to the rental unit to collect mail, and
discovered the Purchasers had re-rented the rental unit to two other
tenants and had not move into the rental unit themselves.
 
9.    
The Tenants are not alleging of bad faith
related on the part of
Landlords, but only with
the Purchasers.
 
10. 
The Tenants entered a new lease on
September 1, 2018, at a rental of $2800.00 per month, representing an increase
of $800.00 per month from their rent at the rental unit. In addition,
because they couldn’t move into their new residence until September 1, 2018,
they incurred additional moving expenses of $2700.00.
 
11.  The Tenants are seeking an abatement of $3000.00, $9600.00
in rent differential (based on new rent difference of $800.00 x 12 months), moving
expenses of $2700.00 and the cost of filing the application.




 
Landlords’ evidence and submissions
 
12. 
The Landlords’ Legal Representative submitted the consent
order requiring the Landlord to provide
vacant possession to the purchaser was adhered to by the Landlord,
including the requirement to pay compensation to the Tenants.
 
13. 
The Landlords’ Legal
Representative submitted that the purchasers’ declaration was accepted in good faith
by the Board in the consent order of
July 25, 2018,
the Tenants moved out and
vacant possession was provided by the Landlord to the Purchaser. Therefore, in
his submission, the Purchasers were bound by the Act’s requirements.
 
14. 
The Landlords’ Legal
Representative submitted that it was not the Landlords’ fault the purchaser chose
not to move into the rental unit. Additionally, he submitted that because
the Landlords fulfilled their responsibilities under the Act, they should be absolved
of any responsibility in this matter and the purchaser should shoulder any
findings arising from the hearing.
 
15. 
The Landlord's Legal
Representative also submitted that based on the fact there was a consent order
issued by the Board, where both parties agreed to the terms of the order, any additional financial
compensation awarded to the Tenants would constitute “double- dipping.”
 
 
Purchasers’ evidence and submissions
 
16. 
The Purchaser, Md IH, testified
they did not know anything about an N12 notice or L2 application filed by the
Landlords. The Purchasers were asked by their Realtor to sign a declaration indicating they intend to move into the rental
unit or risk the loss of a
$20,0000.00 deposit. The Purchasers’ representative submitted their Realtor
misled the Purchasers.
 
17. 
The Purchaser also initially
testified they did not know that Tenants were living in the rental unit, but under cross-examination acknowledged that they were aware of the fact the Tenants resided in the unit.
 
18. 
The Purchaser also alleged
that the seller
and buyer agents
colluded somehow against the Purchasers, and they were
pressured to sign the declaration.
 
19. 
The Purchaser testified that initially they intended to move into the rental unit but change their minds at their daughter’s request and opted not
to move into the rental unit. The Purchaser asserted they did not have any
obligation to advise the other parties of any change in plans that they did not
intend to move into the rental unit. They also asserted that this hearing was a
“waste of his valuable time” and the “Tenants already got their money” from the
seller of the property.




 
20. 
During cross examination the
Purchaser confirmed that the purchase agreement entitled them to inspect the rental home,
and on two more occasions they spoke with the Tenants during these visits, and
indicated to them that they intended to move into the rental unit.
 
21. 
The Purchasers’ legal representative asserted the Purchasers did not sign the declaration under oath and didn’t
understand their obligations at the time, and the Purchasers’ lawyer also did not advise them of such an
obligation.
 
22. 
The Purchasers’ legal
representative also submitted the Purchaser did not have any responsibility to
the Tenants as they did not understand their obligation to move into the rental unit.
He also submitted that the Tenants took the payments of compensation
in the Board’s consent order and
have now applied for more financial compensation.
 
Analysis
23.    This application was made pursuant
to subsection 57(1)(b)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) which reads:
 
57(1) The Board may make an order described
in subsection (3) if, on application
by a former tenant of a rental unit, the Board determines that,
 
(b) the landlord gave a notice of termination under
section 49 in bad faith, the former tenant
vacated the rental unit as a result of the notice or as a result of an
application to or order made by the Board based on the notice, and no person referred to in clause 49 (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d) or 49
(2) (a), (b), (c) or (d) occupied the rental unit within
a reasonable time after the former tenant vacated the rental unit.
 
24.    Subsection 57(1) (b) of the Act articulates a three-part test. In order to be successful,
the Tenants must establish all three of the requirements of subsection 57(1)(a) on a balance
of probabilities:
•       
the Tenants vacated the rental unit as
a result of the N12 notice or a Board order
based on the N12 notice:
•       
the purchaser
did not move into the rental unit within a reasonable time after
the Tenants vacated; and
•       
the Landlord gave a notice of termination under section 49 of the Act (the N12
notice) in bad faith
 
25. 
There is no dispute
the Tenants vacated the rental unit on July 25, 2018, as a result
of an eviction order issued
by the Board based on an N12 notice of termination for purchaser’s own use
served under section 49 of the Act.
 
26. 
The Purchasers do not dispute the Tenants’ evidence
that the Purchasers failed to move into the
unit after the Tenants vacated, and instead re-rented the rental unit to two
other tenants.
 
27. 
The leaves the issue of whether
the N12 notice was served in bad faith. I accept that there is no bad faith on
the part of the Landlords – they served the Tenants with the N12 based on the Purchaser’s declaration on May 23, 2018, stating that the Purchasers’ intent




 
was to move into the rental unit as their principle
residence. I find the Landlords
in this matter fulfilled their
obligations to the Tenants and acted in accordance with the Act.
 
28. 
I
do however find that the Purchasers acted in bad faith.
 
29. 
The Purchasers contend they were misled by their Realtor, misinformed by their lawyer, and misunderstood their
obligations when signing the declaration/affidavit claiming that they intended
to live in the rental unit as their primary residence.
 
30. 
I
find the Purchaser’s explanation implausible. There
was no reason provided as to why the
Purchasers’ own Realtor
would mislead or pressure them into signing
a declaration, they knew to be false.
 
31. 
Further, I find the Purchasers
gave inconsistent evidence on key issues, which undermines their credibility.
The Purchasers initially denied knowing the Tenants occupied the rental unit at all, but later acknowledged that
they had spoken with the
Tenants during inspections and told the Tenants that they intended
to move into the
rental unit.
 
32. 
The Purchasers’ explanation that
they decided not to move into to the unit based on their daughter’s request was unsupported by any evidence and falls well short of constituting a reasonable explanation for their failure to move into the
unit.
 
33. 
The Purchasers’ allegations of a collusion between
the sellers and Realtors
in this matter are without any evidentiary basis.
 
34. 
Based the evidence and testimony submitted, and on the balance of probabilities, I find
the Purchasers are responsible for breach, and are appropriately named as the
sole respondents in this T5 application. Therefore, the applications are amended to remove the Landlords as parties
 
35. 
I
next need to consider
whether release clause
contained in paragraph 8 of consent order TEL-92190-18, issued on July 25,
2018, prevents the Tenants from pursuing this claim.
 
36. 
The Purchasers were not a party
to the proceeding that resulted
in order TEL-92190-18, and therefore the release
clause does not apply to the Purchasers and does not restrict the Tenants’
ability to pursue a claim against the Purchasers in this matter. The compensation paid to the Tenants by
the Landlord related to the termination of the tenancy in order TEL-92190-18,
and does not serve to excuse the purchaser from their obligations under the Act
or allow them to escape liability for any breaches of the Act.
In addition, the breach
at issues here, the fact the purchasers did not move into the rental
unit after the deal closed, only occurred after order TEL-92190-18 was issued.
A release clause cannot be reasonably interpreted as allowing a party to commit
subsequent breaches with impunity.




 
Remedies
 
37. 
 I find that the Purchasers shall
pay an abatement amount of $2000.00 representing the rent the Tenants would
have normally paid in the month of August 2018, as they could not move into their new rental unit until September 1, 2018, and had to make other urgent accommodation arrangements.
 
38. 
I also find the Purchasers shall pay
to the Tenants the amount of $9600.00, representing the difference in rent the Tenants
were forced to pay in their new rental unit over
a period of one year -
September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019.
 
39. 
Finally, I find the Purchasers shall
also pay $2700.00
for the Tenants’
moving expenses and $50.00
for the cost of filing this application to the Board.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Purchasers shall pay to the Tenants
a rent abatement of $2,000.00.
 
2.    
The Purchasers shall also pay to the Tenants
$9,600.00. This amount
represents all the increased
rent that the Tenants have incurred from September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019.
 
3.    
The Purchasers shall also pay to the Tenants
$2,700.00, for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the Tenants
have incurred for moving expenses.
 
4.    
The Purchasers shall also pay the amount of $50.00, representing the amount of the filing fee for this application.
 
5.      
The total amount the Purchasers owe the Tenants is $14,350.00.
 
6.    
The Purchasers shall pay the Tenants the full amount
owing by March 6, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Purchasers do not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by March 6, 2022, they will owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from March 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
outstanding balance.
 
8.    
The Tenants have the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
