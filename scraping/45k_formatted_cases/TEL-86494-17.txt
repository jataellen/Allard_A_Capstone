B.W.C.F. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Z.B. and B.S. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. L1 application
 
And
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date. L2 application
 
This combined application was heard in Toronto on
January 31, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, S.A.A. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
            
            L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to
January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 21, 2017.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,330.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 25, 2017 to November 21,
2017.
4.     
The Tenants paid $2,720.88
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
6.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
7.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
            L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
23, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $587.19*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $44.35 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 13, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 23, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 23, 2018, then starting February 24, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 24, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before February
23, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,890.62** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 24,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application
10.   If the Tenants void the part of this order relating to the L1
application as set out in paragraphs 8 above, the Tenant shall pay the monthly
rent on or before 1st day of each month, starting March 1, 2018 and
continuing up to and including February 1, 2019.
11.   If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
as set out in paragraphs 10 above, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Act, within 30 days of the breach, without notice to the Tenants,
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
