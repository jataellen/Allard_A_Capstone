Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02639-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
E.L
and Y.K.L (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict G.H (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes. 
 
This
application was resolved by order HOL-02639-18 issued on May 4, 2018.
 
On
May 11, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order, and that the order be
stayed until the request to review is resolved.
 
On
May 11, 2018, order HOL-02639-18-RV-IN was issued, staying the order issued on
May 4, 2018.
 
The
request was heard in Toronto on June 28, 2018.
 
The Landlord, E.L, the Landlords’ legal representative, J.L, and
the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Request
for Review
1.      The
Tenant testified that he did not receive the Notice of Hearing and would have
attended the hearing if he had received it.  The residential complex is a large
building with 48 floors of units and the mail is received in a locked box in
the mailroom.  The Tenant acknowledged that he received the order and the
Notice of Review by mail, but testified that he has received at least four
pieces of mail for other units, and notes that many of the other units are vacant
or have tenants who are away for long periods, so would not have been available
to pass on his mail if it had been delivered to the wrong box, or would simply
have discarded it.  The Tenant also acknowledged he had received the N4 as it
had been slipped under his door.  No mail for the Tenant has been returned to
the Board. 
2.      The
Tenant also testified that transfers he made for rent do not appear to have
been credited to him in the order.  
3.      I
accept the evidence of the Tenant that the Notice of Hearing was not received
by him and that he would have attended at the hearing had he received notice of
it.  The request for review is granted.
Arrears
of Rent
4.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective March 27, 2018.
5.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
6.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $3,600.00.
7.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
8.      The
Landlords incurred charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to 3 cheques
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
9.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $3,600.00 from the Tenant and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
Section
82 Issues
10.   The
Tenant testified that there were significant disrepair issues in the unit since
July 24, 2017 when a flood from the unit above substantially damaged the
ceilings in the kitchen and bathroom.  
11.   The
Tenant further testified that he contacted the Landlord and steps were taken to
resolve the issue in the unit above but that this took considerable time.  When
repairs were still not made in September, he testified that he asked the Landlord
to waive the rent for October considering the inconvenience of the constant
worry of further leaking and the lack of repair to the ceilings.  The Landlord
did not cash the cheque for the October rent.  The parties agreed that they
were convinced that the work would be completed by the end of October.
12.   The
Tenant testified that an additional escape of water from the upper unit
occurred again in November.  The unit above’s owner claimed repairs had been
done, but the problem was clearly not resolved.  The Tenant acknowledges that
the Landlord continued to be responsive and pursued both the owner of the unit
above and the property management company.  The Tenant testified that further
repairs apparently occurred and there was testing of the repairs on January 26,
2018, which failed.  
13.   The
Tenant testified that the testing was finally successful on February 15, 2018
and the contractors came in to repair the kitchen and bathroom ceilings and had
all the work satisfactorily completed by February 27, 2018.  The Landlord then
deposited rent cheques for October 2017, and February and March 2018 on March
16, 2018.  The cheques were returned for insufficient funds and the Landlord
served the N4 Notice in March.
14.   The
Tenant testified that he felt unsafe around the ceilings in the kitchen and
bathroom and was concerned they would collapse, so stopped using those two
areas from July 24, 2017 through to February 27, 2018 when they were finally
repaired.  He testified that he used bathrooms in the hotel area of the residential
complex and at his gym and either ate out or brought takeaway meals in.  He
also testified that the damage prevented him from finishing the furnishing of
the unit as he put on hold purchasing anything new and that he did not feel he
could invite any guests.  
15.   The
Tenant acknowledged in his testimony that he runs his consulting business from
the rental unit and works from home, though says he also worked from client
sites and from Starbucks.  He also acknowledged that the Landlord responded
positively to all his requests for assistance with the leaks and that he and
the Landlord had a good relationship up until March, 2018 and had worked
constructively together to get all the leaks resolved and the repair work done
as quickly as possible.  He agreed that he had not been required to attend all
of the appointments to test the leaks, but produced an email of January 26,
2018 in which he was thanked by the Landlord for his assistance and she said
she was glad he was there. 
16.   The
Tenant submits that there was an agreement with the Landlord that she would
waive the rent for October in light of the damaged condition of the rental unit
and the amount of time that repairs were taking.  The Tenant also claims
significant damages, including a significant rent abatement for the period of
disrepair, a per diem for meals, and lost income from his consulting business
for the time he took in attending at the rental unit for the testing of the
repairs.  The Tenant agreed he accepts the monetary jurisdiction of the Board
and that the maximum possible award is $25,000.00.
17.    The
Landlord called no evidence.
Analysis
18.   Section
82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) says that on an
application for arrears of rent, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any
issue that could be the subject of an application made by the Tenant under this
Act.
19.   Section
20 of the Act provides that a landlord is responsible for providing and
maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good
state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety,
housing and maintenance standards.
20.   However,
the leading case on the interpretation of section 20, Onyskiw v. CJM
Property Management Ltd, 2016 ONCA 477, has established that the mere fact
of disrepair should not necessarily result in a finding that a landlord has
failed to maintain a residential complex in a good state of repair pursuant to
section 20 of the Act, and that the context and circumstances should be
considered as well. The context and circumstances include the notification to
the Landlord of the disrepair and what response the Landlord made to the
disrepair.  If the response of the Landlord is reasonable, there will be no
breach of section 20.
21.   In
this case, the Tenant has agreed that the Landlord took all the necessary steps
and that he and the Landlord worked well together to try to have the earliest
resolution of the issue of water escape from the upper unit.  It is also
acknowledged by the Tenant that once the water escape had been resolved, the
Landlord promptly had the ceilings in the kitchen and bathroom repaired.  I
therefore find, on the Tenant’s own evidence, that there has been no breach of
the duty to repair pursuant to section 20.
22.   Section
22 of the Act provides that a landlord shall not substantially interfere with
the tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.   The reasonableness of
the landlord’s conduct is not relevant to the liability for interference with
reasonable enjoyment: the obligation is breached even if there is an
unavoidable state of disrepair while the landlord is effecting necessary
repairs.  This liability can be mitigated in prescribed circumstances described
in O. Reg. 516/06, section 8.  No steps pursuant to the regulation were taken
by the Landlord.
23.   On
the basis of the Tenant’s largely uncontested evidence, I find that his
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit was substantially interfered with by
the ongoing issue of water escapes from the upper unit and the damage caused to
the kitchen and bathroom ceilings from July 24, 2017 through to its resolution
and repairs to the damage by February 27, 2018.
24.   The
Tenant brought no evidence to support a reasonable fear of the ceilings caving
in, and there was no evidence presented that the ceilings were ever unstable or
falling down, so I am not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that the
kitchen and bathroom were unusable to the extent the Tenant treated them as
so.  The Tenant’s claim for an abatement of 50 – 100% of rent is not reasonable
in the circumstances.  Likewise, the necessity of the Tenant not using the
kitchen is not established, so the Tenant’s claims for all meals for the seven
month period will not be reimbursed as a reasonable out-of-pocket expense.
25.   The
Tenant’s claims for lost income for attending to the meetings concerning the
resolution of the water escape issues I also find have not been established on
the evidence – the Tenant brought no evidence of proof of income, or proof of
an hourly consulting rate – and are not established as a reasonable loss.  The
Tenant works from home, and while the Landlord found it helpful for him to be
there, the necessity of his attending each meeting was not established.  There
will be no award for lost income.
26.   I
have considered the circumstances and in particular that the aggravation
involved in the unit upstairs taking so long to adequately repair, while the
disrepair continued there was threat of further water escape, the ceilings in
the kitchen and bathroom were compromised and unsightly, and it took a number
of meetings within the Tenant’s unit to test the repairs.  I have also
considered the Landlord’s acknowledgement some sum (she suggested $2,000.00)
should be paid for the condition of the unit for a seven month period.  I
therefore find that the Tenant should receive a 15% abatement of the rent for
the period from July 24, 2018 to February 27, 2018 for substantial interference
with his reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.  (12.5% x $3600.00=$450.00
x12/365 =$14.79 x218 days=$3,224.22)  This amount will be set-off against the
arrears the Tenant owes.  
27.   The
Tenant also claims that there was an agreement that rent for October, 2017
would be waived by the Landlord as a result of the delay in repairs and the
inconvenience of the damage from the water escape.  There was no evidence of
specific agreement or denial of the proposal to waive the rent, but the
Landlord did not deposit the rent cheque in her possession for October, 2017
until she and the Tenant had a falling out in March, 2018 at which time she tried
to negotiate the cheque.  The Landlord also presented no contrary evidence on
this point so the Tenant’s claim of an agreement is unopposed.  I find, on a
balance of probabilities that there was an agreement to waive October 2017’s
rent and it was reasonable for the Tenant to rely on the agreement he thought
had been acknowledged and evidenced by the Landlord in not negotiating the
cheque for October.  The Tenant is entitled to a set-off of $3,600.00 from the
rent arrears. 
28.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until July 31,
2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act because the Tenant says
that he will need some extra time to void the order and there was no evidence
of hardship from the Landlord.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order HOL-02639-18 issued on May 4, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following order.
2.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before July 31, 2018.
3.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $9,154.28*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to July 13, 2018, less the rent deposit, and
less the set-off amounts in the total of $6,824.22.
4.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $118.36 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting July 14, 2018 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 31, 2018, then starting August 1,
2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after August 1, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before July 31, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $14,950.78** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after August 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
