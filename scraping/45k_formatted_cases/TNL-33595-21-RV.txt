Review Order
 
 
Hong Chen (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leonidas Liarakos and
Vassiliki Tsionis (VT) (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-33595-21 issued on October
25, 2021, amended October 26, 2021.
 
On October 26, 2021, the Tenants requested
a review of the order and
that the order be stayed until the request to review the
order is resolved.
 
On November 1, 2021 interim order TNL-33595-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on October 25, 2021, amended
October 26, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on January 14, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative R. Wei Yu and the Tenant VT attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants’ request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.




 
2.    
The hearing giving rise to the order under review was held on October 14, 2021. The Tenants did not attend.
3.    
This application had originally
been scheduled to be heard on October 21, 2021. The Landlord requested that the
hearing be expedited. That request was granted and the hearing was rescheduled to October 14, 2021. The Board sent out the notice of hearing
for the rescheduled hearing on September 7, 2021.
 
4.     At the review hearing VT testified that she emailed
the Board twice and also phoned the Board to advise that she could not attend
on October 14, 2021. The Board has no record of these emails, which
VT claims she sent on September 13, 2021 and October 14, 2021.
VT filed copies of what appear to be emails sent to the Board on these dates.
These emails state that the Tenants would like the matter scheduled back to
October 21, 2021 or some later date to give them time to prepare.
 
5.     VT testified that Board staff told her they would
contact the Landlord to say the Tenants would
not be able to attend
on October 14, 2021. VT testified that the online portal did not
indicate that a hearing would take place on October 14, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord and the Landlord’s legal representative both testified that they were not
contacted by the Board and told that the Tenant would not be able to attend.
 
7.     When the Board is told by a party that they cannot
attend a hearing on the scheduled date, staff do not then contact the opposing side and say the party cannot attend.
Board staff cannot reschedule a scheduled hearing
until directed to do so by a Board Member. There is no direction from a
Board Member rescheduling this matter.
 
8.     Because what VT said about the Board contacting the Landlord is so unusual,
and the Landlord denies that
it happened, I cannot find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Board told
VT that they would contact the Landlord.
 
9.     Based on the above, I find that the Tenants
had no good reason not to attend
the hearing on October 14,
2021 or send a representative. If VT needed more time to prepare at that point,
she could ask for an adjournment at the beginning of the hearing. Parties
cannot simply tell the Board they won’t attend, then not attend and expect to be
able to have the hearing on some later date. That would essentially give the
parties the ability to unilaterally reschedule Board hearings.
 
10.  Based on the above, I cannot find that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. Accordingly, the Tenants’ request
for a review is denied.
 
11.  I note that the Tenants are not at all prejudiced by
this decision. The Tenants signed a lease with a new landlord for a tenancy
commencing December 1, 2021 and are in the late stages of moving out of the
rental unit (when asked if she could have all of her belongings out of the unit in one week VT said yes without
hesitation). VT does not want the tenancy to continue. The order
under review terminates the tenancy. The Tenants would gain nothing by the
granting of this review in any event.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order TNL-33595-21 issued
on October 25, 2021, amended October 26, 2021 is denied. The
order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on November 1, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order TNL- 33595-21 is lifted.
