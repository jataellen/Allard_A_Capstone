2494899 Ontario Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard Benson
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent,
Pati Main-Hendershott, attended the hearing. As of 2:43 p.m., the Tenant was
not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased
to $1,189.10.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid all arrears for the period
ending February 28, 2022 after the application was
filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.




File Number: SOL-25467-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
