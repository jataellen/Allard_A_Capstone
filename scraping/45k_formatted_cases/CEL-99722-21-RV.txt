Review Order
 
Grey Bruce Property
Rentals Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Alex
Macauley (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-99722-21 issued on September 13, 2021. On
September 17, 2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard via video conference on December 20,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent, Andy Timmerman
(AT) the hearing.
At 1:32 p.m. the Tenant
was not present or represented
at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The issued
to be determined by the Board in the review
hearing is whether
the Landlord was not
reasonably able to participate at the hearing on July 26, 2021.
 
2.    
It was the evidence
of the Landlord’s agent, AT, that on July 26, 2021 the Landlord had 4
matters at the Board. He attended on behalf of the Landlord and was told by the
moderator that this file, along with another application, was not on the
docket. AT dealt with the other files on the docket.
 
3.    
It appears
from the Board’s
file, that the Landlord had matters in two different
hearing rooms, VC 81 and VC 82. It seems that the Landlord’s agent only
attended at VC82.
 
4.    
As I stated at the hearing,
this seems to have been a mistake
or a misunderstanding by
the Landlord about what matters were being heard in VC82.
 
5.    
I find it more likely than not, that the Landlord
intended to attend
the hearing on this
matter, but the Landlord’s agent was not in the correct hearing room.




 
6.    
The Landlord’s request for review
was granted and I heard
the Landlord’s application de novo (anew).
 
L1 – Arrears of Rent and Eviction:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 9,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the
rental unit on June 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent was $1,100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $1,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 5, 2020 to April 9, 2021.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s request to review
is granted.
 
2.    
Order CEL-99722-21 issued on September 13, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated as of June 30, 2021, the
date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,889.39*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
