Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55472-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2519 RIVARD AVENUE WINDSOR ON N8T2H4


 




Between:


Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and
 
Gloria Smith


 
 
Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Gloria
Smith (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative,
Cameron Parrott, attended the hearing. As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $222.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $666.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
($2,572.00), and costs
($186.00), is $2,758.00.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the




File Number: SWL-55472-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,758.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($2,572.00), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)   With respect of the monies owing under
paragraph 1 of this order, the Tenant shall pay $125.00
commencing February 21, 2022 and on the 21st day of each month thereafter until the amount
owing is paid in full.
 
(b)  
Commencing February 1, 2022, and until the amount
owing under paragraph
1 is paid, the Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for in full,
on or before the first business day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1
of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order
shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest at the
post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
