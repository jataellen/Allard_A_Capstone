Review Order
 
Old Oak Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rose Marie Laing (the ‘Tenant’) because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order SWL-53289-21 issued on October
25, 2021.
 
On November
19, 2021, and Tony Laing (the 'Potential Party')
requested a review
of the order. The request was heard by videoconference on February 2,
2022.
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative G. Kukor Lang attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing
the Landlord’s legal
representative consented to the Potential Party’s request for a review. The Landlord’s L1 application was
heard de novo (anew).

representative requested the consent of the Board
to withdraw this application. She advised that
although the Landlord believed that the Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed, she was not.

of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006, I consent
to the withdrawal of this application.
