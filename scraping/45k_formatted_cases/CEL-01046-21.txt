Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-01046-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      812, 4 HANOVER
ROAD
BRAMPTON ON L6S4J1
 




Between:                  Investors Group
Trust Co. Gwl Realty Advisors
Residential Inc.


Landlord




 
 
and
 




Donald James Cameron Jarred Alexander Cameron


Tenants




 
 
 
Investors Group Trust Co. Gwl
Realty Advisors Residential Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jarred
Alexander Cameron and Donald James
Cameron (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on September
20, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Martin Zarnett, and the Tenant, Donald
James Cameron, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 7, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,922.97 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to April 7, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord submitted that the Tenant
has not paid rent since
September 29, 2020.
The Tenant submitted that he made a payment of $18,429.97 through the
online portal on September 20, 2021. However, the Tenant could not provide
proof of the alleged
$18,429.97 payment. The Landlord
confirmed that it did not receive any payment from the Tenant on September 20, 2021 and
that payments made using the portal can be cancelled. The Landlord further
stated that payments
made through the portal typically take 3 to 4 days to reach the
Landlord.

5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I find it difficult to rely on the
statements made by the Tenant at the hearing regarding his alleged payment. The
Tenant was aware that the Landlord initiated an eviction proceeding against him
at the Board and yet he waited to the day of the hearing to make an alleged
payment of
$18,429.97 for which he has no proof. In the absence of evidence that
the payment was in fact made and received
by the Landlord, I am unable to apply
such a large payment to the outstanding rent arrears. I find
that the Tenant failed to pay the rent in full and have no reason to deny the
eviction requested by the landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $30,462.98*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 21, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. Any additional payment received
by the Landlord that is not
accounted for in this order should be applied to the outstanding arrears stated
in this order.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $60.00
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 22,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 4, 2022, then starting
March 5, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$33,050.61 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$34,878.19 if the payment
is made on or before
March 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.

9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection
on or after March 5, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
