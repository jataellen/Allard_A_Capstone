Israel Tshinkenke Badibanga


Tenant



 
Medallion Corporation (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Israel Tshinkenke Badibanga (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on February 24, 2021 with respect to application
TSL-15322-20. (L4 application)
 
This L4 application was sent by a Board
Duty Member to a hearing,
which was held by
videoconference on January 21, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Samuel M. Korman,
and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant consulted with Tenant
Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that for January
2022, the Tenant
did pay the $1,641.63 rent in
full but did so late, with a partial payment of $1,610.64 made on January 9,
2022 and the balance of $30.99 made on January 19, 2022. As well, the Tenant paid made a $469.01 arrears payment on January
19, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant testified as to his past and present employment circumstances, and indicated he filed a very recent
application with the Rent Bank. The
Tenant intended to show his current standing and preparedness to
negotiate/enter into a new payment plan to reconcile the rent arrears still
owing. The Tenant was cross-examined
particularly regarding his past part-time work when he took on various temporary
jobs for cash. At the end, the Landlord’s Legal Representative confirmed the Landlord is simply
seeking to secure the lawful
termination order (for breach) requested under the L4 application.
 
4.     Consequently, as of the filing
date for the L4 application on December 8, 2021, I find that the
Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the February 24, 2021 order:




 
•        
The Tenant did not pay the
Landlord the monthly rent for December 2021
on or before December 1, 2021 (but instead paid it in two payments
on December 15, 2021 and January 9, 2022); and
•        
The Tenant did not pay the $500.00 arrears
payment due on or before December 1, 2021 (which is still
outstanding).
 
5.    
As of the date of this L4 hearing, I find that the Tenant has also not met the following
conditions specified in the previous February 24, 2021 order:
 
•        
The Tenant did not pay the
Landlord the monthly rent for January 2022 on or before January 1, 2022,
but instead paid it in two payments
on January 9 and
19, 2022; and
•        
The Tenant did not pay the arrears payment
due on or before January
1, 2022, but instead paid
$469.01 arrears on January 19, 2022.
 
6.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
7.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$6,929.19 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TSL-15322-20. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $3,312.90 to January 31, 2022, and that amount is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order TSL-15322-20 is cancelled.
 
8.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,639.59 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
9.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2020
to January 26, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TSL-15322-20 issued
February 24, 2021 is cancelled
and is replaced with the following order.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,671.67*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 26, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$53.97 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.

The tenant has until February 5, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 5, 2022 the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 7, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
