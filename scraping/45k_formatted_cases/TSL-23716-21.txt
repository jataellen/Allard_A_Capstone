Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23716-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3609, 33 BAY STREET TORONTO ON M5J2Z3


 




Between:


Xiaowen Sun


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Ross Iliev


Tenant



 
 
 
Xiaowen Sun (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael Ross Iliev (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).
 
Xiaowen Sun (the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael Ross Iliev (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2
application).
 
 
This application was heard by video
conference on December 7, 2021.
 
At 3:30 pm, the Landlord and the Landlord’s Agent David Kolin attended the
hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2250.00.
 
N4 Notice, L1 Application
 
 
3.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with an N4 Notice to End Tenancy
for Non-payment of Rent (N4 Notice) on July 2, 2021. The date of termination is July 22, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord is seeking daily compensation and the application filing fee of $201.00.




File Number: TSL-23716-21
 
5.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 22, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,250.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August
5, 2020 to July 22, 2021.
 
8.     The Landlord indicated
she had made several attempts
to communicate with the Tenant by email, text and phone to discuss
the issue and a payment plan. The
Tenant did not respond.
 
N8 Notice, L2 Application
 
 
9.    
The Landlord’s L2/N8 application is made pursuant
to an N8 notice served
on the Tenant on July 23, 2021 with a termination date of September
30, 2021. The lease was month-
to-month at the time of service and rent was due on the 1st of every month.
 
10.  Based on the oral testimony of the Landlord and the
contents of the N8 notice, I find that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. As at the date of
the hearing, the Tenant has been late in paying rent 6 months in a row that
first became due starting November 1st, 2020.
 
11.  The pattern of late payments
is unmistakable and persistent.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
13. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
Regarding the L1 application:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $18,517.16*, which represents the amount
of rent owing and compensation
up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.




File Number: TSL-23716-21
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $73.97
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before February 20,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $22,200.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
Regarding the L2 application:
 
9.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated on February 20, 2022
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.
 
10.  If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
11. 
Upon receipt of this
order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
