Usborne &

the tenancy and evict
Penny Venton (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Cheryl Masson and a witness for the
Landlord, Jennifer Schroter, attended the hearing. While the Tenant had signed
into the hearing, she left prior to the commencement of the application being heard.
As of 11:29 a.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented. The matter
was heard uncontested.
 
Determinations:

to pay for the period from

of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 3,
2021.

The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 1, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the

$1,500.00.
 
4.

has made no payments since
the application was filed.

possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
