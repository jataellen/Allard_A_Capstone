In the matter

MISSISSAUGA ON L5G3B7



 
File Number:

Between:                  IMH Pool VI-A LP                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 
Kendra Peters                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
IMH Pool VI-A LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kendra Peters (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Matt Anderson, and the Tenant’s
representative, Peter Gardner,
attended the hearing. Roma
Seeram (‘RS’) attended the hearing as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     As a preliminary matter, the Tenant’s representative
contested the service of the Notice of Termination (N4) based on typographical errors in the Landlord’s Certificate of Service.
 
2.     RS testified that she personally served the N4 to the Tenant on September 13, 2021. This was uncontradicted by the Tenant.
Therefore, I am satisfied that the Tenant was properly served with the N4.
 
3.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a N4 notice effective October 2, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
5.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,947.00.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,967.42
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to October 2, 2021.
 
8.    
The Tenant paid $3,757.11
after the application was filed.
 
9.     The Tenant contests that she owes the filing fee. This
is because the Tenant was in constant communication with the Landlord
regarding her payments
and made good faith




File Number: CEL-03206-21
 
payments to the Landlord.
The Tenant’s representative argued that the Landlord filed this
application prematurely.
 
10.  I find the Landlord is entitled to its costs. At the time the application was filed, the Tenant was in arrears and the Landlord
was entitled to file this application. While the Tenant has
made good faith payments, those payments were not enough to cover the monthly
rent. The arrears have almost doubled
by the time the matter
was heard. The Landlord proved its claim and is entitled to its
cost of filing the application.
 
Section 83
 
11.  The Tenant’s representative advised the Board
that the Tenant
works in the restaurant
industry and her employment was affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Tenant
proposes the following:
 
a)     Commencing February 2022 and for a period of 12 consecutive months, ongoing rent
to be paid on the 10th and 25th of the
month; and
 
b)    
With regards to the arrears owing to January
31, 2022, the Tenant will pay
$133.00 per month for next 18 months.
 
12.  After considering the submissions of the parties, I
find it would be unfair to impose the Tenant’s payment plan. While I can
sympathize with the Tenant’s circumstance, the Tenant’s payment plan is not
concrete. The Tenant is unsure when she can start making the additional payments of $133.00
towards the arrears.
In addition, rent is due on the 1st
of the month in accordance with the tenancy agreement between the parties. In
my view, unless the parties agree, it is not the place of the Board to change
the terms of the tenancy.
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 17, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. This will allow the tenant additional time to pay the amount required to void this order
or make alternate arrangements.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 17, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,854.21*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
31, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$64.01 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.




File Number: CEL-03206-21
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 17,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or
before March 17, 2022, then starting March 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 18, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$4,923.89 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$8,817.89 if the payment
is made on or before
March 17, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
18, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
