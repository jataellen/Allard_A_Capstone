Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99217-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 490 PEMBROKE STREET E PEMBROKE
  ON K8A3L4


 




Between:


Stephanie Waito


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Breanna Carberry


Tenant



 
 
 
Stephanie Waito (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Breanna Carberry (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
December 14, 2021 with respect to application EAL-97309-21.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $784 rent on or
before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,089.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-97309-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,550.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-97309-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $775.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2017
to January 24, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-97309-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$872.87*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to January 24, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$25.78 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before February
4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 5, 2022.

The tenant has until February 3, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 3, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 5, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
