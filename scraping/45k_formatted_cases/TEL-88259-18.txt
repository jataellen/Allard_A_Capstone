M.H. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict K.K., S.M. and J.R. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 14, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s
representative, J.R., the second-named Tenant and the Tenant’s representative, N.P.,
attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 18, 2018.
2.     
The key dispute in the
matter before me is the amount of arrears. The Landlord says the outstanding
arrears for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $6,000.00. The Tenant says
there are no outstanding arrears because on January 6, 2018, he paid $9,000.00
to the Landlord for 6 month’s of rent in advance. The Tenant also says that he
paid $29,000.00 to the Landlord on January 6, 2018, as a loan to him. 
3.     
The Landlord says these
amounts were never paid to him. The Landlord says he did not meet with the
Tenant on January 6th, he was not paid $9,000.00 for 6 month’s of advanced
rent and he was not paid $29,000.00 for a loan. Essentially, the Landlord says
the Tenant is fabricating this entire story.
4.     
For the reasons that follow,
I find that the Tenant did not pay to the Landlord the money that he claims. 
The January 6th “Receipts”
5.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
provided the Board with copies of two receipts. One of the receipts is dated
January 6, 2018, and it says that the Tenant paid $9,000.00 to the Landlord for
the rent from January to June 2018. The second receipt is dated January 6,
2018, and says that the Tenant paid to the Landlord $29,000.00. The Tenant says
this last amount was a loan to the Landlord. The Tenant also provided to the
Board two earlier receipts from May and June 2017. The Landlord provided to the
Board seven receipts dating back to July 2017. 
6.     
The difficulty with the
Tenant’s first two receipts is the handwriting, signature and format are
completely different from the other receipts that he submitted as well as the
receipts the Landlord submitted. All of the other receipts, both from the
Tenant and the Landlord, are in the Landlord’s own handwriting but the two
January 6th receipts are not. The Tenant says that this happened
because he personally filled out the January 6th receipts and the
Landlord simply agreed to sign them. I find this explanation to be implausible.

7.     
The signatures on the
January 6th receipts do not match any of the earlier receipts that
the Tenant and the Landlord submitted. Also, the Landlord says he carefully
tracks the serial numbers on all his receipts and even creates serial numbers
when the receipt does not have one. This practice is clearly identifiable on all
of the receipts submitted by both the Tenant and the Landlord. However, the
January 6th receipts do not contain serial numbers and do not have
serial numbers added by the Landlord. While this detail may seem insignificant
in itself, I find it compelling that these numbers are missing on two cheques
that total almost $40,000.00. It would not be in the Landlord’s interest for
him to sign two cheques for such large amounts and then have no way to track
the serial numbers for those receipts.  
The January 6th “Meeting”
8.     
The second problematic
aspect of the Tenant’s version of events is his allegation that he met with the
Landlord on January 6, 2018, and paid him the two large amounts described
above. While it is true that the two receipts are dated January 6, 2018, I am
not persuaded that the parties actually met on that date or that the Tenant
paid the Landlord any money on that date. 
9.     
At the hearing, the Landlord
provided the Board with extensive documentation including numerous copies of
text messages between him and the Tenant. On page 22 of the package of text
messages, the Landlord texts the Tenant on January 5th saying “today
is Friday I will come cash pleas let me the time”(sic). The Tenant then
responds on that same day saying “you left me a letter and I send you msg for
next Friday not this Friday for cash”. The Landlord then responds “pls remember
next Friday”. This exchange supports the Landlord’s testimony that he did not
meet with the Tenant on January 6th and did not receive any money on
that day. In fact, the Landlord wanted to meet with the Tenant on January 5th,
but the Tenant insisted that they meet the following Friday which was January
12th. These text messages blatantly contradict the Tenant’s version
of events as well as the dates on the alleged receipts that he provided to the
Board. 
The Text Messages
10.  
The third problem with the
Tenant’s version of events is that his testimony is contradicted by the
numerous other text messages the Landlord provided at the hearing. The Tenant
says that he paid 6 months of rent in advance and paid $29,000.00 simply to
help out the Landlord because they are from the same country. 
11.  
However, the text messages
between the Tenant and the Landlord show the Landlord constantly chasing the
Tenant to pay his rent. The messages show the Tenant repeatedly given the
Landlord excused like he is having “technical issues” at his bank, his accounts
are “on review from the government”, he will pay the rent if the Landlord will
“please give me next week” , or that he will send the rent “in two parts”. 
12.  
Not only are these not the
words of a person who has almost $40,000.00 at his disposal to pay his rent
early or give a large loan, but the two large sums of money are never actually
mentioned in any of the text messages. Neither party asks for or offers to pay
rent in advance or make a loan of $29,000.00, neither party makes arrangements
to meet and exchange these two sums of money and neither party acknowledges
that the money has been exchanged after the alleged January 6th
meeting. The Landlord does not request these large sums of cash, and he does
not thank the Tenant for them. The Tenant does not offer these large sums of
cash, and does not even mention the money even when the Landlord continues to
chase him for rent money numerous times throughout January 2018 and February. 
13.  
If what the Tenant says is
true and he paid 6 months of rent in advance and loaned the Landlord a
substantial sum of money, I find it implausible that these exchanges would
never be mentioned or referred to in the countless text message conversations
between these parties. I find this particularly concerning since the Tenant was
served with the notice of termination on January 4, 2018, and yet there is no
evidence that the Tenant mentions the large sums of money to the Landlord even
when he is facing eviction for arrears of rent.  
The January 15th Receipt
14.  
The final problem with the
Tenant’s version of events rests in one additional receipt that the Landlord
provided to the Board. There is no dispute that the Tenant paid to the Landlord
$2,000.00 on January 15, 2018, for arrears of rent dating back to November and
December of the previous year. This amount appears on the Landlord’s
application, the receipt is dated January 15th and contains a
description of the arrears from November and December.  
15.  
I find it implausible that
the Tenant paid to the Landlord $38,000.00 just 9 days earlier, but decided not
to use that money to pay the outstanding arrears and instead decided to pay 6
months of rent in advance and give the Landlord a loan. This series of events
simply makes no sense. 
16.   On any application before the Board the person who alleges any
particular incident or event occurred has the burden of leading sufficient
evidence to establish that it is more likely than not that their version of
events is true. In this case that burden falls on the Tenant. Based on the evidence
before me, I find that the Tenant has led insufficient evidence to establish
that he paid to the Landlord $9,000.00 for 6 months of rent in advance or that
he paid to the Landlord a loan of $29,000.00. The receipts are not consistent
with the Landlord’s record keeping practices, the text messages contradict the
Tenant’s testimony and the legitimate January 15th receipt does not
corroborate the Tenant’s version of events. 
17.  
As I am not satisfied that the Tenant paid to
the Landlord $9,000.00, I am satisfied that the outstanding arrears are as the
Landlord describes them. The
outstanding arrears owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $6,000.00. 
18.  
The only remaining issue
before me is whether it would be unfair in all the circumstances to grant relief
from eviction.
19.  
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
20.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
21.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 3, 2017 to January 18, 2018,
in the amount of $17.02.
22.     
The Tenant’s circumstances
are that he has lived in the rental unit since 2017 along with his wife and 4
year old child. The Tenant says his child has a medical condition that makes it
difficult for him to breathe. 
23.     
For the reasons already
stated, I find that the Tenant has provided false testimony to the Board and
submitted two fake receipts. Granting relief from eviction is discretionary and
I must take the Tenant’s testimony into account when considering whether to
grant any such relief. As the Tenant has provided false testimony to the Board
and submitted fake documents, he has disentitled himself to relief because he
has come before the Board with unclean hands. 
24.      Given all of the above, and given the fact that
this matter was previously adjourned at the Tenant’s request on March 7, 2018, which has added a lengthy delay to this process, I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
25.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
26.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 4,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $3,059.47*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $36.99 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 4, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 5,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 4, 2018, then starting June 5, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 5, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $6,190.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $7,690.00 if the payment is made on or before June 4, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 5, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
