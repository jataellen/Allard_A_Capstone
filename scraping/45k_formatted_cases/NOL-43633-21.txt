In the matter
of:


B2, 630 DOUGLAS STREET NORTH BAY ON P1B5N8


 




Between:


North Bay Property Rental


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brenda Chum
  Pat Chum


Tenants



 
 
 
North Bay Property Rental
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Pat Chum and Brenda Chum (the 'Tenants')
because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by video conference on
November 22, 2021. At 12:19 pm, Julie Stillar (JS) the Landlord’s Agent
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.    The rental unit is a 3-bedroom apartment in a multi-unit building.
 
2.    The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
First and Second
N5 Notices
 
3.    The Tenants were served an N5 notice of termination,
pursuant to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), on April 4, 2021. That section provides that a landlord may serve notice of termination on a tenant
“if the conduct of the tenant… is such that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord
or another tenant
or substantially interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant”.
 
4.   
The N5 Notice alleged that on multiple occasions were intoxicated on the grounds
of the rental complex
and the services of Police
were required. On March 25, 2021 and March




 
31, 2021, the Tenants left drug
paraphernalia around the unit and rental complex. The Landlord also alleged
that from March 23, 2021 o March 25, 2021, the Tenants put their garbage
outside the rental unit in a manner
that interferes with other
tenants’ access to the
laneway.
 
5.   
Pursuant to
subsection 64(3) of the Act the Tenant was given seven days to stop the
behaviour complained of. Section 64(3) says: “The notice of termination under subsection
(1) is void if the tenant,
within seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct
or activity or corrects the omission.”
6.   
It was the testimony
of JS that the Tenants
did not stop the behaviour
that gave rise the
first N5 notice.
 
7.   
Pursuant to section 68(1) of the
Act, the Landlord served the Tenants with a second N5 Notice on August 3, 2021. The Landlord’s application is based on the second
N5 Notice. Accordingly, the Landlord need not prove the truthfulness of the allegations in the first N5
Notice, only that it meets the statutory requirements contained in section 64
of the Act. I am satisfied that it
does.
 
8.    I acknowledge it would be prejudicial to a tenant
if the allegations in a first N5 Notice were without any foundation and made
simply for the purpose of allowing a landlord to serve a second, non-voidable
notice pursuant to section 68(1). I
am satisfied that is not the case in
the matter before me.
 
9.   
In the second N5 Notice, the
Landlord provided details regarding incidents
that occurred on July 14, 2021, July 17, 2021 and July 24, 2021. The
allegations were concerning the garbage, yelling and public drunkenness, broken glass and loud parties
and disruption to other tenants.
 
10. The L2 application was filed on August 18, 2021 and the Landlord
seeks damages in the
amount of $$3500.00 alleging that the Tenants caused damage to drywall in the
unit, repainting, entrance door, smoke damage and damage to flooring caused by
a dog.
 
11.
On the date of
the hearing JS did not provide any evidence to support the allegation of damages caused by the Tenants.
 
12. JS did not provide any substantive testimony about the damages,
did not provide photos nor
receipts to support any of the claims made against the Tenants.
 
13.
Absent some
further or other evidence, I am not prepared to make a finding that the Tenants caused
damage within the rental unit that supports
the Landlord’s application.
 
14. On the date of the hearing, JS testified that the Landlord
would be willing
to work with the
Tenants to preserve the tenancy and supported the suggestion of a conditional
order identifying the issues that gave rise to the notice of termination and an
order will issue accordingly.
 
15.
The order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    For a period of 12 months from the date of this Order,
the Tenants shall manage the garbage in the manner prescribed by the Landlord. The Tenants shall not engage in excessive noise and
disruption of other tenants nor repeat any of the behaviours specified in the N5 notice of termination.
 
2.    If the Tenants
breaches the terms in this agreement related
to the issues in the application,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006, without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no later than
30 days after the Tenant’s breach.
