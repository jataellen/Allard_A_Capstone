Tenant



 
 
 
DD Acquistions Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kostantine Pagonis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
19, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew, attended the hearing. As of 10:48 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
September 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,654.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,654.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
September 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $519.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 30, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
