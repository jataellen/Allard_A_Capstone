In the
  matter of:


710, 547 BELMONT AVENUE W KITCHENER
  ON N2M5G9


 




Between:


Galaxy Real
Estate Core Ontario Prop


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Polinsky


Tenant



 
 
 
Galaxy Real Estate Core Ontario
Prop (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daniel
Polinsky (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Rawan Hussein, attended the hearing. As of 3:27 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective January 9, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,298.40.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,283.02 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 9, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $4,260.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the




File Number: SWL-55384-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022, pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $161.60*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$42.69 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 22, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit, and
$186.00 for
the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       
$1,710.64 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)       $3,009.04 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
