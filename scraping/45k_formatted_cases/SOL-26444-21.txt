AVENUE
GUELPH ON
N1H6Z8

and
 
Brittany Poor                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
On November
12, 2021, The Corporation Of The County
Of Wellington (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brittany Poor (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 26, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-23217-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant had agreed to immediately stop the actions
and activities detailed in the Form N5 notices and was to ensure those actions and activities did not occur for the next 24 months from October
13, 2021 to October 12, 2023. This included no excessive noise such as
door slamming, arguing,
banging, yelling, screaming and no abusive language directed
at other people in the complex.
 
On October 22, 2021 at 10:30 am, it is alleged that
the Tenant was creating excessive noise in the rental
unit including banging,
jumping up and down and screaming.
 
On October 25, 2021 at 3:30 am and 10:30 am, it is
alleged that the Tenant was creating excessive noise
in the rental unit including arguing with a man, yelling, screaming, jumping up and down
repeatedly, and throwing heavy items.
 
On October 26, 2021 at 12:40 am, it is alleged that
the Tenant was creating excessive noise in the rental
unit and the adjacent
common hallway including heavy stomping, yelling and
throwing of items. Police were
called.
 
On November 1, 2021 from approximately 4:00 am to 7:30 am, it is alleged that the
Tenant was creating excessive noise in the common hallway of the residential




 
complex including yelling,
screaming, arguing, banging
on walls and slamming
doors.
 
On November 1, 2021 from approximately 6:15 am, it is
alleged that the Tenant tried to force her way into another
tenant’s rental unit. It is further alleged
that the Tenant called this
other tenant a “pig” and a “thief”.
 
3.    
The Landlord
was to waive $186.00 for and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-23217-21
should the Tenant comply with the conditions agreed upon. The Landlord is now
requesting for the costs to be awarded since the Tenant did not meet the
conditions specified in the order. As a result, the previous order SOL-23217-21
is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order SOL-23217-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.     
The Tenant
shall pay to the
Landlord $186.00. This amount represents the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $3.98
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
