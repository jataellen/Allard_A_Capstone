In the matter
of:


40 CRAIGMORE CRESCENT NORTH YORK ON M2N2Y6


 




Between:


Bai Sun
Feng Qiang Sun


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Allen
Bargman Bessie Mintz Ida Bargman


Tenants



 
 
Bai Sun and Feng
Qiang Sun (the 'Landlords') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ida Bargman, Bessie
Mintz and Allen
Bargman (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe. The Landlords also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on November 19, 2021 at 9:00am.
The Landlords and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
ADJOURNMENT REQUESTS
 
1.   
At the hearing on February 8, 2021, the Tenants sought
and adjournment on the basis that
they did not see the attachment and did not receive the application. The
Tenants testified that they had receipts needed time to gather them.
The Tenants further indicated that they did not recall receiving the N4 notice
of termination but later indicated that they may have gotten it.
 
2.   
The Landlord
testified that disclosure was sent to the Tenant in advance
of the hearing; the Landlord
believed this was a delay tactic on the Tenants’ part and opposed the Tenants’
adjournment request as the arrears stood over $25,000.00. The Landlord
presented a text message from the Tenant where the Tenant confirms received of
the N4, the notice of hearing and
states in part “I have your rent and I am
not going to transfer it to you until you have cancelled the
meeting taking place on the 8th.”
3.    The Board’s records show the notice
of hearing was mailed to the parties
on January 21, 2021.




 
4.    Based on the evidence
before the Board, I denied the Tenants’ adjournment request as I was not
satisfied that the Tenant was unaware of the hearing date, did not receive the
N4 notice of termination or the application. In fact, the text message
presented directly contradicts the Tenants’ testimony which seriously
undermines the Tenants’ credibility. I find that the Tenants were aware of the
hearing date, the application and had sufficient opportunity to gather their evidence but they failed
to do so. I proceeded to hear the parties evidence on the merits of the
application.
 
5.    At the hearing on November 19, 2021, the Tenants, once again, sought
an adjournment as they required time to gather their
receipts in support of their assertion that they had a last month’s rent
deposit.
 
6.    The Landlord opposed this
request as the arrears were still significant high; further, the interim order indicated what the hearing
was going to focus on and the Tenants had since
February 2021 to gather this evidence.
 
7.    The Board’s records show
the notice of hearing was served to the
parties on October 22, 2021. Further, an interim order was issued by the Board on February
22, 2021 instructing the parties to be prepared to
deal with the specific issue of the status of the last month's rent deposit.
 
8.    Based on the evidence
before the Board, I denied the Tenants’ adjournment request as I found that the Tenants
had sufficient opportunity to gather their
evidence on this issue but they failed to do so. I proceeded to
hear the parties submissions on the last month's rent deposit.
 
L1 APPLICATION
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to November 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 19, 2020.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$2,800.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $33,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlords
incurred charges of $20.00 for administration charges related to cheques
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenants, which were returned NSF.
 
6.    
The Landlords
are not holding
a last month rent deposit
and seek an amendment to the
application to reflect this.
 
7.    
The arrears
and costs owing to November
30, 2021 total $29,706.00.




 
8.    
The Landlord
seeks a standard voidable order with expedited
eviction as the quantum of arrears has caused a huge financial
distress on the Landlord since she has been using her home line of credit and
getting personal loans to ensure mortgage on the rental property is paid on
time.
 
Tenants’ Evidence
 
9.    
The Tenants dispute the
arrears as claimed by the Landlord and testified the rent has been paid for the
period June 2020 to December 2020. The Tenants do not recall whether the rent
for January 2020 to May 2020 was paid. They agree they owe the Landlord money but not the amount
being claimed by the Landlord.
No further evidence was submitted in support of this assertion such as bank statements or receipts showing proof of payment.
 
10. 
They testified that they were awaiting funds from a motor vehicle
accident settlement that has been ongoing
for 6 years and for which a hearing is scheduled to take place
in March 2021 at which point
they would have additional funds to put towards the arrears.
 
11.  The Tenants seek to preserve
their tenancy and propose a repayment plan whereby they would pay the rent for February on
February 9, 2021 and $5,600.00 on March 31, 2021. No further payments were
proposed to pay the balance of the arrears.
 
12.  In the alternative, the Tenants seek a
delay in eviction to April 30, 2022 as they will be moving to a retirement home. The Tenants
are currently on fixed income and their motor
vehicle accident case has not yet resolved, which is why they are in rent
arrears.
 
13.  The Tenants also dispute that they moved into the rental unit in August
2019 and believe their tenancy began on August 1, 2017 which was a fixed term
lease for two years with an option to extend for a third year. The Tenants did
not have their original lease agreement at the hearing, so I permitted them to
make a post hearing submission for the lease
only on or before November
22, 2021. I note that the Tenants
failed to file the lease agreement with the Board as
permitted.
 
14.  On cross-examination, the Tenants confirmed
that they did not have any proof of payment for rent for 2017. Further, the
lease agreement submitted by the Landlord had their initials and their names
were printed; however, the writing on the lease agreement was not theirs. The Tenants further
confirmed that the payments reflected
on the update sheet were correct; that the rent was always $2,800.00;
and that they had no evidence that they would move out in April 2022.
 
15.  The Tenants further dispute that there is
no last month's rent deposit. The Tenants testified that when they moved into the rental
unit on August 1, 2017, they provided
the Landlord with a first and last month’s rent via cheque. They had to
borrow money from their brother in Florida to be able to do so.
 
16.  The second-named Tenant
testified that she was not aware if the deposit
had been paid because she was sick in the hospital
at the time; she recalls they moved into the unit in the spring and that it was
a few years ago.




 
17.  The third-named Tenant testified that she
recalls moving into the unit 2-3 years ago but could not recall whether the
rent was $1,800.00 or $1,700.00. She recalls giving the Landlord $1,800.00 in
first and last month’s rent; she also recalls the lease agreement was signed
by herself, her sister, her son and her granddaughter and that they got money from the bank to do so as well as
her other son in Florida.
 
ANALYSIS
 
18.  With respect to the quantum of rent
arrears, I find, the arrears and costs owing to November 30, 2021 to be aligned with the Landlord’s evidence of
$29,706.00. I say this based on the Tenant’s own evidence that the rent for
June 2020 – December 2020 was paid,
which I find is reflected in the payments totalling $19,600.00. I also say this
based on the Tenants’ evidence that the rent for January
2020 – May 2020 may not have been
paid.
 
19.  I also say this based
on the text message conversation presented by the Landlord at the
hearing on February 8, 2021 wherein the Landlord
states “according my calculation, you owing rent in the amount of $26,306”
and the Tenants’ response to that was “No I wont be able to pay you the $26306
as of now, my accident court case is being heard in March.” At no point is the
quantum of arrears contested by the Tenants, but for at the hearing.
 
20.  Finally, I say this as the Tenants failed
to support their assertion of owing less than what was claimed by the Landlord
by presenting bank statements, withdrawals, e-transfers, etc. of these payments
whereas the Landlord
submitted the full payment history
since the beginning of this
tenancy.
 
21.  Without positive evidence,
it is very difficult to establish a negative claim.
Thus, in order for the Tenants’ claim to be
successful, they must provide some positive proof of the disputed payment, which,
I find, they did not.
 
22.  At paragraph 26 of F. H. v. McDougall,
2008 SCC 53 (CanLII), the Court found that the civil standard of proof
requires that evidence “must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”
Here I find the Tenants
have failed to meet the required standard.
 
23.  With respect to the issue of when the
tenancy began, as I did not receive a lease agreement from the Tenants by
November 22, 2021 and no submissions from the Landlord in response to the
Tenants’ submission by November 24, 2021, the lease agreement submitted by the
Landlord shows the tenants as the three named on the application and Allen’s
daughter – consistent with IB’s
testimony. The term of the lease was on year between August 2019 and July 2020.
The rent is listed as $2,800.00 and under the deposit section it stipulates that there was none being held. The pages of the lease were initialed by all three Tenants and the first-named Landlord. Furthermore, the lease appears to be signed by the
Tenants on August 23, 2019.
 
24.  Based on the evidence before the Board, I
find that the best evidence before me is that of the Landlord’s which indicated this lease began on August
1, 2019. This is consistent with




 
the period of rent arrears claimed
on the N4 notice of termination and the payment
history presented by the Landlord and the lease agreement.
 
25.  I also find that the Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit as clearly stipulated
on the lease agreement and initialed and signed by the Tenants. I also say this
as the Tenants failed to produce receipts showing payments towards the deposit.
 
26. 
With respect
to the Tenants’ request for relief, I do not find it fair under
the circumstances to award
the repayment plan as requested by the Tenant. I say this for the following
reasons: first, it is unclear what caused the Tenants to be in arrears of rent
– on the one hand the Tenants stated it was due to their motor vehicle settlement
which has been pending for six years but this occurred prior to their move into
the rental unit; and finally, the quantum of arrears outstanding as of the
hearing date are significantly large. Absent any other evidence it appears that
the Tenants are unwilling to pay the rent to the Landlord.
 
27. 
Therefore,
I cannot grant the Tenants’ request for a payment plan. I can however consider
whether to postpone the eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I
find the Tenants’ request to delay eviction to April 2022 to be excessive given
the quantum of arrears
outstanding that are beyond the Board’s jurisdiction as of the date of this order.
 
28. 
Given
the Tenant’s personal circumstances, I find that some delay in eviction is
warranted; however, given
that the hearing
was a month ago, I find that a further
delay to January 31, 2022 to be appropriate.
 
29. 
Finally, with respect to the Landlord’s request for expedited
eviction, Paragraph 74(3)(b) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') states:
 
An order of the Board terminating a tenancy and evicting the tenant
in an application under section
69 based on a notice
of termination under section 59 shall,
 
…
 
(b) inform the tenant and the landlord that the order will become
void if, before the order becomes enforceable, the tenant pays to the landlord
or to the Board the amount required
under subsection (4) and specify
that amount;
 
30.  This
means the Board
is mandatorily required
to provide the Tenant with another
opportunity to avoid eviction by paying the Landlord the arrears of rent and costs
outstanding.
 
31. 
Orders are mailed to all parties.
Pursuant to subsection 191(3) documents that are mailed are deemed to be received five
days after mailing.




 
32. 
So if the Board issues an order saying the Tenant has less than the standard eleven days
the Board usually allows, the maximum time period the Tenant will have to void
is less than the standard six days if the mail arrives on time.
 
33. 
What
this means is that the Landlord’s request for an expedited order runs a very
high risk of the Tenant being effectively deprived of the right to void that
the Board is mandatorily required to give under the Act. Although the Board
certainly has the discretion to do as the Landlord requests
it seems to me that doing so in the absence
of very exceptional circumstances and expedited service
on the Tenant, would be contrary
to the spirit of the Act.
 
34.  As
a result, while I am mindful
of the Landlord’s concern with respect to the
quantum of rent arrears,
I am not prepared to exercise my discretion and shorten the voiding period from the standard eleven days to
anything less as sought by the Landlord.
 
35.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31,
2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
36.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $33,322.49 (less any amount
paid by the Tenants
to the Landlord after the application was filed with the Board)*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 10, 2022 and
the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlords by or on
behalf of the Tenants, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $92.05
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.




 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
Pursuant to subsection
207(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) the Board may not
order payment of an amount more than the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims
Court, which is $35,000.00.
I do not believe this applies to the amount
to be paid if the Tenants wish
to void the order, as this is an optional payment.
 
9.    
As such, if, on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount
of
$35,306.00** to the
Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
10.  The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
