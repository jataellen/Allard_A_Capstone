Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21424-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 97 WILKINS
STREET TRENTON ON K8V3N3


 




Between:


2477061 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brittney Lyn McGinnis Shelby Glenna Hammond


Tenants



 
 
 
2477061 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brittney Lyn McGinnis and Shelby Glenna Hammond (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on November 3, 2021 with respect to application TEL-17722-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenants were to have paid the lawful
rent in full plus $300.00 in arrears on or before February 1, 2022. The Tenants paid a total of $1,200.00 on
or before February 1, 2022, of which $1,189.10 was applied to the full lawful
rent, and the remainder to the required payment
of arrears. The Tenants therefore did not pay
$300.00 arrears in full on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $4,886.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TEL-17722-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $3,275.10 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-17722-21 is cancelled.




 
5.    
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,189.10 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 22, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-17722-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,771.06*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 22, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$39.09 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
