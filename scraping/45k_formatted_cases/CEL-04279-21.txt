Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04279-21
 
In the matter of:      31 TANASI RD
BRAMPTON ON L6X0K5
 




Between:                  Dhanya Dave Manisha Dave


Landlords




 
and
 




Antoinette Boyce Elijah McCallum Shea Boyce


Tenants




 
On November 25, 2021, Dhanya Dave and Manisha
Dave (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shea
Boyce, Elijah McCallum and Antoinette Boyce (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet
a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 4, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-00132-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$500.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. This was a breach of the prior consent order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction,
the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$10,975.00 for rent arrears in Order CEL-00132-21. The amount that is
still owing from that order
is $9,975.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-00132-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have also failed to
pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.       
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order CEL-00132-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $9,973.66*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$78.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing*
on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
