Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: CEL-66033-17










 
 

DW
and SW (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict RM and MC (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
The
Landlords also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent (L2
Application). 
 
This
application was heard in Mississauga on April 12, 2017 and May 11, 2017.
 
The Tenants and the Tenants Legal Representative, PR attended the
hearing.

The Landlords and the Landlords Legal Representative, SS attended the hearing. 
 
Preliminary Matters: 
 
1.   
This matter was heard with CET-65230-17.
Separate orders will be issued. 
Determinations:
 
            Lawful Rent
 
1.     
The Tenants dispute their lawful rent and the
arrears claimed by the Landlord because they aid that they should be paying
only $1,500.00 a month.
2.     
The Tenants testified that there was a verbal
agreement with the Landlords to reduce the rent from $1,850.00 to $1,500.00 if
the Tenant’s nephew moved out of the rental unit in February 2017. 
3.     
The Landlords dispute that there was an
agreement to reduce the rent from $1,850.00. 
4.     
The Tenant’s nephew (AM) was deemed an occupant
of the household in order CET-65230-17. 
5.     
There was insufficient evidence to establish
that the parties had a verbal agreement to reduce the rent based on the number
of people occupying the home. Therefore, I find that the lawful rent is
$1,850.00 and the Tenants owe the arrears as claimed by the Landlords.
6.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
April 6, 2017. The arrears outstanding up-to May 31, 2017 are $4,111.40, plus
the $190.00 application filing fee, which totals $4,301.40. 
7.     
The Tenants said that the rent was not due on
the fixed date every month. This was disputed by the Landlords who said that it
was due on the first of the month. 
8.     
I find that the rent is more likely than not due
on the first of the month, particularly since the tenancy commenced on May 1,
2016. I do not find there was an agreement between the parties to pay on any
date during the month. 
9.     
I find that the Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due every month since the June 2016. A copy
of the Landlord’s ledger was submitted (Landlord Exhibit #1). 
10.   The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
11.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period
from May 1, 2016 to April 6, 2017.
12.   The Tenants proposed a payment plan in order to secure their
tenancy. The Tenants proposed an additional $600.00 a month until the arrears
are paid. In the alternative, the Tenants requested three months to move
because their children attend school in the neighbourhood. The Tenants said
that one of their children was accepted into a French immersion program nearby.

13.   The Landlords opposed a payment plan because the Tenants have only
made minimal payments towards the rent and due to the amount of arrears
outstanding. The Landlords reside next door and said that the relationship
between the parties has also deteriorated significantly. The Landlords are
seeking to terminate the tenancy for May 31, 2017. 
14.   I am denying the Tenants request for a payment plan because of their
failure to pay rent on time for the past twelve months, the failure to pay the
rent in full every month, the significant amount of arrears outstanding, there
have been no good faith payments made to the Landlords even though both Tenants
are fully employed and because the current relationship between the parties is
strained. 
15.   However, I am granting the Tenants an extension to June 30, 2017 to
allow the Tenants additional time to find alternate accommodations in the
neighborhood and for their children to finish the school year. The financial
prejudice to the Landlords is minimized given that there is a last month’s rent
deposit. 
16.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
June 30, 2017 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the Landlords and the
Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before June 30, 2017.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords
$2,123.87*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
May 29, 2017, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 30, 2017
to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before June 9, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 10, 2017 at 2.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before June 30,
2017, then starting July 1, 2017, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlords, on or after July 1, 2017.
