Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-11574-17
 











 
 

CH and JCR (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict LF (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises and
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date. The Landlords have also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the damage.
 
This application was heard in London on
January 30, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, TS, attended the
hearing.  As of 10:40 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2017
to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective December 15, 2017.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent is $1,350.00.
4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
5.      The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. 
L2 Application:
                        N5 Notice
6.     
The Landlord served a first
N5 Notice to End Your Tenancy for Interfering with Others, Damages or
Overcrowding (N5) on November 28, 2017 because the Tenant allegedly broke a
window in the rental unit.  The Tenant did not void the N5 Notice by repairing
the window or paying the Landlord $485.00 to fix the window.  Because the
Tenant did not void the first N5 Notice during the voiding period, the Landlord
can proceed with the L2 application based on the first N5 Notice.
 
7.     
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative testified the Landlord viewed the rental unit in late October 2017
and found a window to be broken.  The windows in the rental unit were in good
repair and not broken when the Tenant moved into the property.  The Landlord
believes the broken window was caused by either the negligence of the Tenant or
the Tenant wilfully caused the damage. 
8.     
The Landlord issued a first
N5 Notice and the Tenant failed to either fix the window or pay for the
repair.  The Landlord provided a copy of a quote to repair the window and is
seeking the cost in the amount of $485.00 for the repair.
9.     
Based on the uncontested
evidence before me I find the Tenant has negligently or willfully caused undue
damage to the rental unit by breaking the window.  I find the cost of $485.00
to repair the window reasonable in the circumstances.  
          N8
Notice
 
10.   The Landlord also served a N8 Notice for
persistently late rent with a termination date of April 30, 2018.  
11.   The Tenant is on a month to month tenancy.
12.   The Tenant has been significantly late 7 times
in 10 months.
13.   The Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy
because the Tenant has persistently paid the rent late.
14.   Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I
find the Tenant has been persistently late paying rent   
15.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').  The Tenant was not at the hearing to make
any submissions about the preservation of the tenancy and, in the absence of
these submissions, I find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Because the N8 Notice sets out a
termination date of April 30, 2018 and there would be no prejudice to either
the Tenant or the Landlord should the Tenant paid the arears and damages by
February 13, 2018 in order to stay until the termination date on the N8 Notice.
Therefore, if the Tenant pays the outstanding arrears and damages, the
termination will be postponed to April 30, 2018.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant complies
with paragraph 9 of this Order, the tenancy between the Landlords and the
Tenant is terminated February 13, 2018.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 13, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $5,490.37*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 2, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $485.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the
damage and or replacing the damaged property on or before February 13, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 3, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 13, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 14, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 13, 2018, then starting February 14, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 14, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before February
13, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $7,565.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for will be delayed until April 30, 2017. 
10.   If the Tenant complies with and paragraph 9 of
this order then:
11.   The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated on April 30, 2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
April 30, 2018.
12.   If the Tenant does not move out of the rental
unit on or before April 30, 2018 he shall pay to the Landlord $44.38 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting May 1, 2018 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
13.   If the unit is not vacated on or before April
30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
14.   Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
15.   The Tenant has no right to void this part of the
Order under subsection 74(4) of the Act.
