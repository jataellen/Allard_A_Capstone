Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006











 

CF (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict CM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.  (L1 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date. (L2 Application)
 
These applications were heard in Barrie on September
21, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, IS, attended the
hearing.  AM signed in as a witness for the Landlord but did not testify.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 16, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to August 16, 2018.
 
L2 Application
4.     
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a Notice to End Your Tenancy for Interfering With Others, Damage
of Overcrowding (the ‘N5 notice’) on August 1, 2018, which clearly set out
the Landlord’s claims relating to the Tenant not paying their share of the
utility bills, the Tenant’s unauthorized parking of their car, the Tenant
causing undue noise and the Tenant’s failure to properly dispose of garbage.  The
Landlord is seeking the non-remedial (non-voidable) termination of the tenancy
in this L2 application.
5.     
IL submitted the following
exhibits in support of the Landlord’s L2 claims:  
 
•       
Exhibit LL#1 – copy of
signed to lease to establish the Tenant’s requirement to pay 60% of the utility
bills for the building that contains the rental unit;
•       
Exhibit LL#2 – list of all
outstanding gas, water and hot water tank bills not paid by the Tenant up to
September 2018;
•       
Exhibit LL#3 – copy of the
Landlord’s July 16, 2018 letter of notice to the Tenant, advising the Tenant of
the unpaid utility bills from February to June 2018;
•       
Exhibit LL#4 – photographs
of the Tenant’s blue Hyundai vehicle parked incorrectly in the other building
tenant’s spot on the driveway on July 24, 2018, August 2, 2018 and August 28,
2018;
•       
Exhibit LL#5 – copies of the
Landlord’s July 12, 2018 letter of notice to the Tenant, advising the Tenant
that he has parked incorrectly in the other tenant’s spot for over 5 weeks
without correction, and of the Tenant’s emailed reply on July 13, 2018, stating
his cousin and girlfriend were “house sitting” and that he will remedy the
situation;
•       
Exhibit LL#6 – copy of the
Landlord’s July 16, 2018 letter of notice to the Tenant, advising the Tenant of
excessive noise coming from the rental unit and of a large amount of garbage
piling outside the rental unit;
•       
Exhibit LL#7 – a series of
photos taken on July 11/13, 2018, August 2, 2018, August 28, 2018 and September
4, 2018, which show the continual growth of Tenant’s garbage piling up outside
the rental unit on the deck and stairs, and which show maggots on the deck and
stairs; and
•       
Exhibit LL#8 – a copy of the
City of Barrie’s August 17, 2018 letter to the Landlord concerning complaints
received from neighbours, placing the Landlord on notice that the increasing
collection of garbage outside the rental unit is in violation of city by-laws
and must be remedied by a given deadline.
Utility Bills
6.     
IL stated that despite a
number of attempts by the Landlord to notify the Tenant as to unpaid utility
bills (as exemplified by LL#1, LL#2, LL#3), the Tenant has yet to pay his 60%
share of the utility bills, which now totals $480.28.  The Landlord confirmed,
as well, that the Tenant has not attempted to remedy or void the N5 notice in
respect to unpaid utility bills.
7.     
As provided for under
subsection 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
based on the uncontested submission, I find Tenant failed to void the N5 notice
that was served on the Tenant on August 1, 2018.  As such, I find the Tenant’s conduct
with regard to utility bills has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful
right or interest of the Landlord.
Parking
8.     
IL submitted that the
Landlord duly notified the Tenant about the Tenant parking in the other
tenant’s spot and that the Tenant did indicate he would correct the situation. 
However, IL had the Landlord confirm at the hearing that the Tenant never did
correct the parking issue and is still parking in the wrong spot (per LL#4,
LL#5).
9.     
Here, I find the Tenant’s conduct
with regard to the issue of incorrect parking was not voided within the seven
day voiding period and has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment by the other tenant of the rental unit premises.
Noise
10.  
IL submitted that the issue
of noise, as evidenced by LL#6, was indeed remedied by the Tenant
satisfactorily and the Landlord withdraws that claim from this L2 application. 
As this presented no prejudice to the Tenant, I accept the Landlord’s
withdrawal of this particular claim.
Garbage
11.  
IL explained that the Tenant
and the other tenant of the building (in a different unit) both have been given
their own garbage, recycling and compost bins for garbage disposal.
12.  
IL stated that despite a
number of attempts by the Landlord to notify the Tenant about the increasing
collection of garbage immediately outside the rental unit went unheeded by the
Tenant to the point that the garbage started to rot badly enough to bring
maggots to the property (LL#7).  The Landlord testified that after the City of
Brampton placed him on notice (LL#8) about the unacceptable amount of garbage
piling up, he paid the other tenant of the rental unit premises to collect and
properly dispose of the garbage in August 2018.  However, IL stated the Tenant
has continued to store his garbage outside as late as September 4, 2018 (last
set of photos is LL#8).
13.  
Again, I find the Tenant’s conduct
with regard to the issue of not properly collecting and disposing his garbage
was not voided within the seven day voiding period and has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord or another tenant, and
the lawful rights of the Landlord.
Section 83
14.  
I made the foregoing
determinations orally at the hearing.  The Landlord confirmed his request under
the L2 application for a non-remedial termination of the tenancy, and requested
that the termination date be set for the standard eleven day period.  If
granted, the Landlord requested the L1 application be amended to be an order
for arrears only.
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The L1 application is hereby converted to an
order for arrears only as the tenancy is to be terminated in a non-remedial,
standard way under the L2 application.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 and L2 Applications
 
1.     
Due to a potential Canada
Post strike, the Landlord must immediately give a copy of this order to the
Tenant by:
•   
handing it to the Tenant;
•   
handing it to an apparently
adult person in the rental unit;
•   
placing it under the door of
the rental unit or through a mail slot in the door;
•   
leaving it in the Tenant’s
mailbox; or, 
•   
if there is no mailbox,
leaving it at the place where mail is ordinarily delivered to the Tenant.
The Landlord shall not use regular mail, registered mail or
courier to deliver this order. 
 
2.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated in a final way as of October 12, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before October 12, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,142.08*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to October 1, 2018 (date of this order), less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $50.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
October 2, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
7.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 12, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 13, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 12, 2018, then starting October 13, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
 
 
9.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 13, 2018.
