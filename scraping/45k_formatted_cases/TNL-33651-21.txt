In the
  matter of:


19 LEWIS
HONEY DRIVE AURORA ON L4G0H7


 




Between:


Krishnan Thavendraraiah


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennell Dawn
Hackett
Peter William Terrence Hackett


Tenants



 
 
 
Krishnan Thavendraraiah (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jennell Dawn Hackett and Peter William
Terrence Hackett (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard on
February 3, 2022. The Landlord’s
wife, Elina Thavendrartaiah, represented by Rajan Mahabalrijan, and the Tenants,
represented by Roz Bianchi, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
It is the Tenants’
position that the Landlord has served the notice in bad faith. The
Tenants point to the fact the Landlord has served
3 different N12 notices and they indicate differences in who will occupy the
rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenants also point to the fact it is the Landlord’s wife who served the notice for this application and not the Landlord.
 
3.     Elina Thavendrartaiah testified, and the affidavits submitted by the Landlord and his wife show, that the couple are
separating. The notices indicate
different individuals who will occupy the rental unit due to the circumstances
of who served the notice and what the intent was at the time. The notice that was served for this
application is for Elina Thavendrartaiah and their child to move into the
rental unit.
 
4.     The evidence shows that the Landlord is the owner of the property and signed the lease
with the Tenants. The Tenants argues
that it is not the Landlord who served the notice and therefore the notice
cannot terminate the tenancy.




 
5.    
The definition of landlord
in the Residential Tenancies Act includes any other person who
permits occupancy and the heirs, assigns, and personal representatives. It seems clear to me, by the fact that
both the Landlord and his wife submitting affidavits to the Board about their
good faith requirement to take personal
possession of the rental unit, and that it is the Landlord’s name on the
application who would have known his wife served the notice, that Elina
Thavendrartaiah was acting as a personal representative for her husband.
 
6.     I find the notice to terminate the tenancy is properly before
the Board.
 
7.     Based on the evidence and testimony, I find the Landlord in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
8.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,500.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
9.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal
to one month's rent.
 
10.  At the hearing, I canvassed the parties about delaying
the termination of the tenancy if the Board determined the tenancy should be
terminated for landlord’s own use. The
Tenant requested a delay until July 4, 2022. I find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until July 4, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of July 4, 2022. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before July 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$19,396.84, which represents compensation for the
use of the unit from June 17, 2021 to February 7, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$82.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 8, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 18, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before July 4, 2022,
then starting July 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after July 5, 2022.
