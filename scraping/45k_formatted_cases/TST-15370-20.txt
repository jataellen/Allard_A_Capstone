Eric Kai-Jun Fong and Sherry Ker-Man Li (the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that Davood Pourjam
(the 'Landlord') gave an N12 notice of termination in bad faith

This application was heard by videoconference on October 26, 2021.
 
The Tenants and Pouyan
Pourjam (‘PP’), the Landlord’s son and his representative, attended
the hearing. The Landlord did not attend the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The rental unit is a two-bedroom condo
apartment. The Tenants
moved into the rental unit on March 4, 2016.
 
Tenants’ evidence and
submissions
 
2.    The Tenants testified that on December 19, 2018, the
Landlord served them with an N12 Notice with a termination date of Feb 28,
2019. The N12 notice stated that the Landlord required possession of the rental unit for the purposes of residential occupation for his son.
 
3.    The Tenants testified
that as a result of the N12 notice they vacated the rental unit on
March 1, 2019. The monthly rent was $2687.00.
 
4.    The Tenants testified
that the Landlord’s son did not move into the rental
unit within a reasonable period of the time of them
vacating the rental unit.

into evidence a copy of MLS listing
(Exhibit C), evidencing that the rental unit was leased for $3200.00 per month on May 23,

7. 




 
8.   
The Tenants’ submitted into
evidence a transcript of the phone call of Dec 8, 2018 that they had with the Landlord’s son Pouyan
Pourjam where he tried to convince them to move out of the rental unit without the Landlord
paying them one month rent as
required by law and without
serving them with an N12 notice.
 
Landlord’s evidence and submissions
 
9.   
The Landlord’s son ‘PP’ testified that in 2019 he was working for a consulting firm that required
him to work part time in Waterloo since 2018.
 
10. PP testified that he
had an intention to live in the rental
unit when N12 Notice was served
to the Tenants’ on Dec 19, 2018.
 
11. PP submits that there was a change in his circumstance
because his employer relocated him to Waterloo,
and that required
him to put the rental
unit up for lease on May 22, 2019.
 
12. PP submitted into evidence two emails from his employer
(Exhibit B and C). The first email from his employer was dated April 4,
2019 stating that he will work three days a week in Waterloo. The second email
was dated May 2, 2019 stating that he will work five days a week in Waterloo
starting from May 20, 2019.
 
13. PP testified that from
April 2019 till June
15, 2019 he lived in a hotel that was paid by his employer.
 
14. PP testified that after June 2019 he lived with a friend in Waterloo.
The project was wrapped up in Sep 2019 and he moved
into his parent’s home in Toronto.
 
15. PP submitted into evidence a screen shot of
Expense Report (Exhibit
E) showing twelve transactions of expenses related
to his Waterloo project commute and hotel expenses from Oct 29, 2018 to July 5,
2019.
 
16. During the hearing
when the Tenant
asked a question
that why he did not immediately
move into the rental unit after they vacated. The Landlord’s son stated that he
did not immediately move into the rental unit because a window was broken, but
he failed to submit any evidence in support of his claim.
 
The
Law
 
 
17. This application was served pursuant
to subsection 57(1)(a) of the Act:
 
 
57 (1) The Board may make an order described in
subsection (3) if, on application by a former tenant of a rental unit, the
Board determines that,
(a) the landlord gave a notice
of termination under section 48 in bad faith, the former tenant vacated the
rental unit as a result of the notice or as a result of an application to or
order made by the Board based on the notice, and no person referred
to in clause 48
(1) (a), (b), (c) or (d) occupied the rental unit within a reasonable time
after the former tenant vacated the rental unit;




 
 
 
 
18. This section establishes a three-part test.
In order to be successful in their T5 application, the Tenants must establish
all three of the requirements of the section 57(1)(a) on a balance of
probabilities before the Board can order any of the remedies being requested by
the Tenants.
 
19. First, the Tenants must establish that the Landlord
gave the N12 notice of termination in bad faith. Second,
the Tenants must establish that they vacated
the rental unit as a result
of the N12 notice. Third, the Tenants must establish that no person listed in
the notice moved into the rental unit within a reasonable time after the Tenant
moved out.
 
Analysis
 
20. It was undisputed that the Tenants
moved out of the rental
unit as a result of an N12 Notice served by the Landlord
.
21. With respect to the issue of
whether the N12 notice was served in bad faith,
subsections 57(5) and 57(6) of the Act establish a rebuttable
presumption of bad faith in certain circumstances:
 
57(5) For the purposes
of an application under clause
(1)(a) and (c), it is presumed,
unlessthe contrary is proven on a balance of probabilities, that a landlord
gave a notice of termination under section 48 in bad faith, if at any time
during the period described in subsection (6) the landlord,
(a)   
advertises the rental unit rent;
 
57(6) The period referred
to in subsection (5) is the period
that,
(a)  
 begins on the day the landlord
gives the notice
of termination under section 48; and
(b)   
ends one year after the former
tenant vacates the rental unit.
 
22. It was undisputed that the rental
unit was listed less than one year of the Tenants
vacating pursuant to the N12 termination notice. Therefore, in
accordance with subsections 57(5) and 57(6) of the Act, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the Landlord served the N12 notice in bad faith. As result,
the burden falls on the
Landlord to establish that they did
not serve the notice of termination in bad faith.
 
23. I find that PP did not submit enough evidence to
establish that there was a change in his circumstances that prevented him from
living in the rental unit for at least twelve months after the Tenants vacated.
I find that he likely was only required to work in Waterloo on a temporary basis
after the Tenants
vacated, and this work arrangement did not prevent him from occupying the rental unit.
 
24. PP did not submit sufficient evidence showing that he was required to work in Waterloo for at least a year. The emails from his
employers (Exhibit B and C) did not say that he is




 
going to be relocated to Windsor for an extended period of time. I did not find the two emails from his employer to be
compelling on this point.
 
25. PP did not provide any evidence
to prove that he made efforts
to find a place on rent to live in Waterloo for longer period. While
in Waterloo he stayed at a Hotel or with a friend which does not indicate that
he intended to live in Waterloo on long-term basis
 
26. PP testified that while he was working in Waterloo, he
used to come to Toronto to visit his parents and his employer was paying for
his mileage for his personal travelling from Waterloo to Toronto. It is not a
common practice that an employer would paying for an employee’s personal
commuting to a permanent
work location. I have serious
difficulties in believing this
statement.
 
27. The rental unit was vacated on March 1, 2019. It was
not until May 2, 2019, that PP’s employer instructed him via email that he will work five days a week in Waterloo. There are two months
from the time the rental unit was vacated to the time when his employer
instructed him to work five days in Waterloo. During these two months PP did
not move unto the rental unit and took
no steps to change his address on personal documentation. PP’s explanation that
he did not move into the rental unit due to a broken window is implausible.
 
28. As such, I find that on the balance of probabilities
the Landlord has failed to rebut the presumption that he served the Tenants with the N12 Notice of termination in bad faith. The T5 remedies will be address in
the “remedies” section below.
 
Remedies
 
29. The Tenants’ application asks for a rent differential, cost of renting
two apartments for the
month of February 2019, elevator usage fee, utilities sub-meter set up fee for
new rental unit and a fine to the Landlord.
 
Rent Differential
 
30. Pursuant to section
57 of the Act, the Board may order that the Landlord
pay a specified sum to the Tenant
for all or any portion
of any increased rent that the Tenant
has had to pay for a one-year
period after vacating the rental unit.
 
31. The Tenants testified that that they leased a similar
new rental unit (two bedrooms, two washrooms
and a car parking) located in a building located
on Bay Street in Toronto. The Tenants submitted into evidence
(Exhibit 1B) the new Residential tenancy Agreement commencing from Feb 1, 2019
for $3100.00 per month. The cost of electricity is not included. The Tenants’
are responsible for paying their monthly electricity bill.
 
32. The Tenants’ were paying $2687.00 monthly rent when
they vacated the rental unit (Exhibit 0C and 0D) on March 1, 2019.
Their new monthly rent is $3100.00 plus electricity,
resulting in a monthly differential in the amount of
$413.00. Therefore, the Landlord will be
ordered to pay to the Tenants’ rent differential of $413.00 per month for the
maximum 12 months or $4,956.00.




 
 
 
33. The Tenants are also entitled
to get the additional electricity charges they must pay at their
the unit because electricity was included in their monthly rent for the rental
unit. The Tenants have provided
monthly Enercare electricity bill (Exhibits 2B-2L)
for the period
from March 1, 2019 to Jan 31, 2020, for a total amount of $835.70. The
total increased monthly charges for electricity will be awarded to the Tenants
for a twelve month period. I do not
think the Landlord is responsible for paying the electricity cost for February
2019 because the Tenants were in possession of the rental unit in February
2019.
 
Other Requested
Remedies
 
34. The Tenants requested that the Board grant a
reimbursement of expenses related to moving. The Tenants submitted into
evidence a copy of their Enercare electricity bill (Exhibit 2A) which shows a ‘Service
set up charge – Electricity’ of $35.00. plus HST 13%. The Tenants also claimed that they
had to reserve the elevator and have claimed an elevator usage fee (Exhibit 3B)
of $150.00
 
35. The Tenants’ are bound by the new lease agreement to
pay for the electricity. However, the electricity was included in the lease
agreement at the rental unit. I am awarding these two claimed amounts because the Tenants’ did incur
these expenses in moving to the new unit. Both claim amounts are
supported by documents.
 
36. The Tenants have also claimed $3100.00 that represents the additional cost of paying
the rent of two units for the month of February 2019. The Tenants stated
that it was not feasible to move out on February 28, 2019 and move into a new
rental unit on March 1, 2019. I am
unable to find the Landlord
liable for the cost of paying the
rent for two units in February 2019.
The Tenants submitted no evidence to prove that moving
out on February 28, 2019 and moving into the new rental unit on March
1, 2019 was not feasible. The request for an order for cost of $3100.00 to rent
two units for the month of February 2019 is denied.
 
The Tenants’
also requested the Board order the Landlord pay an administrative fine for
breach of the Act. The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 16 provides
insight into the Board’s
use of fines and states that an administrative fine is a remedy to be used to
encourage compliance with the Act and to deter landlords from engaging in
similar activity in the
future: “This remedy is not normally
imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant
disregard for the Act and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence
and compliance.”
 
37. In the present
case, as the Tenants have been awarded
a substantial monetary
remedy, I find that this provides a sufficient deterrent. The request for an order
for an administrative fine is
denied.
 
38. Therefore, Tenants are entitled to $5,981.25 for this T5 application which
is calculated as follows:
