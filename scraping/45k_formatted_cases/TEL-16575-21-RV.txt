Review Order
 
Canadian
Student Living Group, Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Habbi-ann
Powell (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-16575-21 issued on September
15, 2021. On September 27,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
On October
1, 2021, interim
order TEL-16575-21-RV-IN was issued staying
the order dated September 15, 2021.
 
The review hearing was held by videoconference on
December 20, 2021. The Tenant and the Landlord’s Agent, Emily Barbati
attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.    
The Tenant did not receive the Notice of Hearing. I find the Tenant did not have an
adequate opportunity to participate in the hearing held on July 14, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to August 27, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 22, 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $605.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
