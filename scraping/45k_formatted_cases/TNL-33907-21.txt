Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Amanda Black (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 8, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s representative, J. Paine, attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to November 30,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $5.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.    
The Tenant
paid $8,272.60 after
the application was filed. The payment covered
all the arrears and a portion
of the application fee.
 
4.    
The Tenant
owes $136.40, which
represents the balance
of the cost of filing
of the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$136.40 for the balance of the cost of filing the
application.
