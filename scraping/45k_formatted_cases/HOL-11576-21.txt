Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11576-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


25 SYDNEY CIRCLE WOODBRIDGE ON L4H4R2


 




Between:


Haojie Li Zhaoran
Wang


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Antoinette Dumuje Sessil(richard) Malcolm


Tenants



 
 
 
Haojie Li and
Zhaoran Wang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sessil(richard) Malcolm and
Antoinette Dumuje (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlords for the damage.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. The Landlord,
Zhaoran Wang, and the Tenant Antoinette Dumuie, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The rental unit the Tenants reside
in is approximately 2 ½ years old.
 
2.    
On April 30, 2021 a storm with strong winds, forecast
on April 29th to be up to 70 to 80
km/h, hit the area.
 
3.    
The window
in the rental unit was left open and the strong winds blew the window out of
its casing. The window dropped from
the second-floor unit to the driveway below. Photographs show the damage.
Based on the evidence this window required
replacing. The evidence shows the Landlord paid $480.00 to replace the
window.
 
4.    
The Tenant argues that it was a defect in the window that caused the damage. The Tenant testified that she was at work
at the time.
 
5.    
The Tenants’
father was home with the Tenants’ child
at the time.

6.    
Considering the fact
the storm had been predicted, there was an adult at home at the time and the
window was left open, the Landlord had the builder look into whether there was a defect which would be covered under warranty and there is no evidence
there was a defect, I find the
Tenants are responsible for the damage caused to the window. The Landlords have
incurred costs of $480.00 to replace property that was damaged and cannot be
reasonably repaired.
 
7.    
Under the circumstances I find it would be unreasonable to terminate the tenancy. The Tenants will be ordered to pay for the
cost of the damage.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $480.00, which represents the reasonable costs of replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
The Tenants
owe the Landlord
$666.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords
have the right to collect
the full amount at any time.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before January 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
