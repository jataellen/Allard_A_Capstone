uncontested evidence was the Tenant vacated the rental unit on March 31, 2021. As such, the request
for eviction under
this application is no
longer necessary.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $2,148.30 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,502.66 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
