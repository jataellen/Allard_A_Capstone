Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11722-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2647 DEPUTY
MINISTER PATH OSHAWA ON
  L1L0M7


 




Between:


Fangyu Jiang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Henry Macpherson Kimberly Lynn Macpherson
Stephanie Lynn Joan
Macpherson


Tenants



 
 
 
Fangyu Jiang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Henry Macpherson, Kimberly
Lynn Macpherson and Stephanie Lynn Joan Macpherson (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1); and because
they have been persistently late in paying their rent (L2).
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
1, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Bita Di Lisi, and the Tenant Kimberley Lynn Macpherson, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 12, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,050.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from May 5, 2021 to
August 12, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants moved into the rental unit in late 2020. They have not paid rent for the past
eleven months. The Tenant testified
that they have had financial hardship and illness and are seeking relief from
eviction. The Tenant claims to have
offered to pay an extra
$200.00 per month. This would take nearly ten years to pay the Landlord and there is no
evidence the Tenants can afford the current rent.
 
5.     The Landlord’s representative submits that she attempted to contact the Tenants to work
on a solution on 17 separate occasions, by registered letters,
phone calls, email,
and the




 
Tenants have not responded to any of these attempts.
The Tenant denied
these attempts testified that she was only contacted one time.
 
6.     The Landlord’s representative was very specific
about each of the dates and detailed about how each attempt was made. I prefer the submission from the
Landlord’s representative over that of the Tenant considering the amount of
arrears that have accumulated and the fact the Tenants made no effort to
contact the Landlord.
 
7.     I find the Tenants have also been persistently late paying rent. As such, this order cannot
be voided by the Tenants.
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $23,136.84*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$67.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 15, 2022, then starting February
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
