Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36041-21
 



In the matter
of:


304, 5950 BATHURST STREET NORTH YORK ON M2R1Y9


 




Between:


Rosslyn Residences


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Cedric Cyr Marguerite Kelemen


Tenants



 
On November
12, 2021, Rosslyn Residences (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marguerite Kelemen and Cedric Cyr (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on November 8, 2021 with respect to application TNL-30968-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
When served with a 24-hour notice
of entry for pest control,
the Tenants were to
fully cooperate with the Landlord and contractors and ready the unit for pest
control treatment.
 
The Landlord served the Tenants with a 24-hour notice
of entry for pest control treatment on November
10, 2021. When the technician attended the unit,
he noted that the Tenants did
not fully prepare the unit for treatment and the unit was quite cluttered with
cardboard boxes. The Tenants failed
to fully cooperate and ready the unit for pest control treatment.
 
3.    
The Tenants
were ordered to pay $186.00
for costs in Order
TNL-30968-21. The amount owing has been paid in full.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,920.70 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 6, 2022.
