Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35732-19
 
 
 
RS (the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that RVPI, HD, and JD (the 'Landlords') failed
to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations
under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of
a vital service that the Landlords are obligated to supply under the tenancy
agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 16,
2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021in Passcode
215 965 491 VC 75. Only the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing
on June 16, 2021 and only the Tenant’s
representative, AB-S, attended
the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf
of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief
for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by
each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and
inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and
the effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35732-19 is
one of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded to completion on July 22, 2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75
following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-35732-19 proceeded on June
16, 2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.    The Tenant claims for two classes of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior to the
Park’s effective closure in October 2018; and second; those attributable to the
closure.
 
3.   
I
find the following
facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant;
 
a)     The Tenant had lived at the Park for
three years before he vacated
in September 2018 in response
to the Park’s imminent closure;
 
b)     The Tenant paid rent of $385 per month at the Park;
 
c)     
The Tenant and his daughter were impacted by the water
and sewage problems. The Tenant showered at a
friend’s house. He and his daughter were starting to get spots on their skin
from the water. The Tenant’s unit was located in the lower level of the Park, close to the Park’s septic
bed. The Tenant would have to drive through seeping sewage in the road. He.could not allow his young daughter to play in the playground which he had built
at his unit because of the seeping and bubbling sewage there;
 
d)     The Tenant suffered
a loss of more than $15,000.00 in the value of the
trailer




 
 
 
e)    
The Tenant stayed in the basement
of a friend’s house after he left the Park and
paid less for rent than he had at the Park; and
;
f)      
Departure from the Park
impacted the Tenant’s visits with his daughter. After leaving the Park he moved
into a friend’s basement. That
location was unsuitable for his daughter to come to visit so he visited her at the home of his ex-wife,
who would leave to allow him to visit.
 
First Type of Remedies
- for the Period Prior
to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I
have considered compensation for events occurring between March
15 2018, being one year prior to when
this application was filed, and September 2018, when the Tenant
vacated the Park.
 
5.    I find that the Tenant is entitled
to a rebate of $125.80,
being 5% of the $385.00
monthly rent at the Park from mid-March 2018 through September 2018 for
problems with the water.
 
6.   
I find that the impact on the
Tenant of the sewage issues was particularly strong because of his unit’s proximity to major components of the sewage system. I find that he is entitled
to a rebate of $635.63, being 25% of the $385.00 monthly rent at the Park for
the 6 ½ month period from mid-March 2018 through
September 2018 for the impacts of the
Landlords’ failure to maintain or repair the sewage system.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
7.   
For the second type of remedies,
as set out in the Base Order, I find
the following:
 
a)     The Tenant is not entitled
to compensation for the loss of value of the value
of the mobile home; and
 
b)    
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable
enjoyment.
 
8.    I considered whether to award the Tenant damages for
interference with reasonable enjoyment. I recognize
that it is likely that the months leading up to the Tenant’s decision to vacate would have been
difficult for the Tenant, particularly in light of the impact on his daughter. The
Tenant mitigated the impacts in part by moving to new accommodation in advance
of receiving confirmation of the Park’s closure. I find that a damages award of
$500.00 is warranted in the circumstances.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $1,261.43, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $761.43 for the impacts
of the problems with the water and sewage systems; and
 
b)     $500.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
