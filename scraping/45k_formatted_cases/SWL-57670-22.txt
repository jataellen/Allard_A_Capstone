In the
  matter of:


12, 94 KING EDWARD
AVENUE LONDON ON N5Z3S8


 




Between:


King Edward
Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dwight Elliott


Tenant



 
 
 
King Edward Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Dwight Elliott (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on January 13, 2022 with respect to application
SWL-54318-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: On January 20, 2022 at 7:00 pm, one of the
Landlord’s employees witnessed the Tenant throwing a bag of dog feces onto a growing pile of bags of feces
next to the back door of the Residential building
therefore interfering with the reasonable enjoyment of the Residential Complex.
 
3.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,266.08 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 1, 2020 to February 8, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-54318-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57670-22
 
3.    
As of the date of this order, the
Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$1,267.36.
 
4.    
The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$41.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay any amounts that become owing
as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.

The tenant has until February 18, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 18, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 20, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
