In the
  matter of:


29 CAPREOL AVENUE AURORA ON L4G0Z8


 




Between:


Yujiao Cheng


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Justin Bradford Trigg


Tenant



 
 
 
Yujiao Cheng (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin Bradford Trigg
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
3, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Virginia Guo, attended the hearing the Tenant, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant argues that the Landlord did not pay the
compensation required before the termination date on the N12 notice to
terminate the tenancy. The evidence
shows that the Landlord made out a cheque to pay the Tenant well before the termination date. The Landlord
testified that when she went to the rental home, the Tenant’s mother quickly
closed the door when she tried to give her the cheque.
The Landlord further
testified that she placed the
envelope under the door. The cheque
was not cashed by the Tenant.
 
2.     The cheque has since become stale dated and in good
faith the Landlord gave the Tenant a second cheque. Based on the evidence provided and the testimony, I find on a
balance of probabilities, the Landlord
paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's
rent.
 
3.     The Tenant also argues the Landlord has not sold the property
because there are multiple purchase and sale agreements.
 
4.     The agreements were also submitted
as evidence by the Landlord.
They show that the
closing date has changed. The
Landlord testified that this was because the closing is based upon the
purchaser gaining vacant possession. Because
the Tenant has not vacated the home the date has changed. One of the agreements shows that the




 
Landlord agreed to pay the purchaser
$35,000.00 due to the delay. The Landlord requires an order terminating the
tenancy for the sale to close.
 
5.     I find that Min Yao Jiang has an agreement
with the Landlord
to purchase the residential
complex and in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The
closing date is March 31, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord has filed an affidavit sworn by the person who personally requires
the rental unit certifying
that the person in good faith requires the rental unit for his or her own
personal use.
 
7.    
The Tenant was asked how much time
would be required to vacate the home if the tenancy is to be terminated. Based on the fact the Tenant has resided in the home for
approximately five years, I find a delay is appropriate.
 
8.     The purchaser is currently living in a condominium
that the purchaser owns and has not sold that residence. I find the prejudice to the Tenant is greater that of the
purchaser if there is no relief granted.
The purchaser did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of April 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,851.75, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 15, 2021
to February 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
