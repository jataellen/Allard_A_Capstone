Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-24794-21
 



In the matter
of:


APT 10,
2 NORMANDY DRIVE GUELPH ON N1E2P1


 




Between:


Livia Szecsenyi Istvan Szecsenyi


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Stavros Theodorakopoulos
  Tania Theodorakopoulos


Tenants



 
 
Livia Szecsenyi and Istvan Szecsenyi (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stavros Theodorakopoulos and Tania
Theodorakopoulos (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlords attended the hearing. As of 10:50 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The Landlords stated to ensure the Tenants could participate in the hearing,
on January 10, 2022
they had sent the Tenants an email which included the log in information for the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of
January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$1,466.40.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,449.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from September 10, 2020 to September 17, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $675.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $4,558.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$48.21 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 28, 2022, the Tenants pay the
amount of $6,773.40** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January 29, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
