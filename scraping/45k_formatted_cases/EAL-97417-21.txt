Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97417-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


316 CHURCH STREET NAPANEE ON K7R3P1


 




Between:


Paul Vine


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Colleen
Duphney (mcewen)


Tenant



 
 
 
Paul Vine (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Colleen
Duphney (mcewen) (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of
residential occupation
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 10:15 AM. Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord testified at the hearing that the Tenant had
vacated the rental unit prior to
the hearing date. As the only remedy sought by the Landlord
in the application was the termination of the tenancy, the
application is accordingly dismissed as moot.
 
2.    
The Landlord
attempted to raise
a claim for damage to the rental
unit by the Tenant. No such claim was included in the original
application, nor was any amended application provided. This dismissal is therefore expressly without prejudice to any
L10 or other application that the Landlord may bring against
the Tenant in relation to these claims,
as they did not form part of this application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
