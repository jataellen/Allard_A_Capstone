Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-04353-19
 











 
 
 

T.M. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.P. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Peterborough on October
10, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
As a result
of a Superior Court of Justice order suspending the enforcement of LTB eviction
orders during the period from March 19, 2020 to July 31, 2020, the issuance of
this Order has been delayed. Any payments made by the Tenant(s) to the Landlord
after the application was filed by the Landlord must deducted from the amount
ordered by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The application is amended
to remove a second named tenant respondent. He is actually not a tenant as he
rented a room from the Tenant after she entered into the tenancy agreement with
the Landlord. 
2.     
The Tenant disputes the
amount owing alleged by the Landlord. But after reviewing with the Tenant at
the hearing the payments made and the Landlord’s paperwork, I am satisfied that
the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 as alleged by the Landlord.  Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 1,
2019.
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is
$900.00.
4.     
As of the date of hearing
before the Board the arrears of rent owing for the period ending October 31,
2019 total $3,600.00.
5.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
6.     
The Tenant says she has a
last month’s rent deposit that was paid to the Landlord by the O.D.S.P.
(‘ODSP’). The Landlord says that is not true and the Tenant in fact signed an
acknowledgement indicating the Landlord is not holding a deposit. Absent
something more I am not prepared to make a finding that the Landlord is holding
a last month’s rent deposit for the Tenant. 
7.     
That leaves the issue of
relief from eviction. The Tenant seeks a repayment plan of $400.00 a month. That
represents a ten-month repayment period. The Tenant says that if she cannot get
the repayment plan requested, she needs a delay in the eviction of two months. The
Landlord asks for a standard voidable eviction order. 
8.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this for
the following reasons. 
9.     
The Tenant cannot actually
afford the repayment plan she proposes based on her own evidence concerning her
income and expenses. She says the short fall would be covered by her mother but
her mother has no legal obligation to support the Tenant nor does she have a
legal relationship with the Landlord. At best the Tenant could afford $300.00 a
month which would require more than a year of payments to get to a zero
balance. 
10.  
The Tenant is in receipt of
ODSP and has custody of one grandchild and is seeking custody of another. Her
daughter passed away in February of 2019. The Tenant has lived in the rental
unit for about two and a half years as of the hearing before the Board and says
this is the first time the Landlord has brought an application concerning the
tenancy. 
11.  
The Landlord says the
Tenant’s non-payment is causing financial hardship. He is losing his job at the
end of November, 2019 so the repayment plan would simply prolong his financial distress.

12.  
As stated above, the Tenant
cannot afford the repayment plan she proposes. Given that and the Landlord’s
evidence concerning his own finances, it would be unfair in all of the
circumstances to grant the relief requested. Given the passage of time since
the hearing before the Board, the Tenant has essentially gained by default much
more than the two months delay of eviction that she sought in the alternative. 
13.  
Given all of the above, the
Board’s standard voidable eviction order shall issue. 
14.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August
15, 2020.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,600.00 for arrears of rent up to October 31, 2019. 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November
1, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August 15, 2020, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 16, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 15, 2020, then starting August 16, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 16, 2020.
8.     
If, at any time between the
hearing held on October 10, 2019 and August 15, 2020, the Tenant reached a zero
balance owing, then, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  For
example:
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $3,775.00 on or before October 31, 2019, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $4,675.00 on or before November 30, 2019, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $5,575.00 on or before December 31, 2019, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $6,475.00 on or before January 31, 2020, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $7,375.00 on or before February 29, 2020, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $8,275.00 on or before March 31, 2020, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $9,175.00 on or before April 30, 2020, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $10,075.00 on or before May 31, 2020, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $10,975.00 on or before June 30, 2020, then this order is void;
•       
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $11,875.00 on or before July 31, 2020, then this order is void; or 
•        
If the Tenant paid to the
Landlord $12,775.00 on or before August 15, 2020 October 31, 2019, then this
order is void.
If
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the
Tenant pays the amount required under that subsection on or after August 16,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant
is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
10.  
Any payments made by the
Tenant to the Landlord after the hearing held on October 10, 2019, shall be
deducted from the total amount owing under this order.
