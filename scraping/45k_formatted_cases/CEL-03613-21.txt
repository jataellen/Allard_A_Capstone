  MISSISSAUGA ON L5B2S6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard James Campbell Troy Donavin Waterman


Tenants



 
 
 
Rongling Zhang (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Troy Donavin Waterman
and Richard James Campbell (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant. ; because they or another occupant of the rental unit have
committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade,
business or occupation in the rental unit or the
residential complex involving the production of an illegal drug, the
trafficking in an illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug for the
purposes of trafficking.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord, represented by Irfan Farooq, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord alleges
the Tenants are growing marijuana
at the rental home in excess of the number of plants permitted under
the Cannabis Act in Ontario.
 
2.     The Landlord testified that she has personally seen
that the Tenants are growing approximately 20 plants at the rental property. The Tenants’ test message to the Landlord enquires
about what happened
to the five marijuana plants
he was growing.
 
3.     Section 12(4) of the Cannabis Act states the unless
authorized under the Act, it is prohibited for an individual who is 18 years of
age or older to cultivate, propagate or harvest, or to offer to cultivate, propagate or harvest,
more than four cannabis plants
at any one time in their dwelling-house.




 
4.    
Based on the uncontested testimony and evidence
before me, I find the Tenants have committed an illegal act by growing
more than four marijuana plants.
 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
19, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $3,927.26, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from November 1, 2021 to February 14, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 15, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 19, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
