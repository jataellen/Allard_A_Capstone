and


 




 


Luis Velasquez Donoso


Tenant



 
On November 8,
2021, Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Luis Velasquez Donoso (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on February 25, 2021
with respect to application TNL-25116-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the
following condition specified in the order: The Tenant was to refrain from committing an illegal act or carrying
on an illegal trade,
business or occupation or permitting a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential
complex, commencing as of the date of the order and continuing for twelve
months thereafter until February 24, 2022.
 
On November 3,
2021 at approximately 6:17 pm, the Toronto Police Services executed a search
warrant at the unit and located quantities of crack cocaine, powder cocaine,
clonazepam, alprazolam, kapanol, and Canadian currency, all which were seized
and which the Toronto Police Services officers deemed to be indicative of drug
trafficking. The Tenant has breached a condition of the order by permitting an illegal act to be committed at the rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TNL-36103-21-EX
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
