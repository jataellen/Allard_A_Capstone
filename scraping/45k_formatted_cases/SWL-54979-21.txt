In the
matter of:


1118, 170 KENT STREET
  LONDON ON N6A1L4


 




Between:


London &
Middlesex Community Housing


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Amin Saab


Tenant



 
On September 15, 2021,
London & Middlesex Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied
in this L4 application for an
order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Amin Saab (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the hearing order issued by the
Board on July 8, 2021 with respect to L1 application SWL-47081-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous hearing order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet
certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$100.00 on or before September
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting hearing order
required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent.
Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an
order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$5,773.31 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in hearing
Order SWL-47081-20. The amount that is still owing
from that order is $5,562.31 and that amount is included in this order. As a
result, the previous order SWL-47081-20 is cancelled.
 
5.       
On March 9, 2011 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $77.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit was paid out to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020. There is no further interest owing. There
was no guideline rent increase allowed (and consequently no interest on
deposit) for 2021 due to COVID19.




 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Previous hearing order SWL-47081-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,485.13*. This amount represents the rent owing up to September 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$16.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
January 4, 2022

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
