6965083 Canada Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Josip Keran (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration
charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Kenia Afolabi,
attended the hearing.
As of 2:38 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 6, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,692.21.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $60.00
for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,692.21 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
