Order under Section
126
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
 
 
 



 


 


 




 


 


 




 


 


 



 
MMCITF xxx S.A (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order permitting the rent
charged to be increased by more than the guideline for one or more of the
rental units in the residential complex.
 
This application was resolved by written hearing.
No submissions were received from the
Tenant.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
justified a rent increase above
the guideline because
of capital expenditures.
 
2.                 
The maximum
rent increase above the guideline
because of capital
expenditure is 2.40%. This
increase is for the capital expenditure for Roof Replacement.
 
3.                 
The Landlord is seeking
an order permitting it to raise the rent above the annual guideline amount because of a capital
expenditure it has incurred for replacement
of the roof at the residential complex.
 
4.                 
The residential complex
is made up of 6 units, but the application indicates that the above guideline
increase in the cost for the roof replacement should only be calculated based
on 4 units. This means that those 4 units would bear all of the costs of the
capital expenditure. This is not in keeping with the scheme of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The roof replacement benefits all 6 units. Therefore, the cost should be apportioned as between all 6 units. However,
the application only applies to the 4 units identified by the Landlord.
Therefore, the apportioned increase granted will only apply to those units
covered by the application and unit numbers 3 and 5 will receive no increase.
 
5.                 
The Landlord
claims the roof at the residential complex
was leaking badly and




required
replacement. The Landlord claims the roof replacement is an eligible capital
expenditure pursuant to s.126(7)(a) and (b) of the Act. These subsections of
the Act stipulate the work is necessary to protect or restore the physical
integrity of the residential complex
and for the Landlord to comply with s.20(1) of the Act which stipulates that a
landlord is responsible for repairing/maintaining the residential complex.
 
6.                 
I am satisfied the
Landlord has established that this capital expenditure is an eligible capital
expenditure which satisfies the requirements of s.126(7) of the Act. The capital expenditure is necessary to restore the physical integrity of the residential complex
and for the Landlord
to comply with the requirements of s. 20(1) of the
Act.
 
7.                 
The Certificate of
Service filed by the Landlord on November 2, 2020, indicates that some rental units
listed in the application were not served
with the application and notice of hearing. The
Board shall therefore amend the application by removing these rental units. As
a result, this order for a rent increase above the guideline under section 126
of the Act does not apply to the following units: 1, 2 and 4.
 
8.                 
The weighted
useful life for the capital
expenditure is 25 years.
 
9.                 
The first effective date of the rent increase above the guideline is March 1, 2020.
 
10.             
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order within 30
days of the date of this order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
may increase the rent charged
by 2.40% for the unit set out in the order.
 
2.                 
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 1 is to be taken within the time
period of March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021.
 
3.                 
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 1 may be taken in addition to the
annual guideline in effect on the increase date for the unit.
 
4.                 
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order within 30
days of the date of this order.
 
5.                 
If the Tenant’s rent is
increased pursuant to the percentage increase ordered for capital expenditures
and the same Tenant remains in the unit after the expiration of the weighted
useful life for capital expenditures, then the rent will be reduced.
Refer to Schedule 1 for information about the date and amount of the rent reduction.




6.                 
The annual guideline for 2020 is 2.2%
and for 2021 is 0%.

Important Notes:

part of the ordered increase that is not taken within the time period specified
cannot be added to subsequent rent increases in subsequent time periods.
 
2.

for a rent increase that is less than the ordered increase,
the landlord may only take the rent increase set out
in the Notice.
 
3.                 
The ordered increase
does not affect tenants who moved into the complex on or after December
2, 2019. The landlord cannot
add the ordered increase to the rents these tenants pay.
