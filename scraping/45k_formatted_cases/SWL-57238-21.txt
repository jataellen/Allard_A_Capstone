Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


11
  EMERSON AVE LEAMINGTON ON N8H5B7


 




Between:


Leamington Nonprofit Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


William Macdonald


Tenant



 
 
 
Leamington Nonprofit Housing (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict William Macdonald (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on August 19, 2021 with respect to application SWL-51970-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $228.00 towards
the arrears, on or before November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $2,736.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-51970-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,736.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-51970-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-51970-21 is cancelled.
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.

3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $3,363.39*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 7, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.77 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.

The tenant has until January 17, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 17, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
