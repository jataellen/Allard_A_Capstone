In the
  matter of:


23497 WOODBINE AVENUE KESWICK ON L4P0L5


 




Between:


Sing Wing
Szeto


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Craig Bernard Nicole M Bernard


Tenants



 
 
 
Sing Wing Szeto (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Nicole M Bernard and Craig Bernard (the 'Tenants')
because they, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted
in the residential complex have seriously impaired
the safety of any
person; and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the
damage; and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. ; The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
3, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Barrington Lue Sang, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N7 notice to terminate the tenancy. An N7 notice is for a serious breach of a tenant’s obligation
under the Residential Tenancies Act. The
seriousness of the breach is demonstrated by the fact a tenant has not chance
to remedy the breach, a landlord can file the application with the Board
immediately, the Board will expedite the application to a hearing, and the
Sheriff is directly to enforce the order before all other orders.
 
2.     The allegations in the notice date back two years. They include a big hole in the wall, which
has been repaired; Fixtures removed in the bedroom and living room; a pole
removed from the deck; the Tenants’
BBQ obstructed air flow; the Tenants’ above ground pool was obstructing water
flow to other tenants; the Tenants refused to cooperate with a contractor; the
Tenants’ children threw garbage; the Tenants stored personal belongings in the furnace
room; damage to a sewage pump; a complaint about

the dryer not working and the
Landlord found it was working; a complaint about water quality and the Landlord
found no problem
which created a lot of inconvenience for the
Landlord; the Tenants’ snow remover damaged a screen; and complaints about the
Tenants from other tenants.
 
3.     I find that because a pole on a deck was removed,
which the photographs show to be approximately one foot off the ground,
does not meet the test of seriously impaired safety.
 
4.     The balance of the allegations do not meet the legal test of serious as required to terminate this tenancy based on an N7
notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
