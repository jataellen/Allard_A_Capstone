                                   Tenant



Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18644-20
 
 
 
Niagara Regional Housing (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Victor McCarty (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Jennifer Bailey, attended the hearing. As of 10:38 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
27, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $873.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,872.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.




File Number: SOL-18644-20
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,389.44*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $28.70
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 26, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 25,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $12,721.00** to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount required
under that subsection on or after February 26, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
