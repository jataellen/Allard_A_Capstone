Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23417-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR,
1736 KEELE STREET TORONTO ON M6M3W8


 




Between:


Giambattista ( John ) Dell'edera


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Flavio Miranda Melissa Miranda Rosina Pacilli Steve Miranda


Tenants



 
 
 
Giambattista ( John ) Dell'edera (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Flavio Miranda, Melissa
Miranda, Steve Miranda and Rosina Pacilli (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     At the commencement of the hearing,
the Landlord advised
that the Tenants
had vacated the rental unit at the end of October 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
served the Tenant with an N12 notice of termination seeking termination of the
tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by his son. The termination
date in the Form N12 was September 30, 2021.
The Landlord has met the 60 day notice requirement of s.48(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”), and did not apply for per diem
compensation after the termination date.
 
3.    
The Landlord
testified he provided the Tenants with two months compensation for the months
of August 2021 and September 2021. I
am satisfied that the Landlord has met the one month’s compensation requirement
of s. 48.1 of the Act.




File Number: TSL-23417-21
 
4.    
The Landlord stated that his son
is looking to move from the Landlord’s house to the rental unit. The Landlord’s son lives alone, and the
rental unit is conveniently located close to his place of work. I am satisfied, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Landlord,
in good faith, requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation by his son.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
October 31, 2021.
