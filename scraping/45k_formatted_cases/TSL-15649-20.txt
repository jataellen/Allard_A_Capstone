Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-15649-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


3511, 15 FORT YORK BOULEVARD TORONTO ON M5V3Y4


 




Between:


Chengwei Dong


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Omar Gouda
  Zinab Gouda


Tenants



 
 
 
Chengwei Dong
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Omar
Gouda and Zinab Gouda (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on October 8, 2021. The Landlord and his Representative, Rong-Wei Yu attended the
hearing. As of 12:07 p.m. the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
as it appears from the
Certificate of Service.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
based on a voidable Notice of Termination (form ‘N5”) served on the Tenants on April 23, 2020 with a termination date of May 23, 2020 because the Tenants
or an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential
complex by the Tenants have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the rental unit and residential complex by allowing the
bathtub in their unit to overflow, causing damage to the units below.
 
2.    
An investigation by the condominium management and discovered the Tenants had used
paper towels in the toilet, cause a blockage which prevented the tub to
overflow. Management was not notified of any problems
prior to the discovery of the damage
to the units below.
 
3.    
The Landlord
has incurred costs of $7,873.46 to repair the damage.




File Number: TSL-15649-20
 
4.    
When confronted about the damage the Tenants
refused to pay. The Tenants
then vacated the rental unit in June 2020.
 
5.    
As the Tenants have vacated the rental unit, eviction consideration is moot. The only
issue before the Board is the damage caused by the Tenants’ actions.
 
6.    
Based on the
uncontested evidence of the Landlord I am satisfied the Tenants wilfully or
negligently caused damage to the rental unit and the rental complex,
and are responsible for the reasonable costs to repair the damage
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
June 30, 2020, the date the Tenants gave vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord $7,873.46, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 16, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
