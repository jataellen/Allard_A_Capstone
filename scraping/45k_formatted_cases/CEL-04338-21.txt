Order under
Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
CEL-04338-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
GROUND LEVEL, 20 MORADO COURT BRAMPTON ON L6S4H7


 




Between:


Puthuva Varghese


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Evelyn Cornish


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 9, 2021, Puthuva
Varghese (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Evelyn
Cornish (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord and the Tenant signed
an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 1, 2022.
 
2.       
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date,
it is not appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application
filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 1, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.




File Number: CEL-04338-21
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
 
 
 
4.       
The tenant has until January
21, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 77(6)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
21, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
 
5.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August
2, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
