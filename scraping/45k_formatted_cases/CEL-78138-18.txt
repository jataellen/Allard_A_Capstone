Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 











 
 
 

AMZ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict ADA (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on October
31, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, DJ, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenants raised
the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'): failure to maintain the rental unit in a good state of
repair, and substantial interference with the use of the backyard.
 
The following witness testified at
the hearing:
WM (Tenant’s friend) on behalf of
the Tenant 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant disputed the rent
arrears of $4,600.00 owing to October 31, 2018 as claimed by the Landlord in
this application.  The Tenant asserted that he does not owe any rent and has
paid his rent in cash to the Landlord.  He further submitted that the Landlord
has no rental ledgers and never provided any receipts. 
2.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenant complied with interim order CEL-78138-18-IN issued September 12,
2018 and made two payments to the Landlord of $425.00 each in the month of
October 2018.  These payments were made by e-transfers sent to the Landlord.
3.     
The Landlord stated that the
Tenant has been in arrears of rent for a long time.  He has continued to
message him in an attempt to collect the rent.  Copies of the text messages
between the parties was submitted into evidence. He also stated that the Tenant
and another tenant in the complex work together and that other tenant has paid
money on behalf of this Tenant in the past.  However according to the Landlord,
the other tenant stopped paying money on this Tenant’s behalf a while ago.  
4.     
The Tenant’s witness, WM,
who is the other tenant at the complex in question, testified that the Tenant
gave multiple payments to the Landlord in cash.  He referred to the Landlord’s
text messages which confirm that the Tenant paid money in both September 2017
and March 2018.
5.     
Cash payments are difficult
to establish without receipts and/or bank statements.  The evidence before me
was insufficient to find that the Tenant made additional cash payments to the
Landlord than those already accounted for in the application.  The Landlord’s
text messages to the Tenant confirmed that the Landlord over and over again
requested rental payments from the Tenant and did not receive full payment.  
6.     
According to the text
messages in evidence, on December 19, 2017 the Landlord texted the Tenant “Can
you drop the money with W?”  The Tenant’s reply text stated “I paid you last
week, I owe you 2 now.” The Landlord replied “2 and this month Last month was
for November.” And the Tenant replied “Ok.”
7.     
Also, on February 25, 2018,
the Tenant, in response to another request from the Landlord for payment,
texted “I send you something on the weekend like I said.”  “I owe you 4 months
plus this month bro.” “And out of it I’ve given you $200.00 I know am late but
ima send you something this week.”  The Landlord’s reply was “Yeah that’s 5 and
now March is here Thursday, which is 6.”
8.     
The message on March 19,
2018 that the witness referred to was sent by the Tenant to the Landlord and stated
“I might be 75dollars short for one month.”  And then on March 22, 2018, the
Tenant followed up with that text and stated that “the transfer is pending…let
me know when you get it.” The Landlord responded on March 23, 2018 that
“nothing came through” “send me a screen shot.”   
9.     
The Landlord’s application
disclosed varying payments received from the Tenant for the period of July 1,
2017 to August 31, 2018, however there are still rent arrears outstanding. 
Given the dialogue via text messages between the parties, I find it more likely
than not that the Tenant did not pay the rent arrears in full.   As well, I am
satisfied that the Tenant sent the Landlord payments via e-transfer, yet the
Tenant did not provide any of those receipts in support of his assertion.   Given
that there were payments made by e-transfers, I find that the Tenant’s and WM’s
evidence that only cash payments were made to the Landlord not to be credible. 
10.  
Consequently, I am satisfied
that the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for
the period from July 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 27, 2018.
11.  
The Tenant paid $850.00
after the application was filed.
 
Section 82
12.  
The Tenant alleged that the
Landlord failed to maintain the rental unit in a good state of repair as
required by section 20 of the Act.   The Tenant stated that the following
issues exist at the residential complex:  mold in his closet, water pooling at
the foot of the exterior stairs when it rains, exposed wires in the laundry
room, main door to complex in disrepair, kitchen cupboards in disrepair, stove
burners do not keep proper temperature, no screen on window (main level), and
no railing on back deck.  In support the Tenant submitted photos of the issues
into evidence.  The Tenant requested that these repairs be completed.
13.  
The Tenant also alleged that
there is so much construction debris in the backyard that the area cannot be
used.  Since there is no living room in the residential complex, the Tenant has
always relied on the yard as a common area. 
14.  
The Landlord disputed the
issues raised by the Tenant and submitted that the photos are outdated and that
a number of these issues have already been addressed.    He also submitted that
a lot of the garbage and debris in the yard belongs to either this Tenant or
WM.   He further submitted that the kitchen cupboards have been repaired
multiple times and if now are in disrepair it is due to the tenants at the
complex.   The Landlord was not opposed to addressing any outstanding issues at
the rental unit. 
15.  
Since the Landlord was not
opposed to addressing any outstanding issue at the premises, the Landlord shall
inspect and complete any necessary repairs to the issues raised by the Tenant
pursuant to section 82 of the Act.   The Landlord shall also ensure that the
backyard is usable and free of garbage and debris.
Section 83
16.  
The Tenant maintained that
he did not owe any rent to the Landlord and requested that the Landlord be
ordered to complete the necessary repairs to the complex.
17.  
The Landlord requested an
order terminating the tenancy and stated that he was not concerned about the
money owing as he just wanted this relationship to end. 
18.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
19.  
The rent arrears are
substantial and have been outstanding for a long period of time.  The Landlord
is entitled to terminate this tenancy if the rent arrears are not paid in the
standard timeframe.  If the Tenant pays the amount outstanding by the due date,
the tenancy would continue. 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before November
16, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,688.23*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to November 5, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $13.97 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
November 6, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November 16, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
November 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 16, 2018, then starting November 17, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 17, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before November
16, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,215.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after November 17, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.  
On or before November 17,
2018, the Landlord shall inspect the rental unit and complete any necessary
repairs/replacements to the following:
a)   
Closet in rental unit;
b)   
Water pooling at exterior
stairs;
c)   
Exposed wires in laundry
room;
d)   
Main door;
e)   
Kitchen cupboards;
f)    
Stove;
g)   
Screen on window, main
level; and
h)   
Back deck.
11.  
On or before November 17, 2018, the Landlord
shall also ensure that the backyard is free of garbage and debris.
