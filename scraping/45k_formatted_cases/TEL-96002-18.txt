Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006

N. H. I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict S. A. C. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and has been persistently late
paying the rent.
 
This application was heard in Cobourg on
December 4, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent, N.
L., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
There is no dispute between
the parties that the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 10,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant paid $2,000.00
after the application was filed.
3.     
The monthly lawful rent is
$1,028.10.
4.     
The arrears of rent owing
for the period ending December 31, 2018 total $2,769.08.
5.     
The Landlord incurred costs
of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those
costs.
6.     
There is also no dispute
that the Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent. Since at least
December 1, 2017 the Tenant has never paid rent on time. 
7.     
The only real dispute
between the parties is the Tenant’s request for relief pursuant to s. 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Tenant wants to remain
in the rental unit. The Landlord objects to the Tenant’s request and seeks an
eviction order.
8.     
As I stated at the hearing,
what this means is that the issue for the Board is whether or not it would be
unfair in all of the circumstances to grant the relief the Tenant seeks. 
9.     
The Tenant has lived in the
rental unit for more than five years. He is an IT professional and a single
father of two children ages 14 and 10. 
10.   The Tenant says that in August of 2018 his 14
year old daughter experienced a mental health crisis. She was hospitalised for
three weeks. The Tenant took a leave from work in September to care for her and
applied for compassionate leave benefits. The Tenant ran into financial
problems he had not anticipated in part because of the interplay between
benefits and vacation pay. He says this is why he is currently in arrears of
rent. 
11.   The Tenant says he returned to work on December
6, 2018, his employer is willing to advance him some money, and he can pay the
rent arrears owing by the Friday of the week of the hearing. 
12.   With respect to the persistent late payment
problem it is not entirely clear from his evidence why the Tenant has been
persistently late paying the rent. The Landlord’s records show that between
December 2017 and March of 2018 the Tenant was making payments towards the rent
every couple of weeks which seems to correspond with his pay periods. 
13.   Then in April he started paying once a month, a
pattern which continued until August of 2018 when payment stopped. Of the
monthly payments made between April and August, 2018, only one was enough to
cover a full month’s rent and none of the payments were on time. 
14.   The Tenant says that up until August of 2018 he
was making a concerted effort to get to the point where he can pay rent on time
and in full. In addition to his earnings the Tenant receives the child tax
credit on the 20th of each month so the Tenant should be able to
afford the rental unit. However, his evidence of earnings was somewhat vague
and he provided no evidence of his other expenses, so it remains something of a
mystery as to why the Tenant struggles to pay rent on time and in full. 
15.   The Tenant says that he feels badly for the
trouble he has caused the Landlord and is not asking for a handout. He can pay
on time. He understands that paying on time into the future is what he needs to
do to be a father to his kids. There are no comparable units that he can afford
in the area which is close to his work.
16.   The Landlord says that this is the sixth
application to the Board with respect to this tenancy in the last four years.
The Board’s records show:
(1)  In Board file TEL-43346-13 the Landlord applied
for an order based on non-payment of rent. The application was resolved by way
of a repayment plan. 
(2)  In Board file TEL-49863-14 the Landlord applied
for an order for non-payment of rent. At the hearing of that application the
Tenant raised his own issues (contained in Board file TEL-50759-14). The Tenant
was found to be in arrears of rent but was awarded abatement of one month’s
rent because of illegal entries by the Landlord that were videotaped by the
Tenant and other behaviour including written threats of bodily harm by the
Landlord. In addition to abatement, the Landlord was ordered to pay an
administrative fine of $500.00. 
(3)  In Board file TEL-54905-15 the Landlord filed a
combined application for arrears of rent and persistent late payment. After a
contested hearing the Tenant was granted relief in the form of an order that
permitted him time to catch up with the rent and then pay rent on time for a
nine month period thereafter. The order says in part:
11.  The
Tenant did not dispute the Landlord’s claim.  He stated that as a single
parent, and sole provider for 10 and 6 year old children, he has had to rely on
income received from social services and/or graphic design work when available,
which is not always received in time to pay the rent when due.  He indicated
that, if given the opportunity, he was prepared to arrange his affairs in order
to pay the rent on time going forward.
(4)  Then in Board file TEL-64454-15 the Landlord
filed an application under s. 78 of the Act for an eviction order without a
hearing based on the assertion that the Tenant breached order TEL-54905-15 by
failing to pay the rent on time in November of 2015. The Tenant then filed a
set aside motion. 
Following a
hearing of the Tenant’s motion, the Board issued order TEL-64454-15-SA in which
the Board makes a finding that the Tenant breached the previous order by
failing to pay rent on time in November and December of 2015, but grants
further relief in the form of an order requiring the Tenant to pay rent on time
throughout 2016. The order says:
2.     The
Tenant then stated that he has been able to make adjustments in his pay with
his employer and that from now the late payments will not occur.
3.     It was
explained to the Tenant that this can not keep occurring and that the Landlord
has the right to have his rent on time or to evict the tenant if this does not
occur.
4.     The
Tenant fully agreed with this statement and again assured the hearing and the
Landlord that this would not occur again.
17.   The Landlord says there is definitely a pattern
to the Tenant’s behaviour. He will make a few payments and then fall back into
arrears again. The Landlord speculates that the Tenant cannot afford the rental
unit and believes the pattern is fixed and will not change. The Landlord does
not want partial payments. 
18.   The Landlord says he has a mortgage to pay, and
although he has not defaulted on the mortgage he has had to borrow from his
personal funds to pay the expenses related to the building. In response to my
questions, the Landlord stated that the residential complex has 13 units and
the Landlord has 2 other rental properties – one has 10 units and the other 13.

19.   Neither party provided any written documentation
to corroborate their testimony.  
20.   Given the history relayed above, and the
Tenant’s lack of explanation for the persistent late payment problem prior to
his daughter’s mental health crisis in August of 2018, and having considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the
Act, I find that it would be unfair to resolve the persistent late payment
application by simply issuing another pay on time order. 
21.   The Board has granted relief in the form of two
separate conditional pay on time orders in the past and each time the Tenant
has promised to pay rent on time into the future and to rearrange his financial
affairs to ensure that happens. And yet that clearly has not worked. Under the
circumstances, the only conclusion I can come to is that for whatever reason
the Tenant does not take his obligation to pay rent on time seriously. In other
words, granting relief in the form of yet another pay on time order will likely
not change what appears to be a set pattern. As a result, an order shall issue
terminating the tenancy for persistent late payment of rent. 
22.   That being said, if the Tenant pays off the rent
arrears owing for the period ending December 31, 2018, it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2019. Given the time of year, the
presence of two children in the unit, one of whom who has just been through a
mental health crisis, the length of the tenancy, and the difficult market
conditions, it seems to me that if the arrears are paid this delay would not be
unfair in all of the circumstances. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of
$1,010.00 from the Tenant and this deposit shall be applied to the rent due for
the month of January, 2019. 
23.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from April 19, 2013 to December 31, 2018 totalling
$90.61. This amount shall be applied to first top up the deposit to the lawful
monthly rent of $1,028.18; the remainder shall be applied to the rent arrears
owing. 
24.   If the Tenant does not move out on or before
January 31, 2019, the eviction may be enforced through the Court Enforcement
Office and daily compensation shall also become due and owing for the period
starting February 1, 2019. 
25.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated for persistent late payment effective
December 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,886.65 on or before December 21, 2018. This amount represents the
amount of rent owing up to December 31, 2018 ($2,769.08), plus the fee for
filing the application ($190.00) minus a portion of the interest ($72.43) the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before December 21, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 22, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
4.     
If the Tenant fails to
comply with paragraph 2 of this order by making full payment on or before
December 21, 2018, then the Landlord may, within 30 days of the Tenant's breach
and without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of
the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant on a date
prior to January 31, 2019.
5.     
The Landlord shall apply the
Tenant’s last month’s rent deposit and the balance of the interest owing on the
deposit to the rent due for the month of January, 2019. 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2019, then starting February 1, 2019, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2019.
8.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2019, then starting February 1, 2019 the Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord $33.80 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting February 1, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
