In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 9 LATHAM
AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1N1M7


 




Between:


Etienne Jonathan De Villiers


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


David Toth


Tenant



 
 
Etienne Jonathan De Villiers
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict David Toth (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord’s legal representative Thirusenthuran
Sivapatham and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant was supported by his support worker Samantha Saerber.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
23, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 18, 2020
to September 23, 2021.
 
4.    
At the hearing the Tenant attempted to raise of number of concerns pursuant
to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the Act):
 
 
82 (1) At a hearing of an application by a landlord under section
69 for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant based on a notice
of termination under section 59, the Board shall permit
the tenant to raise any issue
that could be the subject of an
application made by the tenant under this Act if the tenant,
(a)    
complies with the requirements set out in subsection (2); or
(b)     provides an explanation satisfactory
to the Board explaining why the tenant could not comply with the requirements
set out in subsection (2)..




 
 
(2)    
The requirements referred to in subsection (1) are the following:
 
1.   The
tenant shall give advance notice to the landlord of the tenant’s intent to raise
the issue at the hearing.
2.  
The notice shall be given within
the time set out in the Rules.
3. 
The notice shall be given in writing and shall comply
with the Rules
 
5.     In accordance with section 82(2) of the Act, the Board’s Rules of Procedure
provide as follows::
 
19.4 Unless the LTB has directed
or ordered otherwise, a tenant who intends to raise
issues under sections 82(1) or 87(2) of the RTA during a hearing for a
landlord’s application about rent arrears shall provide the other parties and
the LTB with the following at least 7 days before the scheduled CMH or hearing:
 
1. a written description of each issue the tenant
intends to raise; and
2. a copy of all documents, pictures and other evidence that the tenant intends to rely
upon at the hearing.
 
6.    
The Tenant failed to comply with
the notice / disclosure requirements of Rule 19.4. As of the date of
the hearing, the Tenant had not filed with the Board or served
on the Landlord a list of issues to
be raised or any evidence to support their section 82 concerns. The Tenant was unable to provide any explanation as to why he did not comply with Rule 19.4
of the Act.
 
7.     Therefore, the Tenant
is not entitled to raise
section 82 issues
and the matter proceeded to hear the Landlord’s claim for
non-payment of rent only.
 
8.    
The Tenant
disputed the amount
owing to the Landlord
stating that he paid rent in
cash for the months of November and December 2021. The Tenants did not submit any receipt of
payment, bank records, confirmation from the Landlord that the funds were
received or any other evidence to support his assertion that he
paid the rent by cash in November and December 2021. The Landlord denies that any funds were received.
 
9.    
In Mauti v.
Gibbs, 2019 ONSC 3355 (CanLII), the Divisional Court held at paragraph 27
that while the Landlord bears the burden of proof in a rent arrears
application, it is it is difficult for a landlord to prove a negative (i.e. non-payment of rent). Therefore, “. . .while the ultimate persuasive burden
never shifts, once a landlord denies receiving funds, the tenant will have an
evidentiary burden or a chance to advance some evidence to positively prove
that he or she paid rent.”
 
10. 
On a balance of
probabilities, I find that the Tenant owes to the Landlord rent for the months of August 2021 through to January 2022. I accept the Landlord’s evidence of




 
non-payment, and as stated,
the Tenants provided
no evidence supporting that the disputed payments were made to the Landlord.
 
11. 
The Tenant
refused to propose
a repayment plan stating
that he should not owe any
rent to the Landlord, and that the Landlord should owe him money for
ongoing harassment. The Tenant was reminded that the Board would not consider
the issues intended to be raised under section 82 of the Act.
Relief from eviction:
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
13.  The Tenant is hearing impaired
and his only source of income is from ODSP. The
Tenant stated he would require at least six months to find alternate housing.
 
14.  The Tenant has not paid any rent to the Landlord in six months and made it clear at the hearing that he does not intend to pay
back the rent arrears or any rent going forward.
 
15.  I find that delaying termination to February 28, 2022
is appropriate in these circumstances. The Tenant
is granted some additional time to find alternate housing
and the delay to February 28, 2022 limits the financial prejudice to the
Landlord.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,865.32*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$6,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,186.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
