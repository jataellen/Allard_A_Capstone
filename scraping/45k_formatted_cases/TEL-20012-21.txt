Mike Mladenovski (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Karen Mccullough (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 26, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing, the Landlord said the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
7, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord’s application was filed on October 8, 2021
 
3.    
The Board does not have jurisdiction to hear the Landlord’s L1 application because
the Tenant was not in possession of the rental unit at the time the
application was filed.
 
4.    
The Landlord may file an L10 application to collect money from a former tenant within the requisite time frame if he wishes to
do so.
