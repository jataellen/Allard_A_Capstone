Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-41056-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


209, 819 TRUNK
ROAD
SAULT STE. MARIE
ON P6A3T3


 




Between:


Jonthan (jon)
  Dieks


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


2178454 Ontario Inc Stephen Edmonds


Landlords



 
 
 
Jonthan (jon) Dieks (the
'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Stephen Edmonds and 2178454
Ontario Inc (the 'Landlords') or the Landlords' superintendent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the
rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant
or by a member of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 18, 2021.
Only the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
was taken over by a new Landlord
before the application was heard. The Tenant opted not to add the new Landlord as a
party.
 
2.    
The Tenant alleged that the superintendent entered his unit illegally on May 4, 2020. The entry for repairs was agreed to
verbally when the Tenant requested repairs and the Tenant did not register any
objection with the Landlord.
 
3.     The Tenant alleged that the Landlord did not enforce a
municipal order closing all balconies to tenants
because the balconies
were not safe. Any failure
to comply is a
municipal matter and does not entitle the Tenant to a remedy from the Board.
 
4.    
The Tenant was of the view that
the superintendent did not do enough to stop other Tenants from smoking cigarettes and marijuana in the residential complex,
particularly on balconies. The Tenant started
recording other tenants
and accosting them over smoking. The superintendent asked the
Tenant to stop harassing other Tenants. This
led to a verbal altercation during which the superintendent threatened the
Tenant with eviction.




File Number: NOT-41056-20
 
The Tenant reported the incident to the Landlord’s agent and the latter told the Tenant that he would speak to the
superintendent about the matter.
 
5.     The Tenant distributed anonymous letters to other
tenants maligning the superintendent. The superintendent responded by sending the Tenant
a letter waring
him to stop trying to get him dismissed. The superintendent forwarded a copy of the
letter to the police.                                                                                                                                    The evidence shows that the Tenant was the
one harassing the superintendent and other
tenants. The Landlord’s agent
did address the issue by speaking to the superintendent and the latter responded
by having little contact with the Tenant.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant's application is dismissed.
