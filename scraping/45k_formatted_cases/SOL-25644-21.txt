Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-25644-21



In the matter
of:


153
CRANBROOK DRIVE HAMILTON ON
  L9C4S5


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christina Archambault


Tenant



 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Christina Archambault (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Katherine Howlett, attended the hearing.
As of 10:32 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from May 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 2,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased to $1,106.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $308.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.




File Number: SOL-25644-21
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,591.06*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 24, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $10.13
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,416.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$4,522.00 if the payment
is made on or
before March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
