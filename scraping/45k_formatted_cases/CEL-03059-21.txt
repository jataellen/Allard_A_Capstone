Patrick Hibbert Aldene


Tenant



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Patrick Hibbert Aldene (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Jason Paine, attended
the hearing. As of 10:30 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,270.92.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,270.92
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 1, 2020 to September 22, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-03059-21
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,275.09*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
