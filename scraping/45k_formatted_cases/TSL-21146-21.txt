Tenants




 
 
 
Morguard Nar Canada Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Ayesha Iftikhar and Awais Qadir Gondal (the 'Tenants') because they have
been persistently late in paying
their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on July 13, 2021, beginning
at 9:00 a.m..
 
Only the Landlord and the
Landlord's Legal Representative attended the hearing. As of 11:00 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at this hearing
although properly served
with a notice of the hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord seeks an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants because they have persistently failed to
pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.       
The monthly rent is $1,242.38.
 
3.       
On March 3, 2021 the Landlord
served an N8 Notice to End Your Tenancy with a
termination date of May 31, 2021.
 
4.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,242.38 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021.




 
6.       
The Landlord's Legal
Representative submits that that the Tenants have failed to pay their lawful
rent on time for the past 12 months, beginning on March 1, 2020. Additionally
the Tenants failed to pay the lawful rent due for the period of October 1, 2020
to July 1, 2021. The Landlord’s ledger was presented as evidence and supports the grounds for the
Landlord’s application.
 
7.       
The Landlord provided Rent Reminder notifications to the Tenants
on December 7, 2020;
March 19, 2021; April 8, 2021; May 5, 2021; and June 9, 2021 without receiving
any, or an adequate, response from the Tenants.
 
8.       
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of February
19, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $9,092.16, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from June 1, 2021 to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
from February 9, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before February 19, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.
