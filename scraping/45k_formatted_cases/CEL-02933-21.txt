Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
CEL-02933-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
44 PEEL STREET PENETANGUISHENE ON L9M1B7


 




Between:


Caroline Bell


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danielle Bottineau


Tenant



 
 
 
Caroline Bell (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danielle Bottineau (the
'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on January 7, 2022 at 9am.
 
Only the Landlord Caroline
Bell and their legal representative Amanda Reed attended the hearing. The tenant did not attend
despite receiving notice of the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
William Min has an agreement with the Landlord
to purchase the residential complex
on September 23, 2021 and in good faith requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.       
The Landlord has filed an affidavit sworn by the person who personally requires
the rental unit certifying
that the person in good faith requires the rental unit for his or her own
personal use.
 
3.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and
this deposit is still being held by
the Landlord.
 
4.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2019 to November 30, 2021
 
5.       
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on or before
October 31, 2021




 
6.       
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. I accept that the purchaser requires the unit for
use by December 1, 2021. The Tenant did not attend the hearing, and thus I did
not receive any evidence or submissions relevant that may have been relevant to
s. 83 from them.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of January
17, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $832.27,
which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from December 1, 2021 to
January 17, 2022, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$49.32 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 18, 2022 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
