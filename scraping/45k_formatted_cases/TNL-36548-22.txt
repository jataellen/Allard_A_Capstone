Tenant



 
 
 
On January 16, 2022, Nivlog
Investments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Arkadiusz
Wrobel (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on May 3, 2021 with respect to application TNL-27017-20.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1028.70 rent
on or before January 5, 2022.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-27017-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 8, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
