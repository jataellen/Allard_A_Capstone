Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04533-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


507 DOWNES JACKSON
HEIGHTS MILTON ON L9T8W2


 




Between:


Beryl Wu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jill Robb Terri Robb


Tenants



 
 
 
Beryl Wu (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Terri Robb and Jill Robb (the
'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January
18, 2022 with respect to
application HOL-12146-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants did not pay $10,000.00 arrears on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $16,437.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
HOL-12146-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $15,237.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
HOL-12146-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,450.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
5, 2019 to February 8, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-12146-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $13,374.87*
(less any amounts paid since this application was filed on January 26, 2022).
This amount represents the rent owing up to February 8, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$80.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting February 20, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.
