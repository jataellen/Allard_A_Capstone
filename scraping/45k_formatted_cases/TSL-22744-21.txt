Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-22744-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


20, 2 SUPERIOR AVENUE TORONTO ON M8V2M3


 




Between:


Mayer Investments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joseph Nixon


Tenant



 
 
 
Mayer Investments Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Joseph Nixon (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin attended the hearing. As of 9:42 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 24,
2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,890,70.
 
4.     
The Tenant paid $750.00
after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord sent a
letter to the Tenant on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.     
The Landlord
also informed the Tenant about the hearing.
 
7.     
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
8.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to




 
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenant
has not paid a full months’ rent since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $15,535.10*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 11, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $62.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 22, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January 23, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $16,860.70** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
