Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TSL-24171-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


0102, 31 ST. DENNIS DRIVE NORTH YORK ON M3C1G7


 




Between:


Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alexandra Holubova
  Julius Holub
Tomas
Holub Jr.


Tenants



 
 
Starlight Canadian Residential Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Julius Holub, Tomas
Holub Jr. and Alexandra Holubova
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris,
attended the hearing.
As of 2:18 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
August 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,434.13 as of January
1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,464.46 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the
rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January 1,
2021 to January 14, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenants
paid $1,487.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the




 
Tenant, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $5,026.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 14, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $47.15 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 25, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January 26, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 26, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 25, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,452.60** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
