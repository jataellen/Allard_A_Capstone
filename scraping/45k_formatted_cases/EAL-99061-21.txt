Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99061-21
 



In the matter
of:


2202, 1150 FISHER AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1Z8M6


 




Between:


Homestead Land
Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andrew McCaulay
  Rachel Nott


Tenants



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andrew McCaulay
and Rachel Nott (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Megan O’Conner, attended the hearing. As
of 3:32 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from November 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,675.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,675.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from May 1, 2021 to
December 2, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $5,025.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 1, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 1, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $354.97*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $55.07 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenants
move out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 1, 2022,
then starting April 2, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 2, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,796.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$5,146.00 if the payment
is made on or before April 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenants may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after April 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
