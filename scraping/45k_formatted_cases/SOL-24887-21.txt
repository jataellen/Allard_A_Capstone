In the
  matter of:


3, 5703 DESSON AVENUE NIAGARA FALLS ON L2G3T3


 




Between:


11930907 Canada
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie Leskiw


Tenant



 
 
 
11930907 Canada Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Leskiw (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 25, 2022. Only the Landlord,
Xueyong Sun, attended the hearing. As of 10:24 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 15, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $950.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $950.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 24, 2020 to September 15, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,858.81*, which
represents the amount
of rent owing and
compensation up to January 31, 2022,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$31.23 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 11, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$14,436.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)         
$15,386.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 12, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
