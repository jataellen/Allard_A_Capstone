Amended Order
Order under Section
135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act
 
File Number: SOT-11672-19
SOT-10292-19
 
 
This amended order is issued
to correct a clerical error in the original order issued
January 12, 2022.
 
AK (the 'Tenant’) applied for an
order determining that AN (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money
illegally (the “T1 application”). The Tenant also applied for an order
determining the Landlord
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a
member of their household (The “T2 application”).
 
These applications were heard
together by video
conference December 22, 2021.
 
The Tenant attended the hearing
with her representative Tim Kelly. The Landlord did not attend the hearing despite being properly
notified by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Illegal Lockout
 
1.     The Tenant alleges
the Landlord illegally locked the Tenant
out of the unit and unilaterally
terminated the tenancy. The alleged lockout occurred on December 03, 2018.
Under s. 29(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), a
Tenant must make an application to the Board within one year of the impugned
conduct. In this case, the Tenant filed their application on December 02, 2018,
which is within the statutory limitation period.
 
2.     On October 20, 2021
the Tenant’s review request was granted, and a new hearing was ordered. This is that hearing.




 
3.    
On December 03, 2018 the Tenant
came home to find the locks were changed. She no longer had access to the unit.
The police were called the Landlord was advised to allow the Tenant
to re-enter the unit. The Landlord refused.
The Tenant went a friend’s
house.
 
4.    
The following day the Tenant returned
with a police escort to pick up her belongings. The Landlord, again, refused the Tenant entry.
 
5.     On December 05, 2018 a moving truck showed up, where
the Tenant was staying, with some of the Tenant’s belongings. Not all the Tenant’s belongings were there and some of the Tenant’s belongings were damaged.
 
6.     The Landlord did not obtain an order from the Board terminating the tenancy, the parties
did not agree to terminate the tenancy, and the Tenant did not give notice to
terminate then vacate the unit voluntarily. I therefore find that the Landlord
illegally changed the lock to the residential complex on December 3, 2018.
 
Remedies
 
7.     Section 31(1)(b) of the Act allows the Board to order
a landlord to pay reasonable costs that the tenant
has incurred or will incur repairing or replacing property that was damaged as a result of an illegal lockout. The Board may also order other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the tenant
has incurred or will incur as a result of the breach. Finally, s. 31(2) allows
the Board to order a landlord to pay a portion of increased rent, as well as
out-of-pocket moving, storage, and “other like expenses” that the tenant has
incurred or will incur due to the illegal lockout.
 
8.     The Tenant paid rent for the month of December 2018.
The Tenant was locked out of
the unit December 03, 2018. The
Tenant is entitled to an abatement to reflect the period of time for which
she did not have possession of the unit despite having paid for it.
Accordingly, I order an abatement in the amount of $621.94.
 
9.     The Tenant provided
the Landlord with a
rent deposit in the amount of one month’s rent. I find she is entitled to a return
of that deposit in the amount in the amount of $600 plus interest owing on the
deposit, calculated as follows:
 



2018


1.8% (27 days)


$0.80




2019


1.8%


$10.80




2020


2.2%


$13.20




2021


1.5%


$9.00




2022


1.2% (31 days)


$0.60



 
The Total owing the Tenant under this paragraph
is $634.40




 
 
 
10.  The Tenant submitted a detailed accounting of items
that were damaged by the movers or not returned
to her. She did not have receipts, but I find that it is not unusual
for people to keep receipts of
all the items that they purchase. I find the following items were lost or
damaged as a result of the Landlord’s breach, and also that the amount claimed
by the Tenant accurately reflects the reasonable cost that the Tenant has
incurred or will incur repairing or replacing the items:
 



Kitchenware items


$530.82




Computer Tablet


$148.72




128 microSD Data

$67.99

The total owing the Tenant under this section
is $14,115.93
 
 
11.  The Tenant also claimed $28.21 for moving expenses.
This includes $5.64 for packing tape and $22.57
for boxes. I find these
expenses to be reasonable and the Tenant
shall be reimbursed accordingly.
 
12.  The Tenant claimed additional expenses related to a
lost academic semester. The Tenant did not provide any testimony on why she lost a whole semester
when the illegal lockout occurred in December 03,
2018. The Tenant did miss one exam but did not provide any indication that she
contacted the school to make up the exam. In these circumstances I do not find it appropriate to award the Tenant expenses
related to a lost
academic semester.
 
13.  The Tenant claimed expenses for traveling to and from
school. The Tenant testified she moved back home to her parents. This resulted in her having
to be driven over 110 Km to and from school each day. The Tenant did not offer any evidence that
she found, or attempted to find, a new place to live closer to the school.
Since the Tenant moved back home with parents, she no longer had to pay rent.
The higher cost of travel would be offset by the rent the Tenant no longer had
to pay. For these reasons, I decline to award the Tenant any travel related
expenses for school.
 
14.    The Tenant requested hearing costs. LTB Interpretation Guideline Three advises
that costs are generally only awarded in cases of unreasonable conduct within
the proceeding—such as unnecessarily delaying the hearing. While the Tenant’s application was successful, and the
Landlord’s conduct as a landlord was certainly questionable,
there is no evidence
before me that the Landlord’s conduct was unreasonable in the context of
this proceeding. I find there was no unreasonable conduct that warrants
awarding any costs, other than the application fee.





It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
the sum of $1255.80. This amount represents
$634.40 and $621.40 for the Tenant’s
rental deposit with interest as well as an abatement of rent to reflect the period
of time the Tenant paid for the unit but did not have use of it.
 
2.    
The Landlord shall also pay the Tenant $14,115.93, reflecting the
reasonable costs that the Tenant will incur or has incurred
to replace or repair her items that were damaged
or lost as a result of the Landlord’s illegal lockout.
 
3.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $50.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.     The total amount
the Landlord owes to the Tenant
is $15,421.73
 
5.    
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by January 31, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 01, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
6.     The Tenant has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
