  L1A1P1


 




Between:

Landlords




 


and


 




 


Evangelos
  Skoplianos


Tenant



 
David Bray (DB) and Joshua Bickle
(JB) (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Evangelos Skoplianos (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord (JB) and the Landlord's Legal Representative
Steven Smith attended the hearing.
 
As of 10:27 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
is a six (6) unit apartment building.
 
2.     The Landlord alleges
that during the annual fire inspection of the residential complex on April 27,
2021 it was discovered that the Tenant removed the unit smoke detectors and
that behaviour of deliberately disabling the unit smoke detectors contravenes
the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, and the Tenants action constitutes an
illegal act and seriously impairs the safety to the other occupants of the
residential complex.
 
3.     On August 12, 2021 the Landlord filed
an application to end the tenancy
and evict the Tenants based on a N6 and a N7 notice
of termination given to the Tenants.
 
4.     The termination date set out in the notices given was August
12, 2021.
 
5.     The Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit pursuant to the notices
given.




 
6.    
The issue to be determined in this case -
has the Tenant committed an illegal
act in the rental unit or the residential complex, and if so, was the
act to be considered serious enough to warrant eviction of the Tenant.
 
7.     Subsection 61(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act (the RTA) provides:
 
61.(1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit
commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation
or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
8.     The term "illegal" is not defined
in the RTA but would include a serious violation
of a federal, provincial or
municipal law.
 
9.     Section 75 of the RTA provides that the Board may
evict a tenant for an illegal act whether or not the tenant or other person has been
convicted of an offence relating
to the illegal act.
 
10.  Section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides:
 
(1) A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if, (a) an act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
a person permitted
in the residential complex by the tenant seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and (b) the act or omission occurs in the residential
complex.
 
11.  Section 66 is intended to be used only where the misconduct is serious in nature. The Act
specifically uses the adjective “seriously” for a reason, the use of that word
means the provision is not intended to cover any potential, contingent, or
theoretical risk of harm.
 
12.  Since this is the Landlord’s application, the Landlord
bears the burden
of proving the allegations on a balance of
probabilities.
 
13. 
The standard
of proof requires
that evidence “must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy
the balance of probabilities test.”
 
14.  The Tenant did not attend
to make submissions.
 
15. 
Based on the uncontested testimony of the Landlord, on a balance
of probabilities, I find
that by deliberately tampering with and disabling the unit smoke detectors in
the rental unit the Tenant has seriously impaired and seriously impairs the safety of other persons and is an illegal act and this act or omission
occurred in the residential complex.
 
16.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
17. 
Subject to clause 83 (1) (b), the Board shall, in an order based on a notice
given under section 61(1) and
section 66, request that the sheriff expedite the enforcement of the order.
 
18.  In this case, I grant
expedited enforcement on this order.
 
19.  The order shall request
the Sheriff to expedite the enforcement of the order.
 
20. 
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord and shall be applied to the last
month of the tenancy.
 
21. 
The order
contains all the reasons for the decision
within the order.
No other reasons will be issued.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of October
31, 2021.
 
2.     If the unit was not vacated on or before October 31,
2021, then starting November 1, 2021, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after November 1, 2021. The
Sheriff is requested to
expedite the enforcement of this order.
