Tenants



 
 
 
 
Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Emily
White and Richard
Gehring (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration
charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 26, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative,
Sharon Harris attended the hearing. As of 10:00 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,058.63.
 
4.     The application is amended to reflect that the
Landlord incurred charges of $5.00 for a cheque tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenants, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for
related administration charges.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,033.68
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




 
 
 
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 24, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $2,058.63 after the application was filed.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,639.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022 and the total charges related to
an NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $34.80
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $4,504.15** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
