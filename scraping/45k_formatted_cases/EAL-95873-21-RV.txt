Review Order
 
 
Mohammad Alam (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashtine Cote and Aaron White (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was resolved
by order EAL-95873-21 issued on August 17, 2021.
 
On August 25, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review of the order
and that the order be stayed
until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On September 1, 2021, interim
order EAL-95873-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order. The request was
heard by videoconference on December 7, 2021.
The Landlord’s representative, D. Sabourin, and one the Tenants, Aaron White, attended
the hearing,
.
Determinations:
 
1.     I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred
in the proceedings.
 
2.     The Tenants alleged that they did not have a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the proceedings because received the
Notice of Hearing for the August 4, 2021 hearing from the Landlord’s
representative. They subsequently
received another Notice of Hearing from the Board for August 11, 2021. The Tenants
claimed that they have little experience




File Number: EAL-95873-21
 
with Board proceedings, so they decided
to attend the August 11, 20211 hearing
instead of August 4 and found that that the application had been
withdrawn.
 
3.     The Tenant’s evidence
is not credible. The Board
serves Notices of Hearing. In this case it
was done by mail (June 21, 2021 for August
11 and June 29 for August 4). None of the
notices were returned to the Board. If
the Tenants believed the hearing had been rescheduled, they would have attended
the August 4 hearing instead of the August 11 hearing. Contrary to the Tenants’ assertion, they have previous
experience with Board proceedings. Furthermore,
the Notices of Hearing had two different file numbers so the Tenant could have
clarified any confusion by contacting the Board or the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order EAL-95873-21 issued on August 17, 2021, is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on September 1, 2021, is cancelled. The stay of order EAL- 95873-21 is lifted immediately
