Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97909-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


705, 2900 CARLING
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2B7J6


 




Between:


Starlight Can Residential Growth
Fund 2


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Bushra M Pur


Tenant



 
 
 
Starlight Can Residential Growth
Fund 2 (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bushra M Pur (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Victoria Orlandi, attended the hearing. As of 3:35 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,331.47.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,330.17 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $5,486.64 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $32.34*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant: $43.77 per
day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 14, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $2,688.18** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 14, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
