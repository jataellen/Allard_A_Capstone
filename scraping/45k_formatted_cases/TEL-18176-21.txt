Order under Section 68
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TEL-18176-21
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 52 JANET
BOULEVARD SCARBOROUGH ON M1R1H6


 




Between:


Heng Wu


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Parmod Malik


Tenant



 
Heng Wu (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Parmod Malik (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 2:45 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although sent a notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord filed an application with the Board on July
19, 2021 to end the tenancy and evict the Tenant from the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit when the application was filed.
 
3.     The Landlord testified that the Tenant moved
out and vacated the rental
unit as of October 15, 2021.
 
4.     The only remedy sought by the Landlord in this
Application was termination of the tenancy, the Landlord’s application to end the tenancy
and evict the tenant
is therefore moot.
It is
ordered that:
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed as moot.
