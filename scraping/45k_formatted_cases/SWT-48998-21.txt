  matter of:


211, 85 FIDDLERS GREEN ROAD W LONDON ON N6H4S9


 




Between:


Korhan Canoglu


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Capreit


Landlord



 
 
 
Korhan Canoglu
(the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Capreit (the 'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance
obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or
failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 25, 2021.
 
The Tenant
and the Landlord’s Legal Representative Dragana Orelj attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant filed this
application about maintenance on February 3, 2021. Therefore, only those issues
that go back 12 months
from date of application may be considered, unless they are ongoing
issues. Specifically, the Tenant
alleged:
 
a.   
The Landlord
failed to complete
the repairs to the ceiling
from a water leak in the
kitchen from July 2019, and
 
b.   
The Landlord
failed to complete
repairs from a water leak from December
2020 in the bathroom and
master bedroom.
 
2.    
It was uncontested that
there were leaks as reported, and that the leaks were resolved when reported,
however the repairs,
patching and painting
of the gyprock that had been
damaged or removed was not completed until May 2021.
 
3.    
The Representative
explained that the Landlord had adopted a COVID emergency work policy in March 2020. I was not convinced
that this was a reasonable excuse not to have
ensure the work was completed under COVID PPE safety protocols in a more timely
manner.




 
4.    
There was testimony
regarding reporting of the issues using the residence portal, however I gave
this no weight. The Landlord aught to
have known from their own contractors that the work was incomplete, and not waited for Tenant
complaints to finally complete the repairs.
 
5.    
I was satisfied by the
uncontested evidence that the Landlord did not complete the repairs until
May 2021. Therefore, I find that the Landlord
failed to meet the Landlord's obligations under subsection
20(1) repair the rental unit in a timely manner.
 
6.    
The Tenant seeks an abatement of rent of 25% for the period that the ceiling repairs,
and the repairs in the bathroom and master bedroom.
 
7.    
The Landlords
representative indicated that these were more aesthetic work, and although the Tenant had cats they could not get into the ceilings.
They might have completed sooner if there were other
reasons.
 
8.    
Here, the Landlord was
made aware in July 2019 of the water leak and did not complete the repairs
finally until May 2021. Further, a second leak in December 2020 was not finally
repaired until May 2021. In so doing,
the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act. That
said, I am not persuaded, on the totality of the evidence that this was
anything but a cosmetic issue. The
Landlord opened up the ceiling to effect repairs for the water leak, and then
either lost track or failed to follow up prior to COVID for the kitchen repair,
and then delayed similar work on basis it was not an emergency. This does not relieve the Landlord of
their obligations under the Act. Based
upon the evidence before me and my knowledge of similar cases before the Board,
I find that an abatement of rent is appropriate. I find that the failure of the
Landlord to address these issues or clearly establish a repair schedule for the
Tenant caused some degree of distress to the Tenant from this uncertainty. Therefore, I find that a rent abatement of 15% is appropriate in this
case. (February 2020 to May 2021 15
months X $960.00 X 15% = $2,160.00.).
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $2,160.00.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay the Tenant
$48.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.      
The total amount the Landlord owes the Tenant
is $2,208.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 17, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 17, 2022 the Landlord will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.




 
6.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant
the full amount
owing by January
31, 2022, the Tenant may recover this amount by
deducting $500.00 from the rent each month from February 2022 to May 2022 and
$208.00 in June 2022.
 
7.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
