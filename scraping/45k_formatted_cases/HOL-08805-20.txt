Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Gino D Simonds Jessica Rego


Tenants



 
 
 
Saminder Kaur Judge, Taranjit
Singh Judge and Harjinder Singh Judge (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica
Rego and Gino D Simonds
(the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Deepinder Loomba, attended the hearing. As of 1:41 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to November
30, 2020. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 31, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on January
21, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $2,140.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,140.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2019 to October 31, 2020.




File Number: HOL-08805-20
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
21, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $26,087.08*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 21, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
