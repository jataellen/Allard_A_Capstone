of:


LOWER, 198 SHERIDAN STREET BRANTFORD ON N3S4P8


 




Between:


Leonard Brak


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Ladd
  Sid Phillips


Tenants



 
 
 
Leonard Brak (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher Ladd and Sid Phillips (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord intends to do major repairs or renovations to
the rental unit.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s Notice of
Termination (the ‘N13’) alleges he needs possession of the rental unit to do repairs that are so extensive that the rental
unit needs to be vacant to do
the work.
 
2.     The N13 has a termination date of October
01, 2021.
 
3.    
Section 50(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”) requires the termination date in an notice of
termination N13 to be the day the period of a tenancy ends The Landlord
testified that the period of the tenancy ends on the last day of the month.
Accordingly, I find the N13 to be invalid.
 
4.    
Moreover, the Landlord has not complied with s.
55.1 of the Act, which dictates that compensation required under s. 54
must be paid to the Tenant no later than on the termination date specified in
the N13 given by the Landlord.
 
5.     Based on the foregoing, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SOL-26194-21
 
 
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
