Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25153-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


146 GLENDALE AVENUE
N HAMILTON ON L8L7J8


 




Between:


Cacoeli Living
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Damian
  Zietkiewicz


Tenant



 
 
 
Cacoeli Living Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Damian Zietkiewicz (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Lisa Nadon, attended
the hearing. As of 1:56 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective October 3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 9, 2021 to October 3, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25153-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,520.63*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$7,486.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$8,986.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
