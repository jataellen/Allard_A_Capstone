Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-52664-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


259 PARK ROW WOODSTOCK ON N4S1V9


 




Between:


Chris Allcock


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Larry Kalybaba


Tenant



 
 
 
Chris Allcock
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Larry Kalybaba
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference
on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 10:18 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented although
properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlord has entered into an agreement
of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the
purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The termination date in the notice is July 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord submitted that the Tenant vacated the
unit on July 31, 2021. As the Tenant has vacated the unit, there is no need to
consider the merits of the Landlord’s application to evict the Tenant. The
Landlord’s application is moot.
 
3.     The Landlord requested an order for the application
filing fee. The Landlord’s request is denied. Pursuant to Interpretation
Guideline 3, the application filing fee will not usually be ordered for
applications to evict a tenant based on a no-fault ground (e.g. a landlord
application for termination of the tenancy for the landlord’s own use). The
application to evict the Tenant
was based on a no-fault
ground. I find no reason
to award the application
filing fee in these circumstances.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
