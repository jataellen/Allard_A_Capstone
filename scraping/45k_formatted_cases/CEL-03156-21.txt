Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03156-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER LEVEL,
14 CHAMBERS COURT BRAMPTON ON L6Z1J1


 




Between:


Jasvinder Sidhu


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Roderick Bristol


Tenant



 
 
Jasvinder Sidhu (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Roderick Bristol (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the “L1
application”). The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict the Tenant because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date. (the ‘L2’ application)
 
These applications were heard by video conference January 6, 2022.
 
The Landlord was represented at the hearing
by his paralegal Yuvraj Buhllar.
 
The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with the notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     At the hearing
the Landlord’s representative requested the Board’s consent
to withdraw the L2
application, which consent was given.
 
2.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
30, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,500.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 9, 2017 to August 30, 2021.




 
5.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did not attend the hearing
and so I did not have the opportunity to hear from them regarding any
circumstances that might be relevant to my determination under s. 83. The amount of arrears in this case are
significant – so much so that it suggests that the tenancy is not viable.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 04, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,575.01*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $49.32
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 04, 2022, then starting February 05, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 05, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 04, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $9,636.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay
the amount required under that subsection on or after February 05, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
