Order under Sections 69, 57 & 30
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-77442-17
TET-77790-17
 










 
 

Landlord’s
L1 application.
M.D. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.L. (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Tenant’s
T5 application.
The
'Tenants' applied for an order determining that the 'Landlord', gave a notice
of termination in bad faith.
 
Tenant’s
T6 application.
The
'Tenants' also applied for an order determining that the 'Landlord' failed to
meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or
maintenance standards.
 
These
applications were heard in Peterborough on April 27, 2017.
 
The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 29, 2017.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,250.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2014 to
January 29, 2017.
4.      With
respect to issues raised under Section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
both parties agreed that the Landlord collected a $500.00 security deposit at
the start of the tenancy along with the last month’s rental deposit.
5.      As
this is prohibited by the Residential Tenancies Act, this money will be
returned to the Tenant in this application.
6.      It
also became apparent at the hearing that the Landlord has been away from the
country for the past year. While he claims to have left numbers to get a hold
of him in Poland it is very clear that the Tenant has had to be responsible for
the condition and repairs of this rental unit and he should not have to do so.
7.      The
items that were repaired at the Tenant’s cost will be returned in the section
T6 however I find this so irresponsible on behalf of the Landlord I have also
awarded a further 5% rental abatement for a cost of 5% x 12 months x $1,250.00
= $750.00.
8.      The
Landlord should feel lucky that I did not also award a fine against him for
these actions.
9.      With
respect to the Tenant’s T5 application, as this
portion of the Residential Tenancies Act only applies to former tenants
and as the Tenant is still in possession, I have dismissed this portion of the
application as it is premature.
10.   With
respect to the Tenant’s T6 application, the
Tenant raised a number of problems that he encountered in the rental unit.
11.   Unfortunately
a number of them occurred more than 1 year prior to the application and I am
prohibited by law to award these amounts.
12.   There
was a problem with the water heater which cost $250.00 to repair, a further
problem where the furnace was red tagged and needed repairs at a cost of
$152.55, $321.92 in back yard repairs and replacement of the dryer at a cost of
$125.00.
13.   Receipts
were presented at the hearing to justify these amounts.
14.   These
items add up to $849.47 plus the security deposit of $500.00 plus the rental
abatement of $750.00 add up to a return of $2,099.47.
15.   This
amount will be used as a credit against outstanding arrears.
16.   The
Tenant also paid $1,100.00 after the application was filed.
17.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until May 20, 2017
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
18.   The
reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons used in making my
decision. 
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before May 20, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,043.16*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 9, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount of the {abatement/rebate}
the Landlord owes the Tenant.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $41.10 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 10, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May
20, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 21, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 20, 2017, then starting May 21, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 21, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before May 20, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,475.53** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 21, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
