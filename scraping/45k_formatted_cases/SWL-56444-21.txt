Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56444-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


B, 758 BLEAMS ROAD KITCHENER ON N2E2E6


 




Between:


Helena Ball


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Juanita
Tomarelli (Tomerelli)
  Sherrie Gosse


Tenants



 
 
Helena Ball (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sherrie
Gosse and Juanita Tomarelli (Tomerelli) (the 'Tenants') because the
Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit
and the purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This hearing
was held by videoconference on December 20, 2021. The Landlord was not present at the hearing; however her
representative, Jordan Nieuhof, attended the hearing. As of 2:26 pm the Tenants were not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 31, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenants with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a
termination date of October 31, 2021. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground
that the purchaser of the rental
unit requires the unit for residential
occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord
applied to the Board to terminate this tenancy on September 22, 2021. The Landlord has not, within two years
prior to filing this application, given any other notice under section 48, 49 or 50 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
in respect of the same or a
different rental unit.
 
Good faith
 
3.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section 49 of the Act. Section 49(1) requires that, in order to be successful in this
application, the Landlord must establish that at the time of the service of the N12, the purchaser, in good faith, required the unit for residential use.




 
4.    
In Feeney v. Noble, 1994
CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine
intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal.
This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where
the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that the Landlord
sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have
additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
5.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the motives of the Landlord are, per Salter,
“largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of the
Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.”
 
6.    
The Landlord’s
representative submitted that the purchaser, Paul Mauer, will be moving into
unit B at 758 Bleams Road in Kitchener for his own residential occupation. The Landlord provided a signed declaration
from the purchaser dated August 14, 2021, pursuant to s. 71.1 of the Act. In the declaration the purchaser states
that he requires the rental
unit, in good faith, for his primary residence when the purchase is complete on
December 1, 2021.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s representative also submitted
that the Agreement
of Purchase and Sale
for the rental unit, signed September 2, 2021, remains active and in force
despite the original completion date of December 1, 2021 having already passed.
 
8.    
On the basis of the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am satisfied
that the purchaser genuinely intends to use the
rental unit for his own primary residence. I
find that the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
Compensation
 
9.    
Section 49.1 of the Act requires
a landlord to compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s
rent if the purchaser, in good faith,
requires the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. Section 55.1 of the Act requires this
compensation to be paid no later than on
the termination date specified in the notice
of termination of the tenancy. In addition, subsection 83(4) of the Act
provides that no eviction order shall be issued in a proceeding regarding
a termination of a tenancy
for the purpose
of residential occupation unless the landlord has
complied with section 49.1 of the Act.
 
10.  The Landlord’s representative submitted that the Landlord waived the requirement for the Tenants to
pay rent of $1456.00 for the month of August 2021. The Landlord’s representative noted that the Landlord did not
receive, nor did she expect, rent from the Tenants for the month of August
2021.
 
11.  The Landlord’s representative added that
the Tenants have not paid the Landlord rent from September 1, 2021 to the date of this hearing. He acknowledged
that the Landlord retains a rent deposit from the Tenants for the sum of
$1425.00 that was collected on November 15, 2018.




 
12.  I am satisfied that the Landlord
met her obligation to pay the Tenants
compensation equal to one month’s rent in accordance with section 49.1
of the Act.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
13. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
14.  The Tenants were not present at the hearing
to provide testimony or documentary evidence
in support of any relief
from eviction. The Landlord’s representative was not aware of any Tenant
circumstances that should be
considered to provide the Tenants with any relief from eviction.
 
15. 
In this matter, I find that it would be unfair to the Landlord to further delay the completion of the Agreement of Purchase
and Sale by granting the Tenants relief from eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated on January 13, 2022.
The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2036.24, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to January 13, 2022, less the rent deposit of
$1425.00 and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
of $81.14.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $47.87
per day for compensation for the
use of the unit from January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out
of the unit.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 24, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting
January 25, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
 
 
 
January 13, 2022
