Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19376-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


0504, 222 NONQUON
ROAD OSHAWA ON L1G3S6


 




Between:


Bedford Properties &
Estates Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daryl Neal


Tenant



 
 
 
Bedford Properties & Estates Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daryl Neal (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris,
attended the hearing.
As of 1:53 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,771.00 as of January
1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $1,104.08 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord sent
letters to the Tenant on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The Landlord’s
attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit has been paid to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.
 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenant
has not paid a full month’s rent since the application
was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $5,671.57*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $58.22 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 18, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January 19, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 19, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,971.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be
terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
