IMH Pool XX LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shianne Hunter and Kaisha Welsh (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The
Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris and
the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,875.00.
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00 for a cheque tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenants, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,875.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1, 2021 to
September 24, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $1,874.00 after the application was
filed. The Tenants paid an additional $937.00
not accounted for in the update sheet and therefore the revised amount
owing is: $5,838.50.
 
8.     After I made my determinations with respect to the contested amount owing as noted
above, the parties consented to the payment plan set out below:
 
 
It is
ordered that:
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,838.50, which represents the arrears of rent
$5,652.50, and costs $186.00
outstanding for the period ending January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a)   The
Tenants shall make the following
payments to the Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of
this order:

the first day of each corresponding month.
3.    
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph
2, and by the dates required, then:
(a)   The
Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.




 
(b)   The
balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
