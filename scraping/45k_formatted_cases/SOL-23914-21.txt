Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23914-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2316 NEW STREET BURLINGTON ON L7R1J5


 




Between:


Patricia Bakko Apangu Deruth Apangu


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Marti Suzanne Neal Ronald Lawrence Deppner


Tenants



 
 
 
Patricia Bakko Apangu and Deruth Apangu (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ronald Lawrence Deppner and
Marti Suzanne Neal (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe, and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlords or another tenant; and because they or another occupant of the rental
unit have committed an illegal act or have carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal
trade, business or occupation
in the rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on November
10, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord
Deruth Apangu, the Landlord Representative Denise Ranger and the Landlord witness Andrew Choubeta attended
the hearing. The Tenant
did not attend
the hearing, although properly served with notice of
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
At the hearing, the Landlords advised
that they sought to amend
their L1 Application, which I granted in
accordance with Rule 15 of the LTB Rules of Procedure.
 
2.    
The total monthly rent is $2700.00.
 
3.    
The Lease commencement date was October
15, 2020 and the Tenants
took possession of the rental
unit on that date.




 
4.    
By way of background,
on October 11, 2020, the Tenants provided the Landlords’ realtor with two
deposit cheques as required under the Agreement to Lease (the “Lease”). The first deposit cheque was for half of
the first month’s rent and the second deposit cheque was for the last month’s
rent.
 
5.    
On October 19, 2020,
shortly after the Tenants took possession of the rental unit, it was discovered
that the Tenants’ last month rent deposit cheque in the amount of $2700.00 was
returned NSF. The Landlords were
never given a replacement cheque.
 
6.    
Subsequently,
post-dated cheques given by the Tenants for November 2020, December 2020, January
2021, and February
2021 were all returned NSF. The Landlords
were also never given
replacement cheques for these months.
 
7.    
In the end, there have
been no rent payments made by the Tenants for the period of November 1, 2020 to
the date of the hearing of this application and the Tenants have been
non-responsive to the Landlords’ communications.
 
8.    
The total amount owing
for rent by the Tenants to the Landlords currently exceeds the Board’s
jurisdictional limit of $35,000.00, with the balance being waived by the
Landlords on this application.
 
L2 Application
 
9.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a Form N6 and a Form N5.
 
10.  Section 61(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) allows a Landlord to serve a notice of
termination for an illegal act
committed or permitted by a tenant, so long as the illegal act takes place in
the unit or residential complex.  The
Landlords allege the illegal act of theft was committed by the Tenants as per
s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code of
Canada which provides: ”Every one who, by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false
pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person,
whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable
security or any service…”
 
11.  Section 64(1) of the Act also allows
a Landlord to serve a notice of termination if the conduct of the Tenant
substantially interferes with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and/or lawful
rights, privileges, or interests.
 
12.  The Landlords allege the Tenants acted in bad faith,
and illegally, by providing cheques to
the Landlords’ representatives prior to moving into the rental unit that they
knew could not be cashed. This was
done, according to the Landlord, for the purpose of taking possession of the
rental unit through means of fraud.
 
13.  The Landlords also allege that the Tenants
failed to provide proof of insurance and failed to move the utilities into
their own name prior to occupancy, contrary to a condition in Schedule A of the Lease.  The Landlord states
he was falsely advised by the Tenant




 
Ronald Deppner
on October 14, 2020 – one day prior to occupancy – that the utilities
were transferred into the Tenants’ names.
 
14.  The Tenants have still not provided proof
of insurance or transferred utilities into their own names. Consequently,
this failure has resulted in the Landlords incurring significant out-of-pocket
costs for utilities.
 
15.  The Tenants have not paid one full month of
rent since the commencement of the Tenancy in October 2020, nor have they
offered an explanation to the Landlords for their rendering of consecutive NSF
cheques.
 
16.  I accept the Landlord’s uncontradicted
evidence that the Tenants acted in bad faith in their dealings with the Landlords and I find on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenants substantially interfered with the Landlords’
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit and lawful rights, privileges, or
interests by (i) their failure to provide proof of insurance; (ii) by their
failure to transfer the utilities into their names; and, (iii) by their failure
to act in good faith by providing cheques that they knew could not be cashed.
 
17.  With respect to the Landlords’ Form N6,
however, I do not find that the Landlords have satisfied the required statutory
elements of Section 61(1) of the Act which require the “illegal act” to
have been committed or permitted in the unit or residential complex.
 
 
Section 83
 
18.  Section 83 requires
that I consider all the circumstances, including
the Tenants and the Landlords situations to determine if it would be appropriate to grant section 83 relief from eviction. There are significant arrears which exceed
the jurisdiction of the Board and thus any further delay in eviction is
prejudicial to the Landlords. The
Tenants did not attend the hearing, and thus did not provide any evidence that
may be relevant to my determination under s. 83. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act,
and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $35,000.00, which represents the maximum
jurisdictional amount for rent owing and compensation.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $88.77
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.




 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
 
i)              
$40,892.50 if the payment
is made on or before
January 14, 2022, or
ii)             
$40,892.50 if the payment
is made on or before
January 22, 2022**.
 
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
L2 Application
 
In the event the Tenants void the
order as set out above, I find as follows:
 
1.    the tenancy between the Landlords and the
Tenants is terminated on January 22, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
2.   
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.   
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlords, on or after January 23, 2022.
