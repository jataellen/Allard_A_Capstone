Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-95556-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


106, 1325 THIRD
STREET E CORNWALL ON K6H2G6


 




Between:


Torbill Holdings Ltd.


Landlord




 


,
and


 




 


Daniel Joseph


Tenant



 
 
Torbill Holdings
Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Daniel Joseph (the 'Tenant') The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 1, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Tania
Wannamaker, attended the hearing. As of 11:39 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $700.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
2.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 4, 2018 to May
21, 2021
 
3.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Landlord submitted that the Tenant bangs on the ceiling, screams
and swears at all hours of the night. The Landlord further reported that the
Tenant intimidates staff by screaming and using foul language. Neighbouring tenants
and the superintendent feel unsafe in the residential complex due to the
Tenant’s behaviour. Based on the uncontested evidence provided by the Landlord,
I find that the Tenant interfered with other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of the property. I have no reason to deny
the eviction requested by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: EAL-95556-21
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 5, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,125.34, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from May 22, 2021 to January
25, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$23.51 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from January 26, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
