Landlord’s
L1 application.
C.L.P.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.D.M.
and J.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s
L2 application.
C.L.P.
(the 'Landlord') also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.D.M.
and J.B. (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying
their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These
applications were heard in Whitby on March 26, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representative G.P. attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 24, 2018.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,356.24 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1,
2017 to January 24, 2018.
4.      The
Tenants paid $1,380.00 after the application was filed.
5.      The
rent has increased to $1,376.28 as of April 1, 2018 and is reflected in this
order.
6.      There
was a cost of $80.16 for past arrears caused by TEL-77295-17 which was an above
guidelines order granted to the Landlord. This sum is also incorporated in this
order.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
8.      With
respect to the Landlord’s L2 application, the Tenants have paid
their rent late in a persistently late manner over the past 12 months.
 
9.      The
Landlord has issued multiple N4 notices to show that this is not acceptable but
the problem continues.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 16, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $258.15*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $45.25 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 6, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
16, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 16, 2018, then starting April 17,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 17, 2018.
8.      If,
on or before April 16, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,935.64** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after April 17, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
10.   If
the Tenants void this order by paragraph # 8 or # 9 then the Tenants will pay
to the Landlord the monthly rent when it comes due on the first day of each
month starting on May 1, 2018 and continuing until April 1, 2019 inclusive.
11.   Failure
to do as directed in paragraph # 10 will allow the Landlord to apply to the
board under Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act (2006), without
notice to the Tenants, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants. The Landlord must make this application no later than 30 days after
the Tenant’s failure to make a payment. As part of this application, the
Landlord can also request an order for arrears, damages, NSF cheque fees and
related administrative charges and the cost of filing the application.
