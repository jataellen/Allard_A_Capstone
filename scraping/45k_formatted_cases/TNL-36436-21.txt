Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36436-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


901, 411 DUPLEX
AVENUE TORONTO ON M4R1V2


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Chauntelle Bowen


Tenant



 
On December 20,
2021, Capreit Limited Partnership. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Chauntelle Bowen (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on December 3, 2021 with respect to
application TNL-33262-21 AM.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$3,947.00 on or before November
29, 2021 towards costs,
arrears of rent and NSF charges.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $3,947.00 for rent arrears in Order TNL-33262-21 AM. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,947.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-33262-21 AM is
cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant
has also failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-33262-21 AM is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,642.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $55.73
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.

of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
