In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR UNIT,
364 ELLIOTT STREET HAILEYBURY ON P0J1K0


 




Between:


Deftac Systems Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Megan Arthurs Travis Fougere


Tenants



 
 
Deftac Systems Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Travis Fougere and Megan Arthurs (the
'Tenants') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 25, 2021 at
10:38am. Only the Landlord’s agents, Darcy Griffith
and Kelly Griffith, attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.    
By way of background, this is a month-to-month tenancy
in which rent is due on the first
of the month in the amount of $693.94.
This tenancy began on October
1, 2018. The residential complex is a duplex where
the Tenants reside on the main floor.
 
2.     As of the hearing date, the Tenants
remain in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a second N5
notice of termination served to the Tenants
on July 18, 2021 by mail with a termination date of August 18, 2021 pursuant to subsection 68(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
4.     In order to serve a second N5, the Landlord must have
served a valid first N5 notice of termination.
The Landlord’s evidence
was the first N5 was served to the Tenants
on May 8, 2021 by mail with a
termination date of June 7, 2021 pursuant to subsection 62(1) of the Act.
 
5.    
The damages identified on the
first N5 are also found on the second N5, along with new damages to the rental
unit. As such, I restricted the Landlord’s evidence to only those damages that
occurred after the remedy period (May 13-20, 2021) that were outlined on the second
N5 notice of termination which include the following: a broken kitchen
window




 
frame, removal of the smoke detector
in the living room and back bedroom,
and door trim around front hall closet broken.
 
TERMINATION OF THE TENANCY
FOR DAMAGE
 
6.    
The Landlord’s uncontested
evidence was that on July 18, 2021 at
3:00pm, the Landlord attended the premises to conduct an inspection of the rental unit to find more damage
to the rental unit than what was discovered on the first N5 after the inspection took place on May 7, 2021.
 
7.     The window in the kitchen was broken; the window
screens had holes in them; and the window frame was broken as well. With respect to the smoke detectors, after the first N5
was served, the Landlord testified that he went to the rental unit to fix this
issue and installed a new smoke detector in the living room. On July 18, 2021,
he discovered that this smoke detector
had been removed once again
as well as the smoke detector
by the back bedroom.
 
8.    
With respect to the door trim
around the front hall closet, the Landlord submitted a photograph showing
that the doors had been removed from the closet.
The damage to the door trim appears to be consistent
with the negligent removal of the doors.
 
9.     The Landlord testified that he asked the Tenants about
the damaged property, but the Tenants denied causing
any damage or being responsible for the damage.
As such, the Landlord seeks a termination of the
tenancy and reimbursement of the application filing fee.
 
ANALYSIS
 
10.  Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am
satisfied that the Tenants have willfully and negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit’s window screen
in the kitchen, smoke detectors and
door trim by the front hall closet. I say this based on the Landlord’s evidence and the
photograph submitted. The Tenant knew
or ought to have known that by removing closet doors,
damage would occur to either its door, frame or trim; and that by disconnected
the smoke detectors, damage could occur to the wiring, impeding the ability for
its reconnection.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
August 18, 2021. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 14, 2022.




 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February 15, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 15, 2022.
