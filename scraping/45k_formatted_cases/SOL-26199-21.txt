Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26199-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 5365 FERRY STREET NIAGARA FALLS ON L2G1R9


 




Between:


Inayat Hudda


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Koteles


Tenant



 
 
 
Inayat Hudda (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Koteles (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord intends
to do major repairs or renovations to the
rental unit.
 
This application
was heard by video conference on January 19, 2022. The Landlord was represented at the hearing
by his agent Aziz Merchant.
The Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with the notice of hearing by
the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated to major repairs
to the rental unit. I am satisfied that the Landlord has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary permits for this work.
 
2.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
one month’s compensation, by way of rent credit
for the month of July 2021,
in accordance with section 52 (2) of the Act.
 
3.     The Landlord’s agent was unaware of any circumstances
that would warrant delaying eviction. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 12, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 12, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
$20.38 for each day he remains in the unit beginning
February 01, 2022.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
12, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 13, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 12, 2022, then starting February
13, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 13, 2022.
 
 
February 1, 2022
