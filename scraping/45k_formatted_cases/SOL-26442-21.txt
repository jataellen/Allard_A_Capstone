Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Steven Seifried


Tenant



 
 
 
Mafisa Developments Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steven
Seifried (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage
to the premises.
 
The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises.
 
This application was heard via
video conference on February 2,
2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative Jane Dean and the Landlord’s representative Carlo Finoro (‘C.F.’) attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     As a preliminary matter, the Landlord
requested to not proceed with eviction proceedings under the N7 notice
of termination as the Tenant
was believed to have vacated
the rental unit which was
stated in an executed N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy as at January 31, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative
requested to proceed and rely upon the section 89 undue damage claim under the
L2 application itself.
 
2.     As the Tenant was not present and it did not prejudice
the Tenant, I did not object to proceeding only with the section 89
undue damage claim.
 
3.     In order for an application to succeed under
subsection 89 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) a landlord must establish the following:




 
 
 
a.   
There was property damage to
the rental unit or
residential complex;
 
b.   
The damage is “undue” meaning
that it is not normal
wear and tear and it is not insignificant; and
 
c.   
The damage
was a result of wilful
or negligent conduct
by the tenant, guest or occupant.
 
 
4.    
If the Landlord establishes all of
these elements, then the Board can award the reasonable cost of repair
– the replacement cost cannot
be awarded unless
it is not reasonable for the damage to be repaired.
 
5.     The Landlord submitted
invoices and quotes in support
of his undue damage claim under
section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
6.     C.F. testified that he observed video footage from
security cameras in the residential complex that showed
the Tenant on August 7, 2021 utilizing the fire extinguisher even though there was no fire event in the common area of the
residential complex. The Landlord
submitted an emailed quote for recharging the fire extinguisher. C.F. seeks
$209.47 which represents the cost
for the fire extinguisher to be re-charged.
 
7.     C.F. testified that he again observed video footage
from security cameras in the residential complex which allegedly showed the Tenant’s
guests on August 29, 2021 kicking in the front entrance
door which damaged that door. C.F. provided an invoice
in the amount of $124.30 representing the cost to repair the front entrance
door.
 
8.     C.F. testified that during an inspection of the rental
unit on September 20, 2021, he observed damage consisting of holes in the drywall
in three rooms
of the rental unit which were as a result of the Tenant or
his guests kicking and punching the drywall.
Further, a door had a hole in it and the trim around the door had been
ripped off. C.F. provided a quote stating
that the cost to
repair the door, drywall, door trim
and then paint the affected walls was $2,260.00.
 
9.     The N11 Agreement to End Tenancy filed with the Board
and signed by the Tenant admits the Tenant’s
responsibility of damage incurred in the amount
of $2,593.77 which is the same amount as indicated in
the L2 application.
 
10.  C.F. testified that he is familiar with the Tenant as he has lived in the complex for 1.5
years, C.F. is on the property
daily and has had
interactions with the Tenant and the Tenant has admitted his
responsibility for the damage.
 
11.  The onus under this application rests with the
Landlord and based on the uncontested evidence and submissions, I am satisfied,
on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant and/or his guests damaged the
fire extinguisher, damaged the front entrance door and damaged the drywall, trim,
and a door in the rental
unit, all of which is claimed under
the L2 application, and that the Tenant and/or his guests wilfully
caused undue damage to




 
the rental unit and the residential complex. I am satisfied that the costs to affect
the repairs is reasonable and an order will follow accordingly.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,593.77, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage.
 
2.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 2, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 3, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

Date Issued
 
Southern-RO
119 King Street West,
