File Number: EAL-98884-21




In the matter
of:


314, 1300 MCWATTERS ROAD OTTAWA ON K2C3M5


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jennifer
Martin


Tenant



 
 
On November 8, 2021,
Homestead Land
Holdings Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer
Martin (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order
issued by the Board on June 22, 2021 with respect to application EAL-93928-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay $637.59
on or before September 15, 2021 and October
15, 2021 towards arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $5,400.74 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
EAL-93928-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $2,573.74 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-93928-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also
failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
September 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,395.57 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: EAL-98884-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 16, 2021 to January 5, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-93928-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,507.53*. This amount represents the rent owing up to October 31, 2021 and
the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $45.04
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting November 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
