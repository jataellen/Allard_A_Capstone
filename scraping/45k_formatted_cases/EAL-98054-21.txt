Tenants




 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
John Johnson and Cherry Vriesendorp (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Briar
Hurst attended the hearing. As of 9:54 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on December 21, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,400.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1, 2021 to
September 30, 2021.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants vacated

21, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,174.00*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
21, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
