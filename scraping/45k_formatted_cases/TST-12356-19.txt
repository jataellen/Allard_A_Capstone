Order under Section 57
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TST-12356-19
 
 
 
 
HC and DC (the ‘Tenants’) applied for an order that MG
(the ‘Landlord’) has given a notice of termination in bad faith
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 26, 2021.
 
The Tenants Legal Representative TS, the Tenant DC, the Landlords
Legal Representative EV  and the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served
a N12 notice of termination on the Tenants
with a termination date of
July 31, 2019 on basis the rental unit had been sold and the purchasers
intended to reside in the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenants entered
into a new lease agreement
on June 4 2019 with a tenancy
start date of July 15, 2019.
 
3.     It was uncontested that the purchase
agreement fell through,
and that the Tenants were advised on July 13, 2019 that the
sale had been cancelled at which time the Tenants indicated that they had
already entered into a new lease agreement.
 
4.    
Eventually, the property was sold in February 2020.
 
5.     The Tenants moved out of the rental
unit because the Landlord gave the Tenants
a notice of termination claiming the purchaser of the residential
complex required possession of the rental unit.
 
6.     I am satisfied that the Landlord gave a notice in bad
faith, as the sale did not close as advised in the N12 notice,
and the Landlord subsequently relisted
the property and was
sold with a closing in February 2020.
