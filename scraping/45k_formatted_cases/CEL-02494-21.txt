Guo Shui Shao (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nancy Maxwell and Crystal Maxwell

the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:

10, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The N12 notice to terminate
the tenancy for landlord’s own use was served on the
Tenants on July 9, 2021. The
termination date on the notice is August 31, 2021.
 
2.     Section 48.2 of the Residential Tenancies Act requires that the termination date on the notice be at least 60 days after the
notice is served.
 
3.    
I
find the notice was served
on the Tenants less than 60 days prior to the termination date on the notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
