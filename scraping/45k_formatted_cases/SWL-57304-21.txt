and


 




 


Sarah Antone


Tenant



 
On November 18, 2021, Inter Faith
Homes (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sarah Antone (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on August 5, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49410-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord
$118.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$1,349.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-49410-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,109.00
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-49410-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from September 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-49410-21 is cancelled.




File Number: SWL-57304-21
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,345.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$3.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
