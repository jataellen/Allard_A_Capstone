Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
NOL-43956-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
31
  CABOT STREET SUDBURY ON P3C4K2


 




Between:


Greater Sudbury Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lorelei Trudeau


Tenant



 
 
 
Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lorelei
Trudeau (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Agent, Melissa Chickoine attended the hearing. As of 11:19 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 23, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$1,317.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     
The Tenant paid $3,252.16
after the application was filed.
 
6.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,001.10*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 20, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $43.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $3,638.10** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 1, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
