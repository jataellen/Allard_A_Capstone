Tenant



 
 
 
Brittany Zeglen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Matthew James (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of 10:23 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from February
1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on November
2, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,700.00.
 
4.      The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,700.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from December 11, 2019 to September 30, 2021.

$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
