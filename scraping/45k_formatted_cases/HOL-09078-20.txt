In the matter
of:


106, 106 BENHURST CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L7A5A5


 




Between:


Naynaben Pathak


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Marsha Lee Ferrigon


Tenant



 
 
 
Naynaben Pathak (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marsha Lee Ferrigon (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 7, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The application is dismissed because
the notice of termination is invalid.
 
2.     The Landlord
submitted a rent ledger into evidence which indicated that the arrears
were
$7,699.80 at the time the notice of termination was served on the Tenant.
The Landlord confirmed that
the rent ledger was accurate at the hearing.
 
3.     The notice of termination
identifies the arrears
as being $11,116.40, not $7,699.80.
 
4.    
As the amount claimed
in the notice of termination was more than was lawfully owed, the
notice of termination is invalid.
 
5.     As a result,
the Landlord’s application must be dismissed
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
