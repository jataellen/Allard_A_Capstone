Tenants



 
 
Galaxy Real Estate Core Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Werknesh
Gebreyohannes and Fitsum
Abraha (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. As
of 1:51 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Agent, Gail Kukor-Lang
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants paid the Landlord for the period ending January
31, 2022. The amount paid represents all the rent that was in
arrears under the tenancy agreement and any additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy
agreement on the date of the
Tenants’ payment. The only amount
outstanding is the balance of the Landlord’s cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$36.68 for the cost of filing the application.
 
2.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 21,
2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 22,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
