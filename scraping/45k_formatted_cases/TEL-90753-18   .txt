Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-90753-18
 











 
 
 

S.U. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict A.J.(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 30, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s son, U.A., the
Landlord’s representative, C.N., and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 27, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $5,300.00. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,650.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 12, 2018 to April 27, 2018,
in the amount of $13.85.
6.     
The Tenant lives alone in
the rental unit and has lived there since February 2018. 
7.     
At the hearing, the Tenant
provided very convoluted and unclear testimony regarding an apparent family law
matter in which she is involved. The Tenant says that the family law matter has
stalled and, until she is able to obtain her ex-husband’s signature on a
document, she cannot get access to her assets. The Tenant’s ex-husband is
currently under a peace bond, so it is unclear how or when the Tenant will be
able to obtain access to her funds. Until that time, the Tenant does not
dispute that she cannot afford to live in the rental unit where the monthly
rent is $2,650.00 and she cannot afford to pay the substantial outstanding
arrears. 
8.     
It is also concerning to me
that the Tenant was unable to provide any documentation regarding this alleged
family law matter. The Tenant says she has retained a lawyer to assist her, but
when we attempted to contact the lawyer in the hearing room, she did not answer
her phone. The Tenant provided no retainer letter or other document to confirm
that she has actually retained legal counsel to assist her. 
9.     
The Tenant was also unable
to provide any documentation regarding the alleged funds to which she is trying
to gain access. The Tenant provided no letter, no statement, no legal document
of any kind to substantiate her testimony. For this reason, I do not find the
Tenant’s testimony on this issue to be credible. Even if I were satisfied that
the Tenant could somehow gain access to her funds, the Tenant was unable to
explain precisely when she could gain access and how much money would be
available to her at that time. 
10.  
Near the conclusion of the
hearing, when it became clear that the Tenant could not afford the rental unit
or the arrears, the Tenant asked to speak to duty counsel. However, at that
point, the Tenant had already been at the hearing location for well over two
hours and she could not explain to the Board why she had failed to speak to
duty counsel during that time. For this reason, the Tenant’s request was
denied. 
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 17,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,173.28*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 6, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $87.12 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 7, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 17, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 18,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 17, 2018, then starting June 18, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 18, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 17,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,140.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 18, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
