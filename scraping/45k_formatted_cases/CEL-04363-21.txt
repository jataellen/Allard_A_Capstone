Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04363-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 48 RADENHURST CRESCENT BARRIE ON L4M6C6


 




Between:


Olga Velic


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Fidel Isiah Gollop


Tenant



 
 
 
Olga Velic (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Fidel Isiah
Gollop (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on December 6, 2021 with
respect to application CEL-02388-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay $1,000.00 on
or before December 15, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $9,801.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-02388-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $8,201.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-02388-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022.




File Number: CEL-04363-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order CEL-02388-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$6,601.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
