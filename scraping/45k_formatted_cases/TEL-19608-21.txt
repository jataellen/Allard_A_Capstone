Order under Section
87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


2, 2 STRATTON AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1K3V2


 




Between:


Niroja Arulananthan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eric Rowe


Tenants



 
 
 
 
Niroja Arulananthan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eric Rowe (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent Pran Ganesh attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On September
3, 2021 the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination (N4 notice) with a
termination date of September 17, 2021. The N4 notice claims that the Tenant
owes
$13,606.94 for the period from
July 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord’s N4 notice of termination is defective
as it does not set out the lawful rent charged for the period of July 1, 2020 –
July 31, 2021. The Landlord’ N4 notice indicates that for this period, the Tenant
has been charged $15,821.94 in rent, has paid $4,415.00 and owes $11,406.94. However, the lawful rent for this period
was $1,100.00.
Therefore, the total rent owing for this 13-month
period equals to only $14,300.00 charged. Once the Tenant’s payment of $4,415.00 is applied, the Tenant
owes
$9,885.00 in arrears of rent for this period,
and not $11,406.94 as claimed by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
As the Landlord’s N4 notice does not set out the correct amount charged and is requiring the Tenant to pay more than the
Landlord is lawfully entitled to, the notice does not comply with section 59(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). As the N4 notice is defective the
Board does not have the authority to terminate the tenancy.
 
4.     The Landlord’s Agent was explained the options available as a result
of the defective N4 including; withdrawing the L1
application, serving a new N4 notice and filing a new




 
application or proceeding with the current
application to collect
arrears of rent only
pursuant to Section 87 (1) (a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
Act).
 
5.     The Landlord’s Agent was advised that the option to
proceed with arrears of rent only would not result in a termination of tenancy
should the Tenant breach, but rather would have to be enforced
in another jurisdiction such as small claims court for collection of any outstanding funds owing. The Landlord’s Agent was also advised that the Landlord
would not be permitted to claim these arrears on a new N4 if the option
to proceed with arrears only was selected.
 
6.     The Landlord’s Agent
requested that the matter proceed
with claiming arrears
of rent only and confirmed that he understood the
remedies available should the Tenant not comply with the terms of the order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$16,485.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
