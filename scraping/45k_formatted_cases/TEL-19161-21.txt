In the matter
of:


B
  LOWER, 535 PARNELL ST PETERBOROUGH ON K9J4J5


 




Between:


Grant Kent


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Francesca Lentini


Tenant



 
 
 
Grant Kent
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Francesca Lentini (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out
an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex involving the production of an illegal drug, the trafficking in an
illegal drug or the possession of an illegal drug for the purposes of
trafficking. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Video Conference Room 122 on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Grant Kelly, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Crystal Francey, attended
the hearing. As of 10:36 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,750.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.




File Number: TEL-19161-21
 
 
 
5.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month’s
rent deposit.
 
6.    
The Landlord sought to withdraw
the L2 application and the Board consented to the request.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $15,847.91*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 26, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $57.53 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 6, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 6, 2022, then starting February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the
unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$16,251.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$18,001.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TEL-19161-21
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 7, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
