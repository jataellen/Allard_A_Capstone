Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Joan Rincon


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Joan Rincon (the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Hayley Seeger,
attended the hearing. As of 2:14 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on September 30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,044.62.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid a
last month’s rent deposit of $1,004.09 on October 1, 2018. The Landlord owes the Tenant $40.16
in interest on that deposit.
As a result, an amount of
$1,044.25 will be deducted
from any amount
determined to be
owing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$140.60. The balance
of the filing fee when the last month’s rent and deposit are applied
against the amounts outstanding.




File Number: SWL-55408-21
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
