Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-03502-19
 











 
 
 

Inc.. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict M. H., J. M. and J. B. (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Peterborough on August 29,
2019.
 
The Landlord and Jennifer Murray attended the hearing. The Landlord
was represented by S. H. 
 
Also present was the Landlord’s Witness,
F. B.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES
 
A.  
SERVICE OF THE N4 NOTICE OF TERMINATION
1.    The Landlord’s L1 application is based on an N4 notice
of termination with a termination date of July 31, 2019. 
2.    The certificate of service (“COS”) filed with the
Board indicates the N4 notice of termination was served on the Tenants on August
16, 2019, which is after the termination date. 
3.    The Landlord’s representative, who served the N4
notice of termination, testified that the COS contains an error and the N4 notice
of termination was in fact served on July 17, 2019. 
4.    This is consistent with the signature date found
on the second page of the N4 notice of termination that shows the N4 was signed
on July 16, 2019. 
5.    I find that the N4 notice of termination was served
in accordance with the notice requirements contained in subsection 59(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). 
B.  
IS J. M. A TENANT?
6.     
JM attended the hearing as a
named Tenant and testified that she moved into the rental unit on May 31, 2019 and
was kicked out of the rental unit by the other Tenants on June 2, 2019, with the first-named Tenant taking
her keys. She stated that the third-named Tenant’s fiancée didn’t like her, which
resulted in a dispute between the Tenants, so the two Tenants decided to kick her out. Since then, she has had
no access to the rental unit, although some of her items remained in the rental
unit. 
7.     
Her evidence was that she informed[FE(1]  the Landlord shortly thereafter that the Tenants had kicked her out. She stated that she wasn’t even
aware of the hearing date until she called the Landlord who told her to attend.
This was not contested by the Landlord. 
8.     
The Landlord takes the position
that as she signed the lease with the other Tenants, that this
was a joint tenancy. The Landlord did not receive a notice from the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy, the Landlord did not kick JM out of the rental unit and the Tenants did not agree to take JM’s name off the lease. Thus,
JM should still be held accountable for the outstanding rent as the Tenants are joint and severally liable. 
9.     
I asked the Landlord to submit
a copy of the lease on or before August 30, 2019. As of the date of this order,
the lease has not been submitted. However,
JM’s evidence was that she signed the lease agreement with the other two Tenants for
the rental unit. 
10.  
Subparagraph 87(1)(b) of the Act says:
87.  (1)  A landlord may apply to the Board for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent if,
(a)      the tenant has not paid rent lawfully required under the
tenancy agreement; and
(b)      the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
                      [Emphasis added.]
11.  
Therefore, question before the Board
is whether JM was in possession of the rental unit when the Landlord’s L1 application
was filed on August 1, 2019. 
12.  
The leading and definitive case
on the meaning of the phrase “in possession of the rental unit” is the Court of Appeal’s decision in 1162994 Ontario Inc. v.
Bakker, 2004 CanLII 59995 (ON CA) (“Bakker”). It says at paragraphs 18 to 22:
[18]…I think the requirement that the tenant be
"in possession of the rental unit" at the time of the application
reflects a determination that rent arrears disputes can be resolved efficiently
and fairly through the Tribunal where the tenant at the time of the application
continues to have some connection with the rental unit and, therefore, some
relationship with the landlord. Situations where that connection has been
severed and the relationship gone are best resolved through the more formal court
processes. 
[19] Some further assistance in defining "tenant in
possession" is found by an examination of s. 86(2). That subsection
provides that a landlord may be compensated for "the use and
occupation" of a rental unit after notice of termination of the lease. A
landlord can only be compensated, however, if the tenant is "in possession
of the rental unit" when the landlord's application is made. This
suggests that a "tenant in possession" is a person who was using or
occupying the rental unit at the time of the application but does not
necessarily indicate that the phrase is limited to users and occupiers. 
[20] Possession is a difficult concept to define. Both in
common and legal parlance, it connotes some form of control over the thing said
to be possessed: e.g. D. D, B. N, The Dictionary of Canadian Law 2nd ed.,
(1995) Carswell at p. 916; The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. II
(1973) p. 1635. Clearly, possession in s. 86(1)(b) is not limited to immediate
physical control. For example, a tenant who locks up a rental unit and leaves
on an extended vacation, continues to exercise sufficient control over that
rental unit so as to qualify as a "tenant in possession" for the
purposes of s. 86(1)(b). In my view, possession of a rental unit refers to
some form of control over that unit as demonstrated by factors such as access
to, use of, or occupation of the unit. 
[21] There will be cases, although I would not think a
great many, where a determination of whether the tenant was "in possession
of the rental unit" at the time of the application will raise a difficult
issue. In those cases, the Tribunal will have to decide, based on the
evidence, whether there is a sufficient connection between the rental unit and
the tenant to permit a finding that the tenant was "in possession" of
that rental unit. 
[22] In this case, there was no connection between Bakker and
the rental unit at the time the s. 86 application was commenced. Bakker  exercised no control over that unit. He had
unequivocally, completely, and permanently vacated the unit more than two years
before the application. 
[Emphasis added.]
13.  
 As can be seen from this
extract, questions of possession are to be determined on a case by case basis. In
this case, the Board is to determine what sort of control JM exercised over the
unit at the time the application was filed, whether she had access to it, used
it for any purpose, or otherwise had a connection to the rental unit. 
14.  
Given the evidence before the Board,
I am satisfied that JM was not in possession of the rental unit on August 1, 2019,
when this application was filed. 
15.  
I say this because the evidence
is uncontested that the two other Tenants removed her from the rental unit and took
her keys, giving her no access or control of the rental unit. The only connection
JM has to the rental unit is with regards to her belongings still being in there,
only because she does not have the means to go and remove these items. I do not
find that she has a real connection to the rental unit just because some of her
belongings are still there. 
16.  
 Further, the Landlord’s evidence
was that they were aware of the situation. Prior to JM’s removal of the rental unit,
the hydro bill was in JM’s name. Since she was removed, the hydro bill went into
the first-named Tenant’s name until it was cut off at the end July 2019. 
17.  
 As JM was not in
possession of the rental unit when the application was filed she cannot be named
as a party because Board lacks the jurisdiction under s. 87 to order JM to pay
anything to the Landlord. Her name will be removed from this order. 
18.  
As JM was removed as a party and
the other two named Tenants were not present at the hearing, the merits of the Landlord’s
application were heard on an uncontested basis.
APPLICATION
FOR ARREARS OF RENT
19.  
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2019
to August 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 31, 2019.
20.  
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
21.  
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 26, 2019 to July 31, 2019.
22.  
The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.

23.  
The arrears and costs owing to
August 31, 2019 total $2,575.00.
24.  
Since the hearing the rents for
September 2019 through to January 2020 have also come due. 
25.  
An order shall issue accordingly.

26.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is
unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief from eviction. 
27.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The application is amended to
remove Jennifer Murray as a named Tenant. 
2.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February
7, 2020.
3.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,098.87 (less any payments made to the Landlord after the hearing date)*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 27,
2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $39.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 28, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 7, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 8, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 7, 2020, then starting February 8, 2020, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 8, 2020.
9.     
If the Tenants wish to
void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust:
i)        $8,575.00 (less any payments made to the Landlord after the hearing date)
if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $9,775.00 (less any payments made to the Landlord after the hearing date)
if the payment is made on or before February 7, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 8,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
