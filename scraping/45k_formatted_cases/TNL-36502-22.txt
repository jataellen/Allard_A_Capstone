On January 7, 2022, Louis Lu
and 676916 Ontario Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Edward Bursey (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant entered
into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.       
The Landlords and the Tenant
signed an N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy form agreeing to terminate the tenancy with effective termination date December 31, 2021; but the Tenant did not move out of the
rental unit by the termination date set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
6, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
