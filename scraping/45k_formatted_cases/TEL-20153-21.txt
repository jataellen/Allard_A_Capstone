Steffen Lindenthal (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rob Zawaski
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant:
and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has used the
rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with
use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause
significant damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
25, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord testified that the Tenant
has remedied the issues N7 notice to terminate the tenancy related to wilful damage and
seriously impaired safety. As a result, the Landlord chose not to proceed with the allegations to
terminate the tenancy.
 
2.     On October 9, 2020 the served a 1st N5 notice on the Tenant. The issue that gave rise to
the notice regarding substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment or
lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant related
to the Tenant not mowing the lawn. The
Landlord alleges there are weeds and shrubs growing. The Landlord’s notice alleges
this is inviting
pests and rodents
which is leading
to interference with the
municipality, other tenants, and neighbours.
 
3.     The Landlord acknowledged that the 1st N5 notice served
on the Tenant was voided.
 
4.    
The Landlord
served another N5 notice on the Tenant on October 18, 2021. This was also a 1st N5 notice. The notice was signed on October 18, 2021, and the certificate of




File Number: TEL-20153-21
 
service shows it was served on the Tenant
on October 18, 2021. As this was another 1st N5 notice, the termination date must be at least
20 days after the Tenant is served. In
this case the termination date is November 3, 2021 which is less than the
required 20 days. As well, a landlord
must wait until after the 7 day voiding period on a 1st N5 notice to file an application with the Board. The Landlord filed the application on
October 18, 2021, the same day the Tenant was served.
 
5.     As the 1st N5 notice was voided by the Tenant, the Landlord chose
not to proceed with the N7 notice,
and the Landlord has not complied with the requirements of the Residential Tenancies Act with the
N5 notice served on the Tenant on October 18, 2021, the application cannot succeed in termination of the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
