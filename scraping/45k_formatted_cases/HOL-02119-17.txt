Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02119-17
 










 
 
 

H.L
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict V.L
and V.G.B (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 15, 2018.  The Landlord and the
Tenants attended the hearing.
 
This
was a bilingual hearing in which the Landlord participated in English, the
Tenants participated in French and S.B interpreted between the two languages. 
This order is issued in English and in French.
 
The
Tenants are referred to as VL and VGB in this order.  A previous tenant, E.R,
is referred to as ER.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
first question to be determined is whether the Tenants are, in fact, tenants of
the rental unit.
2.      A
tenancy began in May, 2017 when VL and ER moved in.  VGB moved in one month
later, and ER moved out the month after because, in the words of the Landlord’s
lawyer, she “did not feel safe in the presence of (VGB).” 
3.      The
Tenants took the position that either VL or VL and ER together remained tenants
and that VGB was only a guest.  The Landlord argued that even though the
Tenants declined to sign a written tenancy agreement that his lawyer had
prepared, there was an oral agreement of a new tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenants.
4.      I
prefer the Landlord’s position over that of the Tenants for three reasons. 
First, because it was clear to everyone that ER intended to vacate the rental
unit.  Second, because it was also clear that VGB had moved in.  And third, there
was a new tenancy with the Tenants as tenants because the definition of tenant
in subsection 2(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
includes “a person who pays rent in return for the right to occupy a rental
unit” where VGB sometimes paid rent.
5.      The
Tenants were therefore correctly named as tenant parties to the application and
in the notice of termination preceding it.
6.      Next,
I turn to the issue of last month rent deposits (LMR).  
7.      When
ER and VL moved in, they paid the Landlord an LMR of $2,000.00.  The Landlord
testified referring to his ledger that when ER moved out, the Landlord applied
half of the LMR, which he took to be ER’s portion, and applied it to the rent due
September 1, 2017.  The Landlord further testified that he only received
$1,000.00 more that month which he applied to rent, which was not
cross-examined or contradicted by the Tenants.
8.      The
Tenants took the position that the part of the LMR paid out to ER was done
unlawfully and that the Landlord was wrongly seeking to replenish that amount through
this application.  I disagree on both counts.
9.      As
to the first issue, the Tenants referred to the rarely used section 47.2 of the
Act which provides that a joint tenant can terminate a tenancy “if the tenant
is deemed under subsection 47.3(1) to have experienced violence or another form
of abuse…”  The Tenants did not specifically refer to that latter subsection,
but there was no evidence that any of those possibilities, namely criminal
sureties to keep the peace, restraining orders, allegations of serious violence
or threats or sexual violence, were present in this situation.  Had that
subsection applied, the LMR would have gone to the benefit of the person who
did not give notice, VGB.  The very mention of the subsection actually
supported the Landlord’s position that there was a new tenancy with VGB as a
Tenant where he was claiming the entirety of the LMR as his.  However, the
subsection did not apply, therefore the LMR could only be applied to the last
month of the tenancy. 
10.   The
Landlord’s position appeared to be that the first tenancy, with VL and ER as
tenants, had to be terminated on notice, where he applied ER’s half of the LMR
to the rent due for September, 2017.  He kept the other half, belonging to VL,
to apply to LMR for the new tenancy with the Tenants as tenants.  The Landlord
testified he did not receive the rest of the new LMR that he thought should
have been paid by VGB.
11.   The
Tenants argued that the Landlord was actually claiming the LMR in this
application which would not have been permissible because an LMR is not arrears
of rent.  In fact, I find the claim was not for LMR but for the $1,000.00 not
paid in October, 2017.  That amount was indicated as owing in the application
for November, 2017, but the Landlord applied rent received after service of the
N4 notice of termination and prior to the filing of the application to the
oldest arrears of rent, a perfectly acceptable accounting practice.
12.   I
therefore see no defect in the Landlord’s application.
13.   The
Tenants also brought cheque with them to pay for rent for January, 2018 and it
was not noticed whether the Landlord collected that cheque.  If that amount was
paid, it should be deducted from the arrears of rent below.
14.   The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 23, 2017.
15.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,000.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
16.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 29, 2017
to November 23, 2017.
17.   The
Tenants paid $2,000.00 after the application was filed.
18.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenants indicated
they could pay all arrears of rent owing within the time allowed by a standard
order.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 4, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,580.24*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 4, 2018, then starting February
5, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,175.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,175.00 if the payment is made on or before February 4, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 5, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
