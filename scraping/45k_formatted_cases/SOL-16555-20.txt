Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-16555-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


171 ALICE STREET GUELPH ON N1E3A3


 




Between:


Mirella Scapin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brenda
  Lewis


Tenant



 
 
 
Mirella Scapin
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brenda
Lewis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord has also applied to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant or a person visiting or living
with the Tenant has wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 29, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
11:37 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing as it appears from the Certificate
of Service.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
24, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $920.00
 
4.    
The arrears
of rent owing for the period ending October 31, 2021, as of the date of hearing, were $1,000.00.
 
5.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
 
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from March 16, 2018 to August 24, 2020.
 
8.    
The Tenant
paid $15,680.00 after the application was filed.
 
L2 Application
 
9.    
This application is
based on non voidable Notice of Termination (form ‘N5’) because the Tenant or
someone visiting or living with the Tenant wilfully or negligently damage the
rental unit or the residential complex. There
was no monetary claim for damages. The
notice was deemed served on August 8, 2020 with a termination date of August 24, 2020. The notice was served pursuant to
sec. 68 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
10.  S. 68 of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of tenancy if,
 
(a)  
A notice
of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64, or 67; and
 
(b)  
More than seven days
but less than six months after the notice mentioned in clause (a) was given to
the tenant, an activity takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises
that constitutes grounds
for a notice of termination under section 60, 61,
62 ,64 or 67…
 
11.  In this case the Landlord did not provide
the Board with a copy of any previous notice given to the Tenant as required by s. 68. Therefore, I am unable to examine it to determine whether or not
the Notice for which the application was filed is valid. In short, because there is no first notice available, the second notice is void. The L2 application is dismissed.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including whether or not the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a repayment plan with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application (L2 Application) related to wilful
damage of the rental complex or rental unit is dismissed.
 
2.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $ 1,516.42
* (less any payment made to the Landlord after October 29, 2021), which represents the amount of rent owing and




 
compensation up to January
7, 2022 less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.25 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $221.00
for the cost of filing
the application and administration costs for an NSF
cheque.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 18, 2022, the Tenant shall start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated form January 19,
2022 at 2 % annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
9.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,361.00(less any payment made to the Landlord after October 29, 2021)** to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust,
this order for eviction will be void. This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit. If this payment is not made
in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
10.

The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount

Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
