In the matter of:


19, 75 OLD CHICOPEE DRIVE KITCHENER ON N2A2G4


 




Between:


Holborn Holdings Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Keith Lee Michelle
Lewis


Tenants



 
 
 
Holborn Holdings Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle Lewis and Keith Lee (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, Benjamin Burke,
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue
 
1.    
The sign-in process for the
hearing block began at 8:30am and the hearing was scheduled to start at 9:00am.
I waited until approximately 11:00am and I canvased the virtual hearing room,
the virtual reception area, the virtual waiting room and all of the breakout
rooms to confirm whether the Tenants attended the hearing. The Tenants’ names
did not appear in any of these areas, I was satisfied that the Tenants failed
to attend the hearing and I proceeded to hear the Landlord’s application as an uncontested matter.
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
2.    
The Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. According to the Landlord’s
application, the Tenants have paid their
rent late 15 out of 15 times since
December 2020.




File Number: SWL-56986-21
 
3.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
March 7, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022,
then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.

81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
