Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24111-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2603, 250 DAVENPORT ROAD TORONTO ON M5R1J8


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing
Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Samuel
Sasha Musango


Tenant



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Samuel Sasha Musango (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Dale Maingot,
attended the hearing.
As of 10:48 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2019 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 29,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $705.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid $3,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $5,297.08*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 14, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $23.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 25, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January 26, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 26, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 25, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,846.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.

Toronto South-RO
15 Grosvenor Street, 1st Floor Toronto ON M7A 2G6
