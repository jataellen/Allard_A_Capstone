Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05535-18










 

WPMI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KAA
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on July 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, JA, the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, BK, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective May 25, 2018.
 
2.      The
Landlord incurred charges of $15.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
 
3.      The
Tenant did not dispute the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s rental arrears
and NSF and administration charges.
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,250.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 8, 2017 to
May 25, 2018.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.  
 
7.      At
the hearing, the Tenant’s representative requested relief from eviction.  The
Tenant adduced evidence that she is a person with a disability.  The Tenant
also testified that her financial circumstances have changed.  The Tenant’s
son, and another roommate, will occupy the other two bedrooms at the rental
unit.  The three residents will each contribute to the monthly rent for the
rental property.
 
8.      The
Landlord’s representative opposed relief from eviction.  The Landlord’s
representative adduced evidence of a previous application to the Board because
of the Tenant’s failure to pay the rent she was required to pay.  Since this
proceeding was the second in as many years, the Landlord’s representative
submitted that it would be unfair to grant further relief from eviction.  The
Landlord’s representative submitted that the business of being a landlord
requires that landlords be able to reliably collect rent as it becomes due and
payable.
 
9.      I
certainly appreciate the Landlord’s representative’s position.  Landlords are,
indeed, entitled to collect rent as it becomes due and payable.  If a tenant
does not pay rent in full and on time, the landlord is exposed to financial
losses.
 
10.   However,
the Act, like all legislation in the Province of Ontario, is remedial.  In Matthews
v. Algoma Timberlakes Corp., 2010 ONCA 468 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2710 (C.A.), the Court
of Appeal for Ontario ruled, at paragraph 22:  “Given the remedial nature of
the Act, its provisions must be interpreted liberally to ensure the realization
of its objectives.”  At paragraph 32, the Court of Appeal concluded:  “The
purpose of the legislation is to provide protections to tenants.”  
 
11.   The
Court of Appeal for Ontario’s reasons in Matthews v. Algoma
Timberlakes Corp. is consistent with earlier decisions by the Court, and by
the Divisional Court, that the purpose of landlord and tenant legislation is to
promote security of tenure.
 
12.   I
therefore find that, as the Divisional Court determined in Sutherland v.
Lamontagne, [2008] O.J. No. 5763 (Div. Ct.), terminating a tenancy and
evicting a tenant from a rental unit is a remedy of last resort.
 
13.   In
this case, the Tenant adduced evidence of a change in her circumstances, which
change will promote prompt and regular payment of the monthly rent and the
Tenant’s rental arrears.  I therefore find that it is not unfair to issue a
conditional order that reflects the payment plan the Tenant proposed at the
hearing.
 
14.   If
the Tenant fails to comply with this conditional order, the Landlord shall have
the right to apply to the Board, without notice to the Tenant, for an eviction
order against the Tenant.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant owes the Landlord $4,015.00* for the period ending July 31, 2018.  This
amount represents the Tenant’s rental arrears, NSF and administration charges,
and the Landlord’s Board filing costs.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay the amount in paragraph one, above, to the Landlord in
accordance with the following payment plan:
 
a.    $1,250.00
on or before July 20, 2018;
b.    Rent
for August 2018, and $553.00, on August 1, 2018;
c.    Rent
for September 2018, and $553.00, on September 1, 2018;
d.    Rent
for October 2018, and $553.00, on October 1, 2018;
e.    Rent
for November 2018, and $553.00, on November 1, 2018;
f.      Rent
for December 2018, and $553.00, on December 1, 2018.
 
3.     
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments under paragraph
two, above, in full, the Landlord may collect the entire outstanding balance
from the amount set out in paragraph one, immediately. 
 
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments under paragraph two, above, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the breach,
without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant; and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears and NSF fees and
related charges that become owing after July 9, 2018.
