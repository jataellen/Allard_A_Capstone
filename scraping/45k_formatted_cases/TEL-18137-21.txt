Tuxedo Court Lp C/o Briarlane
Rental Property Mngmt (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Thineskumar Ketharanathan and Mathushan Sivakumar (the
'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring
the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 936 8115 8630#
on October 19, 2021. The Landlord’s
representative Sam Ursino
and the Landlord’s Property Manager, Anca Moldeanu, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord alleges the Tenants attempted to enter
the parking garage following another vehicle that used the fob to open the door
in front of their vehicle. When they
attempted to enter the garage,
the garage door started to close and dropped on the hood of their vehicle. As a result of the attempted entry, the
garage door sustained damage that the Landlord was required to repair.
 
2.     The Landlord provided
video footage of the attempted
entry and well as photographs of the damage to the hood of the vehicle to support this claim.
 
3.     Ms. Moldeanu testified
that the Tenants
acknowledged that it was their vehicle that was
seen causing the damage to the garage door.

was $4,636.59.
 
5.     The Tenants will be provided until February 28, 2022
to pay the Landlord the cost the Landlord incurred to repair the damage. Should the Tenants
fail to make the payment
the tenancy will be terminated.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$4,636.59 on or before February
28, 2022.
 
2.    
Should the Tenants fail to make the payment
in full and on time, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated,
as of March 1, 2022. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 1, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.
