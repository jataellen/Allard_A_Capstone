Order under Section
87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97764-21
 



In the matter
of:


A,
342 CARLETON STREET CORNWALL ON K6H4X7


 




Between:


Filippo Chiarenza


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christian Proulx


Tenant



 
 
Filippo Chiarenza (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christian Proulx (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord and their
representative, Cheryl McDonald, attended the hearing. As of 2:25 p.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Preliminary matter:
 
At the onset of the hearing
the Landlord was made aware
that the notice
of termination that had
been served to the Tenant
contained a flaw which would
render the notice
invalid. The Landlord was then provided with the option
of withdrawing the application and serving a new notice or proceeding seeking
an order for arrears only. The Landlord chose to move forward with the hearing
addressing only outstanding arrears and not termination of the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $900.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,700.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to January 31, 2022.




File Number: EAL-97764-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
