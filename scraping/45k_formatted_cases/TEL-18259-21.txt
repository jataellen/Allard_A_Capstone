Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TEL-18259-21
 



In the matter
of:


630 COUNTRY
ROAD #17 PICTON ON K0K2T0


 




Between:


Russell Head


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dean Duphette
  Jean Duphette


Tenants



 
Russell Head (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dean Duphette and Jean Duphette (the
'Tenants') because
a)    
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
b)    
they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 19, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative Dara Saunders attended
the hearing.
 
As of 10:27 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
At the hearing, the Landlord's Legal Representative advised
the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
August 31, 2021 making the L2 application to end the tenancy moot.
 
The L1 application is amended to a L9 application for an order for rent arrears owing only.
 
Determinations:
 
Relating to the L1 Application
 
1.     The Landlord filed a L1 application on December 21,
2020 because the Tenants had not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served the Tenants a N4 Notice of Termination.
 
2.     The Tenants subsequently vacated the rental
unit on August 31, 2021.
 
3.     The monthly lawful
rent was $2,200.00, and the Landlord
is holding a last month rent
deposit of $2,200.00 with interest owing from September 30, 2020.
 
4.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.




 
 
 
5.    
The Tenants did not pay any monies towards
rent after the application was filed.
 
6.     The L1.L9 Information Update form documents
the total amount
of rent arrears
owing by the Tenants to the
Landlord for the period ending August 31, 2021 is $19,800.00.
 
7.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I am
satisfied on a balance of probabilities that as of the hearing date, that the Tenants owe to the Landlord up to the rental period ending August 31, 2021,
rent arrears of $19,800.00, and the Landlords’ application cost of $201.00,
totalling $20,001.00.
 
8.     The Landlord’s Representative testified that there
were conversations between the Landlord and the Tenants about
the arrears but was unsuccessful in reaching any form of settlement or a negotiated repayment
plan with the Tenants for the amount outstanding.
 
Relating to the L2 Application
 
9.     The Landlord’s L2 application
is moot because the Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on August 31, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
was terminated effective August 31, 2021, the date the Tenants moved out of the rental unit.
 
Relating to the L2 Application
 
2.     The L2 application is dismissed.
 
Relating to the L9 Application.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$17,695.25*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     The Tenants shall pay $17,896.25* the total amount
owing to the Landlord
on or before February 13, 2022.
 
6.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.




 
7.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 13, 2022, the Landlord has the right, at any
time to collect from the Tenants the full amount owing or
any balance outstanding under this order.
