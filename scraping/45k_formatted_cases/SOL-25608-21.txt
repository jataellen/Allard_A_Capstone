468 Ottawa North Residences Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sheila Longboat and George Tilli (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sabrina Sculli, attended the hearing. As
of 9:53 a.m., the Tenants were not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 20, 2021
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 16, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,473.72.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,442.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2019 to October 20, 2021.




File Number: SOL-25608-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
16, 2021, the date the Tenants returned vacant possession of the rental
unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $800.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
16, 2021, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
March 7, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
