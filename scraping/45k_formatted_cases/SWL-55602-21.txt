properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 4, 2021.

the rental unit on January
8, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

rent was $1,350.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenancy is terminated on January 8, 2022. This is the date that the Tenant vacated
the rental unit.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$16,505.07*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 8, 2022.

The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.

the full amount owing* on or before

will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
