of:


432, 40 ASQUITH AVENUE TORONTO ON M4W1J6


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Brittany-Leigh McColman


Tenant



 
 
Toronto Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Brittany-Leigh McColman (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard via video conference on January 19, 2022. The Landlord’s agent, Dale Maingot and the Tenant
attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
June 1, 2019 to May 1, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective August 21, 2019.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on May 1, 2021. The
Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent was $1,215.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $2,025.88
after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,173.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest has already been paid on the deposit.
 
7.     There was no dispute that the Tenant owes the Landlord
arrears of rent up to May 1, 2021 ($22,984.01) and the filing
fee ($186.00), which totals $23,170.01, pursuant to the L1 update sheet.

8.    
As I stated at the hearing,
the total amount
will be decreased
by the last month’s rent deposit of $1,173.00.
 
9.     As such, the total the Tenant owes to the Landlord is $21,997.01. An order will issue for this amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of May 1, 2021, the
date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $21,997.01, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to May 1, 2021,
the application filing fee, and less the rent
deposit.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
February 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
