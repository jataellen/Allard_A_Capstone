the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lidia Cruz, attended the hearing. As of 2:54 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from

of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 20, 2021.

of $725.00 from the Tenant

5.     The Tenant paid $725.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
December 31, 2021. The Tenant
