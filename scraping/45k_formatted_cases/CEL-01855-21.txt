In the matter
of:


9 HAWKINS COURT BRAMPTON ON L6S2N7


 




Between:


Balwinder Singh Chahal Jatinder Kaur Chahal


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Anthony
Brigmohan Chantel Brigmohan


Tenants



 
 
 
Balwinder Singh
Chahal and Jatinder Kaur Chahal (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Chantel Brigmohan and Anthony Brigmohan (the 'Tenants')
because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 23, 2021. The Landlord, Balwinder Singh Chahal, was represented by
Ian Gardiner. The Tenant, Chantel
Brigmohan, attended and was represented by Saurabh Singhal.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is based on a Notice to End the Tenancy
(N8) because the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent
on the date it was due, served on the Tenants July 21, 2021 with a termination
date of September 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The tenancy
is month to month.
 
3.    
Rent is due on the first
day of the month. For the year 2021, the rent was paid piecemeal on the following dates: January
(paid 1, 4 and 7), February (paid 1 and 9), March (1, 2, and 12), April (1, 3,
9 and 16), May (1, 2, and 13), June (1, 2 and 13), July (2 and 6).
 
4.    
The Tenant does not dispute the late payments.
She and her husband were/are
getting divorced and she struggled financially but she states
she is currently in a better financial position to pay the rent on
time going forward. The Tenant
resides with her dependent brother. The
Tenant is seeking relief from eviction.
 
5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: CEL-01855-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord’s application for eviction
is denied on the condition
that the Tenants,
for a period of twelve months
from the date of the order, pay the rent on time and in full.
 
2.   
 If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph
1, and by the dates required, then the Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make the application
within 30 days of a breach of the condition set out in paragraph 1 of this
order.
