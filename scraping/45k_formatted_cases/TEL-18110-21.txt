Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18110-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


565
  CHAMBERLAIN STREET PETERBOROUGH ON K9J4L6


 




Between:


David Griffin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tracy Kennedy


Tenant



 
 
 
David Griffin (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tracy Kennedy (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard on January
18, 2022. The Landlord’s representative Debbie Mackie attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has stored a hot tub, gazebo and other items in the driveway. The Tenant
signed an agreement to allow the Tenant in the neighbouring unit to parking in
the driveway located beside her unit. The items stored in the driveway are
preventing the neighbour to park in the driveway.
 
2.    
The Tenant is storing
items on the rear deck which need to be removed. There is excess clutter in the basement preventing
access to the furnace.
 
3.     I find the Tenant is substantially interfering with the reasonable enjoyment of other tenants and the Landlord’s lawful
right, privilege or interest.
 
4.     Under the circumstances I find it fair to grant relief from eviction
with conditions as set out below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     On or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant shall ensure
the driveway is free from items that interfere with the neighbour’s ability to park in the driveway; ensure
the deck is kept
free of excess items stored on the deck; and shall ensure that the basement is
free of excess items that interfere with the Landlord’s ability to perform
routine maintenance.

2.    
In the event the Tenant fails to comply
with the terms as set out above the Landlord
shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a
breach of this Order, without notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.
