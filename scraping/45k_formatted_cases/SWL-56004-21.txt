Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56004-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


205, 306 CARLING
STREET EXETER ON N0M1S2


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jason Becking


Tenant



 
 
 
Amiraco
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Jason Becking (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 31, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal representative, J. Lapkowski, attended the hearing. As of
10:59 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenant persistently failed to pay
rent when it was due. The Landlord served on the Tenant an N8 notice to
terminate on September 17, 2021.
 
2.   
Rent is due on the first of each month.
 
3.    As per the N8 Notice, the Tenant had not paid rent in
full by the first of the month twelve times in twelve months.
 
4.   
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
5.    I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
6.    The Landlord requested that the Tenant be ordered
to pay the rent in full and on time. I find this relief to be appropriate in the
circumstances.

It is
ordered that:

that:
a)    
The Tenant shall pay the full

and for 12 months thereafter up to and including February 1, 2023.
 
2.    If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set
out in paragraph 1 above, then, within 30 days of the breach,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 1 of this order.

Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
