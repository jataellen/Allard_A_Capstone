Review Order
 
S.A.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.I.
and I.M (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was resolved by order TEL-89226-18 issued on May 4, 2018 and
amended on May 17, 2018.
 
On May 16, 2018, the second-named Tenant above requested a review
of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On
the basis of the submissions made in the request and for the reasons that
follow, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that a
serious error occurred in the proceedings or that the Tenants were not
reasonably able to participate.
2.     By
way of background, when this application came before the Board on April 11,
2018, the Landlord and the first-named Tenant were present. It appears from the
record that the Tenant who attended did not seek an adjournment so the other
Tenant could attend. 
3.     The
only dispute at the hearing was the issue of relief from eviction. The Landlord
wanted an eviction order. The Tenants wanted until April 30, 2018 to pay the
rent arrears owing. 
4.     On
an application for eviction for rent arrears the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') does not permit the Board to simply order an eviction with
no opportunity to pay and stay. Pursuant to s. 74(3) the Board is mandatorily
required to give the Tenants some time to void any eviction order to preserve
their tenancy. The order as amended correctly states this.
5.     So
the real issue before the Board at the hearing was with respect to s. 83(1) of
the Act which says:
Upon an application for an
order evicting a tenant, the Board may, despite any other provision of this Act
or the tenancy agreement,
(a)       refuse to grant
the application unless satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that
it would be unfair to refuse; or
(b)       order that the
enforcement of the eviction order be postponed for a period of time.  
6.     After
canvassing the circumstances of both parties the Board determined it would be
unfair to grant relief beyond the Board’s normal eleven day pay and stay order.
Partly this was because of the delay in issuing the order. The delay resulted
in the Tenants being given more than a month; they had until May 15, 2018 to
repay the rent arrears owing. 
7.     The
request for review essentially argues the decision should be reviewed because
only one Tenant was present at the hearing and the absent Tenant is the
“primary income earner” and the Board failed to take into account all of the
Tenants’ circumstances concerning their income and their four year old child. 
8.     Reviews
are intended to address errors made by the Board and to ensure that parties
have the right to attend and participate in the hearing. 
9.     With
respect to the first of the Tenant’s arguments, namely that the order should be
reviewed because the “primary income earner” was not present, that cannot be
the basis for a review. 
10.  The
Tenants knew about the hearing. They decided on their own who would attend and
who would not according to their own schedules and needs. That is actually
normal. Most busy families cannot organise their time and work so that multiple
named tenants can all attend. It is commonplace for them to choose who can
attend on behalf of all. That is what happened here.  If it was important for
the second-named Tenant to attend the Tenants could have asked the Landlord for
consent to reschedule or sought adjournment at the hearing. There is nothing in
the record or in the review to indicate that the Tenants did either. So it
simply cannot be said the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in
the hearing. 
11.  With
respect to the argument that the Board failed to accurately take into account
all of the Tenants’ circumstances and should have granted other or further
relief, the record indicates the Board essentially granted the relief sought by
delaying the issuance of the order. 
12.  More
importantly, discretionary decisions with respect to relief from eviction will
not be the subject of a review unless the decision falls outside the normal
reasonable range of outcomes. (See the Board’s Interpretation Guideline # 8
Review of an Order.) The Tenants were given more than a month from the hearing
date to repay the rent arrears. Given the evidence of the Landlord with respect
to the hardship being caused by the Tenants’ non-payment it simply cannot be
said the decision was unreasonable.
13.  As a
result, the Tenants’ request for review must be denied. I am not satisfied that
there is a serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings or that the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate.
14.  This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review order TEL-89226-18 issued on May 4, 2018 and amended on May
17, 2018 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
