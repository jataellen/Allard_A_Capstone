and


 




 


Susanna Clinton


Tenant



 
 
Direct Properties C/O Grant Mgt Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Susanna Clinton
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Jeff Shabes, attended the hearing. As of 9:24 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The Landlord's representative advised
that he had discussed the proposed terms
of the order as set out below with the Tenant prior to the hearing
and that she was agreeable to them. He said it was his understanding that the Tenant
was not present at the hearing because she knew these were the terms he was
going to request and she was in agreement with them. The Tenant may request a
review of this order if these are not the terms she agreed to.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
28, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,650.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $6,600.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022,
inclusive of rent arrears ($1,650.00) and costs ($186.00), is $1,836.00.
