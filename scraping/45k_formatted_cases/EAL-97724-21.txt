Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97724-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


204, 1026
LAURIER RUE E ROCKLAND ON K4K1V6


 




Between:


Jean Maisonneuve
  Chantal Charlebois


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Bernard Dion Julie
Deslauriers


Tenants



 
 
 
Jean Maisonneuve and Chantal
Charlebois (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Julie
Deslauriers and Bernard
Dion (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlords attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective January
1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,095.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from December 15, 2014, to January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the pandemic and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $7,761.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022,
less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$38.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)$9,464.32 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or ii)$10,634.52 if the payment is
made on or before March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
