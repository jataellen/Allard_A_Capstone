Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Katie Presley


Tenant



 
 
Clint Senack and Sandra Senack (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Katie
Presley (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord, Sandra
Senack, attended the hearing. As of 1:33 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective August 25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on September
1, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,000.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 10, 2020 to August 25, 2021.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of September
1, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: EAL-97323-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $51.05*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
1, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 26,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
