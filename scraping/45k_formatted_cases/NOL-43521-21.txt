Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43521-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


807, 263 BRADY STREET SUDBURY ON P3B4A6


 




Between:


Kaymic Developments (ontario) Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Melissa Monpetit


Tenant



 
 
 
Kaymic
Developments (ontario) Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Melissa Monpetit (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 22, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative L. Britt, and the Landlord’s agents P. Restoule,
N. Houle and
C. St. Jean attended
the hearing. The Tenant did not attend the hearing,
although properly served with
the Notice of Hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L2
application was filed August 5, 2021, and alleges the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage
to the rental unit or residential complex; and the
Tenant’s behaviour has substantially interfered with other tenants’ or the
Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and/or lawful
rights, privileges, or interests.
Form N5
 
2.    
The Landlord’s
Form N5 contains a termination date of August 20,2020 and a service date of
August 4, 2020.
 
3.    
Since this is the
second N5 served by the Landlord in the past 6 months, it is not voidable.




 
4.    
For the reasons
below, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment and/or lawful rights,
privileges or interests.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s agent testified that on July 27, 28 and 29 the Tenant
defaced and/or wrote on the Landlord’s laundry room sign and exterior “no
parking/smoking” signs, and took down the Landlord’s “masks are mandatory”
signs located at the front entrance of the residential complex. The Landlord tendered a picture evidence
showing the Tenant writing on the laundry room sign as well as picture and
video evidence of the Tenant writing on the “no parking/smoking” signs.
 
6.    
As a result of
the Tenant’s actions, the Landlord has had to replace the “masks are mandatory”
signs to comply with local public health guidelines. Further, the Landlord has had to wipe down the exterior bench
and “no parking/smoking” signs where the Tenant had written with markers.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s agent
also testified that upon confronting the Tenant on July 29,
2021, the Tenant began swearing
and yelling at the Landlord’s property manager in the hallway
and lobby area of the residential complex. The Landlord tendered two videos showing the Tenant, in plain
sight of other residents, swearing at the Landlord, making accusations about
the Landlord, and yelling at the Landlord’s agent: “you’re dirt”. The videos
show a blatant refusal on the part of the Tenant to acknowledge any wrongdoing or willingness to change.
 
8.    
I find the
defacing and removing of the Landlord’s signs, in combination with the yelling
and insults directed at the Landlord once confronted, substantially interferes
with the Landlord’s ability to manage the rental complex.  By repeatedly defacing and/or removing signage intended for the benefit
of residents and required by local public health guidelines/regulations, and
more significantly, failing to show any willingness to change, I find that the
Tenant’s conduct rises to a level of severity to constitute substantial inference.
 
9.    
While the
Landlord was certainly inconvenienced by the Tenant’s actions, I do not find
that the damage on its own was “undue” since the signs could be cleaned and/or
replaced. This portion of the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
10. 
Section 83 requires that I consider
all the circumstances, including
the Tenants’ and the Landlord’s situations to determine if it would be appropriate
to grant section 83 relief
from eviction. The Landlord indicated that the yelling, as well as graffiti and
defacing of signs has gone on for some time.
The Landlord is not aware of any children living at the rental unit and
has indicated that the Tenant is on ODSP. I
have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act and find




 
that it would not be unfair to delay eviction until March 31, 2022
pursuant to section 83 of the Act. I
note that the Tenants did not attend the hearing, and thus did not provide any
evidence that may be relevant to my determination under s. 83.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31, 2022.
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
