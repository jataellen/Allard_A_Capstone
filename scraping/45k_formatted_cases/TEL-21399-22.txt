Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21399-22



In the matter
of:


14, 300 MONTRAVE AVENUE OSHAWA ON L1J4S2


 




Between:


Lanmark Management Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Howard Mattis


 
Tenant



 
 
Lanmark Management Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Howard Mattis (the 'Tenant') and
for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 13,
2021 with respect to application TEL-18405-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord filed
the application more than 30 days after
the Tenant failed
to meet the condition specified in the Order.
 
2.     Order TEL-18405-21 sets out a payment plan, which
required the Tenant to make payments toward arrears
and rent over a period
ending November 30, 2021.
The Order also included a
provision that if the Tenant breached the payment plan, the Landlord could
apply to the Board, under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”) for an eviction order without notice to the Tenant.
 
3.     Subsection 78(5) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”) requires that any application made under section
78 be made not later than 30 days after the failure
of a tenant to meet any such
condition in the previous order.
 
4.     The Landlord filed this L4 Application on January 26,
2022. In the Declaration that was filed with the application, the Landlord
states that contrary to order TEL-18405-21 the Tenant paid $600.00 on October 12, 2021; $400.00
on October 25, 2021; and $650.00 on November 4, 2021.
 
5.     The problem is that more than 30 days have passed
since the date of the last required payment,
which was to take place on November
25, 2021. Therefore, this L4 Application is statute-barred by
limitation.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
