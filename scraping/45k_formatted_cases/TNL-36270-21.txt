Order under
Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TNL-36270-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
78 MADISON HEIGHTS BOULEVARD MARKHAM ON L6C2E3


 




Between:


Pu Shen


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dorrette Slowley


Tenant



 
 
 
Pu Shen (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dorrette
Slowley (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on August 3, 2021 with respect to application
TNL-31637-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the full arrears
as prescribed in the Order, by the due date of November 12, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$2,682.65 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-31637-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is
$753.89 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order TNL-31637-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent arrears that became
owing for the period from August 13, 2021, to November 12, 2021, 2021.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order TNL-31637-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated as of January
11, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 22, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $753.89*. (less any amount paid to the Landlords after this
application was filed on November 18, 2021).
This amount represents the rent owing up to January
11, 2022, and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$61.57 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 12, 2022, to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 23, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
 
8.       
The tenant has until January 21, 2022, to file a motion
with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
21, 2022, the order will be stayed, and the Board
will schedule a hearing.
 
 
9.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 23,
2022, if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
