Order under Section 69 and 89
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80169-17
 










 
 
 

MD.
D.H. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.C.
W. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant and because
he, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises (the ‘L2 application’). The Landlord has also applied for an
order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage (the
‘Damage Claim’). The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on June 2, 2017, and August 4, 2017.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative, A.K.D., and the
Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant called as a witness is friend, M.M.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application 
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2017 to August 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 22, 2017.
2.      The
notice of termination was served and signed on April 7, 2017, but it failed to
claim April’s rent. 
3.      Subsection
59(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), says “the notice of termination shall set out the amount of rent due…”.
As the notice of termination fails to properly set out the amount of rent due
and fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Act, it is invalid. 
4.      At
the hearing, as the notice of termination was found to be invalid, the Landlord
elected to pursue an order for arrears only.  
The
Damage Claim  
5.      At
the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw the
portion of the application concerning the alleged wilful or negligent damage as
well as the damage claim pursuant to section 89 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’),
6.      In
accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’), I consent to the withdrawal of these portions of the Landlord application. 

The
L2 Application 
7.      The
Landlord says that the Tenant has substantially interfered with his lawful
right, privilege or interest because he has refused to move a red van from the
driveway and he has refused to clean his garbage from the back yard. 
8.      The
Landlord says that he has already received an order from the City by-law
enforcement and he has been given a deadline of September 29, 2017, to remove
the vehicle and clean up the yard or the Landlord will be penalized with a
fine. 
9.      The
Tenant says that he was storing the red van for a friend because he mistakenly
believed that he had access to the entire driveway. However, after seeing the
lease agreement at the hearing which clearly specifies that he only has access
to one parking spot, he has agreed to have the vehicle removed as soon as
possible. 
10.   At
the hearing, the Landlord admitted that not all of the garbage in the yard
belongs to the Tenant. The parties reviewed the Landlord’s colour photographs
of the yard and the Tenant circled all of the articles that belong to him. 
11.   Based
on all of the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant has interfered
with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest contrary to section 64
of the Act by refusing to remove the red van from the driveway and the garbage
from the yard. 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the
conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act. 
13.   At
the hearing, the Tenant appeared ready and willing to remove the van and his
articles from the yard. As a result, it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction, subject to the Landlord’s right to pursue an eviction if the
Tenant fails to remove the van and the garbage in a timely manner. An order
will issue accordingly. 
It
is ordered that:
The
L1 Application 
1.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,590.00 for arrears of rent up to and
including August 31, 2017, and the cost of filing the application. 
2.      If
the Tenant fails to pay to the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August
26, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 27, 2017, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
The
L2 Application 
3.      The
Tenant shall remove the red van from the driveway on or before August 31, 2017.

4.      The
Tenant shall also remove all of his refuse, garbage or other articles from the
back yard on or before August 31, 2017. 
5.     
If the Tenant fails to adhere to the conditions set out in
paragraphs 3 or 4 of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the
Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this
application no later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
 
The
Damage Claim
6.      The
Landlord’s damage claim is dismissed as withdrawn.
