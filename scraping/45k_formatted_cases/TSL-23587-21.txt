In the matter
of:


117, 550 KINGSTON ROAD
EAST TORONTO ON M4E3V6


 




Between:


Mainstay Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jared Cameau


Tenant



 
 
Mainstay Housing
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jared Cameau (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on November 16, 2021 at 11:59am.
Only the Landlord’s agent, Ben Kershaw, attended the hearing.
Also in attendance was the Landlord’s witness Robert Odong.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
By way of background, this is a month-to-month tenancy
in which the lawful monthly
rent is $115.00. the rental unit is a bachelor unit located in a 7-floor
building with 120 units.
 
2.     As of the hearing date, the Tenant
remains in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a N7 notice of termination served to the Tenant
on July 28, 2021 with a termination date of August 24, 2021 pursuant to
subsection 66(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 which states:
 
66 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
 
(a)  
an act or omission of the tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex
by the tenant seriously impairs
or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and
 
(b)  
the act or omission
occurs in the residential complex.
 
4.     BK testified that it was reported to the Landlord, by
two housing support workers that on July 14, 2021,
they heard screaming
from the lobby. Since they were in the management office, they went to the lobby
to investigate and found the Tenant holding a bloody




 
baseball bat and the victim bleeding
from the left side of the head. Police were called and the Tenant was arrested the same day.
 
5.    
Since this incident, a further
incident took place on October
30, 2021 where
the Tenant approached
security, asking for needles. When security refused to provide the Tenant with
needles, the Tenant became hostile and began to yell at the security guard,
attempting to hit him. Security had to lock himself up in his office to save
him from the Tenant’s belligerent conduct.
 
6.    
The Tenant’s
conduct raises serious
safety concern for the tenants
and staff residing
and working at the premises; the building is composed of a vulnerable
population who each have a supporting housing worker visiting them regularly.
The incident in October 2021 was on an individual employed by the Landlord
whose role is to assist residents and manage the safety and security of the
residential premises.
 
7.     The Landlord’s witness, RO, is employed as the
Tenant’s housing support worker; he testified that when he spoke to the Tenant
about the incident on July 14, 2021, the Tenant explained that he was defending
himself; it was unclear from whom and what happened. Further, the Tenant told
him that the police had charged him on the spot but let him go later
as no charges were being pressed
by the victim. RO indicated that he did not have a
chance to speak with the Tenant about the incident on October 30, 2021 as the
Tenant hasn’t been responsive.
 
8.    
As such,
the Landlord seeks a termination of the tenancy
and reimbursement of the
application filing fee.
 
ANALYSIS
 
9.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence, I find
that the Tenant has seriously impaired the safety
of another person by assaulting another resident of the premises.
I find that this act occurred in the residential complex.
 
10.  Since the N7 notice of termination was served, a further incident took place in
October 2021. As such, I do not find it appropriate to grant relief from
eviction and issue a conditional order as the Tenant’s
behaviour has only escalated, based
on the evidence provided by the Landlord. Further, it appears the
Tenant is no longer responsive to his housing support worker.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
12.   This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
August 24, 2019. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022,
then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt of this order, the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement
of this order.
