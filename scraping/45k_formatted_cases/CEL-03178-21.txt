Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03178-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 1286 QUEEN STREET
WEST BRAMPTON ON L6X0B2


 




Between:


2803832 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kortney Browne Scott Baverstock


Tenants



 
 
 
2803832 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kortney Browne
and Scott Baverstock (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe, and because the
Tenants have been persistently late paying rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
27, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Bita De Lisi, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 23, 2021.
2. 
3.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
4. 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 23, 2020 to September 23, 2021.
6. 
7.    
The Tenant have been persistently late paying rent. 8.
9.    The Landlord’s representative
requested an order that provides the Tenants an opportunity to void the arrears
order and maintain the tenancy by paying rent on time going forward. I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction as requested pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: CEL-03178-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
Part “A”: Non-Payment of Rent:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$17,373.07*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 11, 2022, then starting February
12, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$21,201.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)         
$23,301.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
Part “B”: Persistently Late Payment of Rent
 
10.  The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing March 2022 and continuing through

11.  In the event the Tenants fail to make the above said payment
in full and on time, the entire balance of the amount
set out in this Order will become
due and payable
forthwith under this Order. The
Landlord shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order, without notice
to the Tenants, for an Order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and for any arrears that become due after the date
