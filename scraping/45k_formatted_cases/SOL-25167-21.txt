Loretta Mezei


Tenant



 
D.D. Acquisitions Partnership
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Loretta
Mezei (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Gail
Kukor Lang, attended the hearing. As of 2:46 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
12, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,624.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,624.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from April 2, 2021 to
September 29, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of December 12, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-25167-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $4,455.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
12, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
