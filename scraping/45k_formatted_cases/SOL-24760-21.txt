Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24760-21



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 109 PARK AVENUE
  BRANTFORD ON N3S5H7


 




Between:


Brandon Cruz


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Jessica
Hodder Lesley Lamb


 
Tenants



 
 
Brandon Cruz (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jessica Hodder and Lesley
Lamb (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. The Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 15, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
At the hearing, a
preliminary issue arose with respect to the validity of the N4 Notice of
Termination (‘N4 notice’). This relates to the amount of rent due for the
rental periods claimed on the N4 notice.
 
6.    
The general
requirements for a valid notice of termination are set out in section 43 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). One requirement is that the
notice “shall set out the reasons and details respecting the termination”. The
specific requirements for an N4 notice are set out in section
43(2) of the Act, one of which is to “set out the reasons
and details respecting the termination”. The notice of termination did
not include any rent amounts for the rental periods.

7.    
Consequently, the only part of the application that proceeded was the claim for rent arrears.
As a result, the order will be limited to rent arrears and costs only, not
eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $7,500.00, which represents the amount of rent owing up to
December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
