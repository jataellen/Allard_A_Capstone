Robert Gilchrist (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Destinee Payne and Dema Campbell (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January

attended the hearing. As of
10:13 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
January 4, 2022. The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,082.84 as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $950.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 2, 2015 to
December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $1,070.00
after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
January 4, 2022. The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.

2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,303.47*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
