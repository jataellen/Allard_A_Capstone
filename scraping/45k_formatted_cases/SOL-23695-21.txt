of:


107, 20 TREMONT
DRIVE
ST. CATHARINES ON L2T3B1


 




Between:


Squire Apartments Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ashley Dalcourt Benjamin Robida


Tenants



 
 
 
Squire Apartments Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Benjamin
Robida and Ashley Dalcourt (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe (‘L1 Application’). The Landlord also applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October
27, 2021. Only the Landlord’s agent, David Rootham, attended the
hearing. As of 9:40 a.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord was no longer seeking
an eviction order as the Tenants had vacated the rental unit prior to the hearing.
 
L1 Application
 
2.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required
to pay for the period from May 1, 2020 to August 21,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 15, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on August 21, 2021.
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit when this
application was filed.
 
4.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,528.00.
 
5.    
The Tenants made no payments
after this application was filed.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,495.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2019 to
May 15, 2021.
 
L2 Application
 
1.    
Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17 (‘Act’,) states the
following:
 
A landlord may apply to the
Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord
has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of
damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a
person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or
negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex
and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
2.    
The Landlord alleged that the Tenants
caused the following undue damages to the rental unit or residential complex:
 
a.    Broken security glass of two interior doors;
b.    Damaged hallway emergency light;
c.    Damaged and stained
floors;
d.    Changed looking mechanism;
e.    Damaged outside south
entrance building door;
f.     Damaged suite entrance
door;
g.    Damaged entrance closet door;
h.    Damaged bathroom towel
bar;
i.      Damaged main
bathroom door and frame;
j.      Damaged and chipped
main bathtub;
k.    Damaged soap dish;
l.     
Damaged hallway closet door;
m.  Damaged bedroom closet door;
n.    Damaged two bedroom
doors;
o.    Three missing window
restrictors in bedrooms;
p.    Damaged wall in the
master bedroom;
q.    Damaged window pane frame in the
master bedroom;
r.     Damaged faceplate on a living room outlet;
s.    Damaged kitchen countertop; and




 
t.    
Damaged kitchen cupboards.
3.    
The Landlord’s application claimed
$4,672.79 in costs
to repair or replace the damaged
items in the rental unit. This claim
was supported by quotes and invoices totalling more than the amount claimed.
 
4.    
The Landlord testified that the
nature of the damage was well beyond normal wear and tear and that it was caused by the Tenants. The Landlords’ testimony was supported by photographs. The photographs showed the
damage and were consistent with the Landlord’s testimony about the nature and
the cause of the damage. I found the Landlord’s testimony to be credible and
reliable.
 
5.    
Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board, on the balance
of probabilities, I find that the Tenants
have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage throughout the residential unit and that this damage is undue.
 
6.    
On the uncontested evidence
before the Board,
I find that the Landlord
has incurred costs and will incur future costs of $4,672.79 to repair the damage to the
rental unit and replace the garage
door.
 
8.    The
Landlord has incurred
the cost of $201.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated effective August 21,
2021, the date the Tenants vacated the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,080.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 21, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
L2 Application
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,672.79, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
Total
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
The Total amount that the Tenants
owe the Landlord under the L1 and the L2 components is $8,954.10. The Tenants shall pay this amount to the Landlord
on or before February 6, 2022.




 
6.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
