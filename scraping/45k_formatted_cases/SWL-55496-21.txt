Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55496-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
103, 760
WONDERLAND ROAD S LONDON ON N6K1M2


 




Between:


Hazelview Property Services Inc


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Wai Jone Leung


Tenant



 
 
Hazelview Property Services Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wai Jone Leung (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Rosanna Pighetti, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Gail Kukor Lang,
attended the hearing. As of 10:56 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of
January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$1,010.76.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $977.28 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $4,809.78
after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until DATE pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:

Unless the Tenant voids the order

As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears

3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$33.23 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit, and
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the
other any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 24, 2022, then starting
February 25, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 25, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant
must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  
$1,010.76 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)  
$2,021.52 if the payment
is made on or before February 24, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph
and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 25, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
