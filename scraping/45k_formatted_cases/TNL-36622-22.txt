Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36622-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


717, 1 FOUNTAINHEAD ROAD TORONTO ON M3J1K6


 




Between:


Ranee Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cliff Mbeche Osoro Esther Nyancher Ondati


Tenants



 
 
 
Ranee Management (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Cliff Mbeche Osoro
and Esther Nyancher
Ondati (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on September 13, 2021 with respect to
application TNL-33392-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the
Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $700.00 arrears
on or before January 10, 2022. The Tenants did not pay $1534.65 rent on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $5,466.67 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-33392-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $4,166.67 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-33392-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,534.65 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
February 22, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-33392-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $9,879.08*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 22, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$50.45 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
 
 
February 22, 2022

The tenant has until March 4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If
the tenant files the motion by March 4, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on September 6, 2022
if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court

unit is located.
