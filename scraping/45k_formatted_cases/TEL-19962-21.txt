Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19962-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 63 SHILTON
ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1S2J8


 




Between:


Wenbo Tian Yi Hong Han


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Takeyce Mais


Tenant



 
 
 
Wenbo Tian and Yi Hong Han (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Takeyce
Mais (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the
damage.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022.
 
Only Wenbo Tian, on behalf of the
Landlords attended the hearing. As of 12:15 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons
that follow, I find that the notice
to terminate the tenancy
because the the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant is fatally
flawed, and therefore, not valid. Since the notice is not valid, the Landlord’s
application cannot be granted.
 
2.     This application is based on section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states:
 
(1)  A
landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person
permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it
substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially
interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or
another tenant.

(2)   A notice
of termination under subsection (1) shall,
(a)  provide a
termination date not earlier than the 20th day after the notice is given;
(b) 
set out the grounds for termination; and
(c) 
require the tenant,
within seven days, to stop the conduct
or activity or correct
the omission set out in the notice.
 
(3)   The notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within
seven days after receiving the
notice, stops the conduct or activity or corrects the omission. [Emphasis added]
 
3.     Here, the notice of termination is dated September 8,
2021 and the termination date in the notice is September 8, 2021. Therefore,
the notice does not comply with section 64(2)(a) of the Act and the application must be dismissed. An order will issue
for same.
 
4.     This order contains
all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
