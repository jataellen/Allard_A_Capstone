Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21375-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


12,
  40 MAPLE STREET UXBRIDGE ON L9P 1C9


 




Between:


Cedar Range
Management Incorporated


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danny Canning


Tenant



 
 
Cedar Range Management
Incorporated (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danny Canning (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June
23, 2021 with respect to application TEL-13532-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain
condition specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the
Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The
Tenant did not pay $800.00
(1st installment of January 2022 monthly rent) on
or before January 7, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or
all the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$6,179.43 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-13532-20. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $ 1,152.88 and that
amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
TEL-13532-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $909.87
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-13532-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,180.39* (less any amounts the Tenant has paid to the Landlord since the application was
filed on January 19, 2022). This amount represents the rent owing
up to January 31, 2022 and the costs
related to the application
fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $30.43
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
