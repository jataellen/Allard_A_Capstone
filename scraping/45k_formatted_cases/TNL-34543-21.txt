In the
  matter of:


1, 34 GARTHDALE COURT TORONTO ON M3H5P8


 




Between:


Majlinda Bregu
  Petrit Bregu


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Joshua Ghanei Rebekah Ghanei


Tenants



 
 
 
Majlinda Bregu and Petrit Bregu
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Joshua Ghanei and Rebekah Ghanei (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1); and because they, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant; and because they or
another occupant of the rental unit have committed an illegal act or have
carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental
unit or the residential
complex (L2). The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. The Landlords,
represented by Sergey Bogdanov, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 27, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,150.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
1, 2020 to August 27, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $1,150.00 after the application was filed.




File Number: TNL-34543-21
 
5.    
The N5 notice served
on the Tenants alleges the Tenants changed
the locking system on
the door and has not provided the Landlord with a key. At the hearing the Landlords confirmed they have not received a
key to new locking mechanism as required under section 35 of the Residential
Tenancies Act. The Tenants will
be ordered to provide the Landlords with a key to the locking mechanism on the
door.
 
6.     The N6 notice alleges
the Tenants committed an illegal act. The Landlords
testified that the Tenants
left items in the hallway and were advised that they would be removed to clear
the passageway. When the Landlords
started to remove the items left in the hallway, the Landlords testified that
Rebekah Ghanei grabbed the Landlord Majlinda Bregu by the ankle when she was on
the stairs and push her. A video
introduced as evidence from outside the rental complex
when Ms Ghanei and the Landlords exited
the building, shows the Landlord Majlinda Bregu throwing what appears to
be a child’s bike against the fence. In response
to throwing the child’s bike Ms. Bregu push Ms. Gregu in the back. The Landlord alleges that this constitutes an illegal act.
 
7.     Board Guideline 9 provides direction what constitutes an illegal act. The term “illegal” is not defined in the Residential
Tenancies Act, but would include a serious violation of a federal,
provincial or municipal law If the
illegality is trivial or technical, the or might not be considered to be
serious enough to warrant eviction. As
well, an illegal act will be considered to be serious if it has the potential
to affect the character of the premises.
 
8.     I find, based on the evidence, that the act claimed by the Landlord
to be illegal and warrants
eviction, not to meet the criteria as set out in Guideline 9.
 
9.     Regarding the (L1) application, I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
 
10.  Regarding the (L2) application, the Tenants will be provided
relief from eviction
on the condition they provide
a key to the Landlords.
 
It is ordered that:
 
Part “A”: Non-Payment of Rent
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $5,540.48*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $37.81 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.




File Number: TNL-34543-21
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$7,101.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$8,251.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make
full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
 
Part “B”: Substantial Interference with the Landlords’ Lawful Rights
 
10.  Should the Tenant void Part “A” of this order,
the Tenants shall
provide the Landlord
with a key to the locking system on or before February 5, 2022.
 
11.  In the event the Tenants
fail to comply
with the condition
as set out in paragraph
10, the Landlords shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30
days after a breach of this Order, without notice to the
Tenants, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, pursuant
to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
