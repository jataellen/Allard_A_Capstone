  matter of:


B, 7232
FRANKTOWN ROAD RICHMOND ON
  K0A2Z0


 




Between:


Jean O’Connor


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Justin Cronier Shirley Piepers


Tenants



 
 
Jean O’Connor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Shirley Piepers and Justin Cronier (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
2:42 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On September 21, 2021 the Landlord served the Tenants
with an N4 notice for termination of the tenancy for non-payment of rent. The termination date in the notice is September 28, 2021.
 
2.     At the hearing,
the Landlord testified
that she did in fact serve the Tenants with the N4 notice on September 21, 2021.
 
3.     On September 29, 2021 the Landlord filed their L1 application claiming
rent arrears from August 1, 2021 to September 29,
2021.
 
4.    
At the onset of the hearing,
the Landlord testified
that this is a monthly
tenancy and that the rental period runs from the first
day of the month to the last day of the month.
 
5.     Under subsection 59(1)(b)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’), an N4 must
have a termination date at least 14 days from when it was served. What this means is that a landlord must provide tenants with a minimum
of 14 days notice in order to have a valid N4 notice.
 
6.     It was the Landlord’s evidence
that they served
the Tenants on September 21, 2021 with the notice. Since the termination date in the notice was for September 28, 2021, I found




File Number: EAL-97916-21
 
that the N4 notice
was defective on its face for only providing 7 days notice
to the Tenants.
 
7.    
I inquired with the Landlord as to whether or not she
wanted to withdraw her L1
application and serve a new N4 notice or whether
she wanted to proceed on an
application for arrears only without an order terminating the tenancy.
 
8.     On reflection by the Landlord, she changed her
testimony to indicate that this was actually
a weekly tenancy
and that the rent is due and charged weekly
and that I should
still consider terminating the tenancy based on the notice.
 
9.    
When we explored the notice on the
weekly rent amount, the rent amounts charged and the periods for the rent
amounts did not add up. The Landlord
attempted to change her testimony on the rent charged
again to indicate
that it is actually a daily tenancy
and that the rent is charged
per day.
 
10.  I reject this testimony as uncredible, and instead
accept the Landlord’s original testimony that
this is a monthly tenancy.
She only changed
her position in that regard
upon realizing it was adverse
to her ability to obtain termination of the tenancy.
 
11.  I find the Landlord’s N4 notice fails to mee the requirements of the Act, and is therefore
defective. I am dismissing the Landlord’s application.
 
12.  These are all the reasons
contained in this order and no further
reasons shall follow.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
