Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26892-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


15, 25 TOWERCREST DRIVE HAMILTON ON L9A5H9


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christine Elliott


Tenant



 
 
 
Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christine Elliott (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent she owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 19, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-24109-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order. The Tenant failed to the lawful monthly rent
for January 2022 which was due on or before January 01, 2022 and also failed
to pay the arrears installment of $515.30 which
was due on or before January
22, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $5,153.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SOL-24109-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,921.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-24109-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26892-22
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-24109-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $4,063.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 15, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $37.55 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 16, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 26, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 27, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 26, 2022, then starting February
27, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.

The tenant has until February
25, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 25, 2022
the order will be stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 27, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
