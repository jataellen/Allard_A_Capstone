Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12911-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


404, 85 DUKE STREET WEST KITCHENER ON N2H0B7


 




Between:


Chance Moran
  Lori Moran


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Angela Castro Marini Lutfi Zablah
Rita Castro Marini


Tenants



 
 
 
On February 8, 2022, Chance
Moran and Lori Moran
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Angela
Castro Marini, Lutfi Zablah and Rita Casto Marini (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
March 18, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 18, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 18, 2022, then starting
March 19, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 19, 2022.
