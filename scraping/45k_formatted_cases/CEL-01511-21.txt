In the matter
of:


1337
  HWY 11 S KILWORTHY ON P0E1G0


 




Between:


Anthony Andres
Corona Garcia


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Douglas King


Tenant



 
 
 
Anthony Andres
Corona Garcia (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kathleen Garcia
and Richard Douglas
King (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants’ behaviour, or the behaviour of someone
visiting or living with the Tenants has substantially interfered with
the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and/or lawful
rights, privileges, or interests. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for
damage caused by the Tenants.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 4, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s agent Kathleen
Garcia and the Tenant Richard Douglas
King attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On June 11, 2021, the Landlord
served a first Form N5 on the Tenants pursuant
to s. 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), which sets out particulars and details of the Landlord’s allegations that the Tenant’s
behaviour has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment
of the residential complex and/or lawful rights, privileges, or interests
 
2.    
On June 28, 2021 the
Landlord served a second Form N5 pursuant to 68(1) of the
Act. A notice served pursuant to
s.68(1) is not voidable. The Landlord
relies upon events occurring between May 5, 2021 through to June 16, 2021.
 
3.     Subsection 68(1) of the Act
says:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
 
(a)  
a
notice of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67;
and




 
(b)  
more than seven days but less
than six months after the notice
mentioned in clause (a) was
given to the tenant, an activity
takes place, conduct occurs or
a situation arises that constitutes grounds for a notice of termination under
section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an activity, conduct or a situation
that is described in subsection 61 (1) and that involves an illegal act, trade,
business or occupation described in clause 61 (2) (a). [Emphasis added]
 
4.        
The second Form N5 relies solely
upon activities that have occurred
prior to, or during the 7-day voiding period of the first
Form N5. As such, it does not comply with the mandatory requirements of the Act
and is invalid.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s L2 application,
however, also makes a claim for damages in the amount of $3,226.00, as a result of the Tenant blocking access to the
Landlord’s contractors in order to complete the removal of the Tenant’s trailer
and the performance of certain electrical repairs.
 
6.    
Section 89 of the Act allows a landlord to apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord
has incurred or will incur
for the repair of, or
where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property,
if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the
residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the
tenant is in possession of the rental unit. To succeed in its application, the
Landlord must show that the damage is “undue”, meaning it is beyond normal wear
and tear, and considered to be excessive or unnecessary.
 
7.    
The Landlord submits she incurred
the cost of $500 for each time her contractor visited the property to remove the Tenants’
trailer, for a total cost of $3000. In addition, it is also submitted she incurred a charge of $226 for a service
call to repair certain electrical defects, for which entry was denied by the
Tenant. While it is very unfortunate
that the Landlord incurred these charges, section 89 of the Act requires the
Landlord to show a repair or replacement cost for “damage”, and further that
the damage to property must be
“undue”. That is not the case here.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
