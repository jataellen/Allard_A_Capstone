Section 68
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96975-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
1906, 20 THOMAS
RILEY ROAD ETOBICOKE ON
  M9B0C3


 




Between:


Kaushal Kapasi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rose Oria


Tenant



 
 
 
Kaushal Kapasi
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy
and evict Rose Oria
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 1 p.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The rental unit is a condominium.
 
2.    
The Tenant took
possession of the rental unit on April 10, 2021. Shortly after taking
possession, there have been several
complaints against the Tenant regarding excessive noise and smoking in the rental unit in violation of
the condominium rules.
 
3.    
As a result of the
Tenant’s and the Tenant’s guests’ behaviour, police have attended on several occasions. The Landlord also received a letter from the lawyers
representing the condominium
corporation seeking legal costs associated with the Tenant’s behaviour. These
costs have been paid by the Landlord.
 
4.    
This conduct has
substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable
enjoyment of the residential complex. This conduct also substantially
interferes with a lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlord and the other
tenants and owners.

5.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.    
The was not present
at the hearing to request relief
and the Tenant’s
behaviour has continued after
receiving multiple N5 notices from the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
January 22, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 22, 2022, then starting January
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after January 23, 2022.
