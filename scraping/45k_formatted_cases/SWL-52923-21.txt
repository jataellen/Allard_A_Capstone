5008767
Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict John Roloson and Trista Clunas (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenants permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because
they another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the
damage.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, H. Caron, attended the hearing. As if 10:22 a.m., the
Tenants were not present or represented although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant; and because they another occupant of the rental
unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord had served on the Tenants with two N5 notices. The
first N5 had a termination date was July 20, 2021 and was served on June 30, 2021. The second had a termination date of July 24, 2021 and
was served on July 9, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s legal agent
testified she is the owner of the unit. The first N5 was pertaining to the Tenants’ substantial
interference and damages. On June 24, 2021, the Landlord’s property manager
attended the Tenants’ unit and noted the Tenants erected a tent in the common area,
damaged the exterior
walls, and stored
various refuse in the common areas.
The Tenants were requested to clean up the area. An inspection of the interior
of the unit




 
was scheduled for June 28, 2021. On this date, the erected
tent was not removed, and the
Tenants refused the Landlord’s access for inspection. On June 29, 2021, the
Landlords scheduled an inspection of the interior of the Tenants’ unit on July
1, 2021, for which the Tenants refused.
 
3.    
The Landlord served a second N5
notice on the Tenants, seeking termination of the tenancy for the Tenants’
wilful or negligent
damage. The notice
repeats the events
of June 28, 2021 and July 1,
2021 wherein the Tenants denied entry into the unit for inspection. The new event took place on July 3, 2021 wherein
the Landlord attended
the unit to inspect
the unit for which the Tenants again denied access. The police were called to
the unit to provide the Landlord
access. While inside,
the Landlord noted
that damages to the interior were substantial. A. Masri from
Master Homes Renovations attended with her and estimated the damages at
$44,904.90.
 
Law and Analysis
 
4.    
The Landlord’s claim for damages in the first N5 is invalid. Subsection 62(2) of the Act sets out the required elements for a
valid N5 Notice for damages:
 
62.   (2) A notice
of termination under this section
shall,
 
(a)  provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after the notice is given;
(b)  set out the grounds for termination; and
(c)  require the tenant,
within seven days,
(i) 
to repair the damaged property or
pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of repairing the damaged property, or
(ii)
to replace the damaged
property or pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of
replacing the damaged property, if it is not reasonable to repair the damaged property.
 
 
5.    
While the Landlord included an
option to void, she did not indicate what the reasonable costs were to repair
or replace the damaged property
as required by paragraph (c) above.
As such, this portion of the Landlord’s first N5 notice is dismissed.
 
6.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
7.     Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
find that the Tenants substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable
enjoyment by failing to address the substantial amount of refuse and refusing
entry into the unit for inspections.




 
8.    
Section 68(1) of the Act states
that a Landlord may give a tenant a second notice of termination of the tenancy
if a notice of termination was given to the tenant under section 62, 64 or 67 of the Act and if more than seven days but less
than six months after the first notice was given, conduct
occurs that constitutes grounds for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67. The
conduct that occurred in the second N5 constitutes grounds for a notice of
termination under section 62 of the Act which allows the Landlord to serve a notice of termination for wilful
or negligent damage and section 64 pertaining to substantial interference. However, the conduct alleged
in the second N5 notice took place within seven days after the first notice was served. As such, the Landlord cannot
terminate the tenancy based on the second N5.
 
9.    
However, subsection 64(3) states
that the notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within seven days
after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity or corrects the
omission. The evidence at the hearing and the second N5 notice describes how
the Tenants denied the Landlord’s access for inspection on July 1, 2021 and
July 3, 2021. As such, I find that the Tenants did not void the first N5
notice.
 
DAMAGES
 
10.  The Landlord also applied for compensation for
damages. Photographs of the damages taken on September 22, 2021 were submitted
into evidence. The photographs showed garbage in the front and back of the
unit, a torn screen in the master bedroom window, stucco that had been scraped
and damaged, torn wallpaper, severely damaged carpet, damaged smoke detector
and carbon monoxide detector, substantial water damage and mold was found in the bathroom, the master bedroom
closet door was off it’s hook, the light
fixture in the master bedroom was damaged, the light switches in multiple rooms
were broken, large holes in the bedroom and kitchen wall, damaged stove, scraped baseboards, kitchen counters had dents and
chips, among other things.
 
11.  The Landlord also submitted into evidence the quote
for damages from A. Masri from Master Homes renovations dated July 6, 2021. The
email detailed the damages and provided the estimate for repair at $44,904.90.
The Landlord testified that the quote was just for repair and not for any
improvements or renovations.
 
Law and Analysis
 
12.  Subsection 89(1) says:
 
A landlord
may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord
has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not
reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant,
another occupant of the
rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex
wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the
residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
13.  The language of section 89 requires damage to be
undue. It is recognized that some damage will occur over the regular course of time, due to regular wear and tear in a




 
residential complex.
Reasonable wear and tear would not normally
constitute “undue damage” (Kamoo
v. Brampton Caledon Housing Corp. 2005 O.J. No. 3911).
 
14.  Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I
find that the Tenants caused this damage and the damage was undue. I base this
on the photographs submitted into evidence, showing substantial damage throughout the unit and on the
exterior of the unit.
 
15.  The remaining issue is whether
the Landlord’s claim
for $35,000.00 to repair or replace the damage is reasonable. I find that it is. The Landlord’s uncontested evidence from A. Masri clearly identified the damage in the
unit and the estimated cost to repair. The amount claimed was well above the Board’s
monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. I am also satisfied
that the quote was only for repairs to the unit and did not include any claims
for improvements or renovations.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
16.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord was not aware
of any of the Tenants’ circumstances for me to consider denying or
delaying eviction. The Tenants did not attend the hearing to testify to their
circumstances. As such, relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 7, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
7, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February
8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 7, 2022, then starting
February 8, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 8, 2022.
