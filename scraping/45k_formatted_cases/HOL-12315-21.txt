Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12315-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1117, 629
KING STREET WEST TORONTO ON M5V 0G9


 




Between:


Catherine Filippov


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tosh Johnson


Tenant



 
 
 
Catherine Filippov (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tosh Johnson (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 2, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Ilya Mironov attended the hearing.
The Landlord attended the hearing. As of 1:54 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2018 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October
11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,700.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.    
There is no last month’s rent deposit.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s claim for the period
ending February 28, 2022 exceeds
the Board’s monetary
jurisdiction of $35,000.00.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $35,000.00* (limited by jurisdiction of the Board), which represents the amount of rent owing
and compensation up to February
14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $55.89 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 25, 2022, then starting
February 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 26, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 25, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $48,086.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 26, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
