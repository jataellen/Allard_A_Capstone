Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11908-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


91 KIMBERLEY AVENUE TORONTO ON M2E2Z4


 




Between:


Yoel Moyal


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Solluna Cinco


Tenant



 
 
 
 
Yoel Moyal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Solluna
Cinco (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy. That application was resolved by order HOL-11908-21
issued on September 13, 2021.
 
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order HOL-11908-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021, and on February
15, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, B. Di Lisi, the Tenant,
and the Tenant’s legal
representative, L. Mayorga, attended the hearing. The Tenant was assisted with Tagalog interpretation by translator M. Abad. The Landlord’s witnesses J. Dabu and M.J. Viejo, and the Tenant’s witnesses, L. Cinco and H.
Ergun, also attended.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord alleges
that the parties
signed an N11 agreement to terminate the tenancy
on August 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant alleges that she was misled to sign the N11
agreement to terminate the tenancy under false pretences. The Tenant is a vulnerable, elderly woman,
and she alleges that former
Landlord misrepresented the nature of the document
she was signing.
 
Preliminary Issue,
the Tenant’s Rental
Unit:
 
3.    
The residential complex is a house that has been divided
into three separate units.
 
4.    
It is undisputed that the Tenant
has lived in the residential complex since 1994. The
residential complex was sold on or about
July 2021, and the Tenant signed the
N11 agreement to terminate with the former owner and Landlord, J. Dabu (JD).




 
 
 
5.    
It is unnecessary for me to determine the circumstances in which the Tenant signed the N11 agreement
to terminate, because
I find that the N11 agreement to terminate did not
properly identify the rental unit for the reasons that follow.
 
6.     It is undisputed that the Tenant
has always lived in the upper rental
unit.
 
7.     The Tenant’s witnesses had photos of at least two
separate entrances to the residential complex.
There is an outside door to enter
the main floor
rental unit, and a separate
door to enter the upper rental unit. Each door has a separate
mailbox, one with “91A” and one with “91B”. The parties allege that there is a basement rental unit, but I
did not hear evidence about whether it is rented, or who lives in that unit.
 
8.    
There were differing accounts of
how, and under what circumstances the Tenant’s daughter and her husband, L. Cinco (LC) and H. Ergun (HE), came to
reside in at least a portion of the main floor unit. The former Landlord, J. Dabu (JD), does not dispute that there
are two separate units. JD said that
he has personal belongings in the main floor unit, and that he lived there
a few years ago. However,
it was undisputed that the Tenant
never lived on the main floor.
 
9.     The N11 agreement
to terminate, submitted
with the Landlord’s L3 application, stated that
the name of the Tenant was S. Cinco, and the address of the rental unit is 91
Kimberley Ave.
 
10.  The Tenant’s rental unit cannot possibly be 91 Kimberley Ave, as it is undisputed that she has never
resided in all of 91 Kimberley Ave, and there are at least two, and possibly
three rental units at 91 Kimberley Ave.
 
11.  Subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’),
provides that any notice of termination shall identify
the rental unit for which the notice is given.
 
12.  The N11 agreement
to terminate failed to properly
identity the rental
unit for which the
notice was given.
 
13.  Subsection 77(8) of the Act provides that an order
based on an agreement to terminate
may be set aside, if (a)(i) the landlord and tenant did not enter into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy. There
can be no lawful agreement to terminate a tenancy if the agreement does not contain a properly identified rental
unit.
 
14.  The eviction order HOL-11908-21, issued on September
13, 2021, that is based on the unlawful agreement to terminate will
be set aside.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order HOL-11908-21, issued on September 13, 2021, is set aside.




 
2.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
