Amended Order
Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory
Powers Procedure Act
 
 
File Number: TSL-98384-18-AM
 










 
 

This
amended order is issued to correct a clerical error in the original order
issued on September 28, 2018, namely: to remove “N” from the address of the
rental unit covered by the application. The rest of the order remains
unchanged.
 
C.I.C
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.G
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on September 24, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from August 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 17, 2018.

2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent as of the date
of the hearing is $715.48.
4.      The
Tenant paid $175.00 after the application was filed.
5.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 18, 2018 to
August 17, 2018.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 9, 2018.
2.      As
of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation
the Landlord is entitled to by $130.91*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant: $23.52 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting September 29, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit,
and $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 9, 2018, then starting October 10,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 10,
2018.
7.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $890.96 if the payment is made on or before September 30, 2018, or
ii)       $1,606.44 if the payment is made on or before October 9, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
9.      Due to a potential
Canada Post strike, the Landlord must immediately give a copy of this Order to
the Tenant by:
•       
handing it to the Tenant;
•       
handing it to an apparently adult
person in the rental unit;
•       
placing it under the door of the
rental unit or through a mail slot in the door;
•       
leaving it in the Tenant mail
box; or, if there is no mail box, leaving it at the place where mail is
ordinarily delivered to the Tenant.
 
The Landlord shall not
use regular mail, registered mail or courier to deliver the Order.
