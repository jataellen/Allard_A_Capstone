Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99032-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


8757 PAWPAW LANE NIAGARA FALLS ON L2H3S4


 




Between:


Shilpa Arya


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeffrey Barnhart


Tenant



 
 
 
Shilpa Arya (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeffrey Barnhart (the
'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on
October 29, 2021 with respect to application HOL-10990-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1,000.00 (arrears
and cost) on or before November 15, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$8,686.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order HOL-10990-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $8,686.00 and that amount
is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order HOL-10990-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 2, 2020 to
January 6, 2022.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
HOL-10990-21 is
cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,098.13*. (less
any payments made by the Tenant after this application was filed on November 18
, 2021)This amount represents the rent owing up to January 6, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$69.04 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.

The tenant has until January 16, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
