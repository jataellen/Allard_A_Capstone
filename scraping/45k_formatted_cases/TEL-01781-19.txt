Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-01781-19
 











 
 
 

T.A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict F.M. and M.S.S. (the 'Tenants') because they
have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 22,
2019.
 
The Landlord’s agent, D.K., and
the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
By way of background, this
is a month-to-month tenancy and rent is due on the first of every month. The
tenancy began nine years ago; the Tenants live in the rental unit with their four
children ages 14, 13 and two children under 10 years old. 
2.     
The Landlord alleges the Tenants
have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Since April
2018, the Tenants have paid their rent late every month. The N8 notice of
termination was served on the Tenants May 10, 2019. Since then, the Tenants
have continued to pay their rent late for the months of June and July 2019,
although July’s rent was paid earlier than usual. 
LANDLORD’S EVIDENCE 
3.     
The Landlord’s records show
letters to the Tenant going back to May 2015 reminding the Tenants that rent is
due on the first of the month. However, the application before me is for the
period April 2018 to present and the documentation relevant to this period
shows three letters: March 13, 2019, January 3, 2019 and December 3, 2018, all
referring to outstanding arrears.
4.     
The Landlord testified that
he contacted the Tenants in February 2019 about the late payment of rent
but there was still no change in behaviour and so the Landlord resorted to
serving the Tenants an N8 notice of termination. 
5.     
The Landlord also submitted
evidence of the Tenants’ payments made for this period which is consistent with
the allegations contained in N8 notice of termination. When comparing the two
documents I find that in some months the payments were made the day the
Landlord deposits the money to the bank while in other months the payments were
made two days prior to the money being deposited to the bank by the Landlord.
Either way, the dates the Tenants actually
made payments are accurately reflected on the notice of termination – either they
are on the date or a few days earlier.  
TENANTS’ EVIDENCE
6.     
The Tenants do not
dispute the fact that their rent is not made on time. They say that they had an
agreement with the Landlord that they could pay their rent late but no documentary
evidence of this agreement was provided at the hearing. 
7.     
They testified that they pay
their rent after receiving their Child Tax Benefit (‘C.T.B.’) on the 20th
of each month in the amount of $2,500.00. The second-named Tenant has also been receiving Ontario Works benefit
(‘O.W.’) at the end of the prior month in the amount of $1,500.00 since he lost
his job.  
8.     
Furthermore, they testified
that they need receipts right away to be able to pay their rent on time. It is
only when they pay by cash that they are given a receipt; when the Tenants
make payments by cheque they are not deposited on the same day. 
9.     
The Tenants
testified that the rent for April 2019 was late because of an issue with the
cheque. They state that their minor son made out the cheque with an error and the
Landlord did not notify the Tenants until a few weeks later of this error, which
they immediately rectified. The delay in notification from the Landlord
resulted in late payment of rent that month. The Landlord takes issue with the
Tenants’ reasoning for the cheque error; this is because the writing on the
cheque in question is similar to the writing on other cheques.
10.  
The Tenants are
seeking a chance to preserve their tenancy and state that they feel they are
being targeted because the Landlord waited seven years to bring this
application. They testified that their financial circumstances have improved as
they have secured a loan of $4,000.00 which will allow them to budget their expenses
better so that their rent can be paid on time. There was no documentary
evidence provided by the Tenants to support this assertion. 
ANALYSIS
11.  
Based on the evidence before
the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenants have persistently paid their rent late for the
past 15 months, as of the date of the hearing.  This is not disputed by either
party. The Landlord has not brought the Tenants to the Board before on a persistent late
payment application prior to this one. 
12.  
With respect to the issue of
rent receipts, the Landlord has an obligation to provide receipts for rent
payments pursuant to subsection 109(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') upon the Tenants’ request. However, it is unclear to me how
a rent receipt impacts the Tenants’ ability to pay their rent every month. I
take it that this issue was raised to explain that the Tenants had no
evidence of the cheque payments aside from the date that was marked on the
cheque. 
13.  
The Landlord is seeking a
termination of this tenancy. He asserts the Tenants are
unable to pay their rent on the first of the month as they have not provided
any documents to support their improvement in financial circumstances. They
receive payments on the 20th and 27th of the month and
this has always been the case; they have not budgeted properly to ensure their
rent is paid on the first. 
14.  
In the alternative, if the Tenants
are granted a conditional order, the Landlord is requested that the payments be
ordered in guaranteed funds given the cheque issue for April 2019. 
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. Given the fact that the Tenants
have not been to the Board before for a prior N8 notice of termination followed
by an L2 application, the fact that the Tenants testified to an improvement in their financial
circumstances, I find it appropriate to exercise relief.  
16.  
As of the date of the
hearing to the date of this order, the rents for August and September 2019 have
also come due. To be fair to both parties, I find it appropriate to require that
these rents be made in full and no later than September 20, 2019, if they have
not already done so. A conditional order shall issue permitting the tenancy to
continue so long as the Tenants pay
the rent for these two months and then pay the rent on time for the next 12
months.    
17.  
I am not inclined to order
the Tenants to pay their rent in guaranteed funds based on a one-time
cheque error. The Landlord’s records show the Tenants have
made cheque payments 12 times in the past 16 months, resulting in only one
incident of a cheque not clearing. I do not find this to be sufficient grounds
to order the Tenants to make payments in guaranteed funds.
18.  
This order contains all of
the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.   
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
If they have not already
done so, the Tenants shall pay the rents for August 2019 and
September 2019 in full and no later than September 20, 2019.  
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period commencing October 1, 2019
to September 30, 2020. 
3.     
If the Tenants fail to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenants.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application on or before
September 14, 2019.
 
5.     
If the Tenants fail to
comply with paragraph 4 of this order, the Tenants will start to owe interest. 
This will be simple interest calculated from the day after the breach at 3.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
