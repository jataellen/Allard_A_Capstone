Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marshal
Pobrislo and Gabriele Wohler
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 26, 2022. As
of 9:38 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s Agent, Sharon Harris
attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s Agent informed
the Board that the Landlord sold the building,
that the Landlord was no longer seeking termination
of the tenancy, and that the Landlord was only seeking an order for the amount
owing up to October 19, 2021.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit
when the Landlord filed the application.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,525.12.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $1,800.00 after
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $677.02*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
