File Number: TEL-13863-20
 
 



In the matter

Between:


Imh Pool

Metcap Living Management Inc


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Walters


Tenant



 
 
 
Imh Pool Xvii Lp and Metcap
Living Management Inc (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard
Walters (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on June 16, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative
Joanna Aloy attended the hearing.
As of 11:56 a.m., the
Tenant failed to appear for the hearing.
 
The matter
proceeded by way on an uncontested hearing
pursuant to section
7 of Statutory Powers of
Procedure Act.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October
28, 2020.
 
2.     The Landlords collected
a rent deposit of $1,402.84
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to October 28, 2020.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $7,704.66 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Tenant is still in possession of the rental
unit.




File Number: TEL-13863-20
 
6.    
The monthly rent is $1,433.69.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before
March 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $14,239.97*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 23,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
The Landlord shall deduct any payments made by
the Tenant since this matter was heard.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $46.12 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 24,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before March
6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 6, 2022, then starting March 7, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)               
$15,135.30 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$16,538.14 if the payment
is made on or before
March 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
