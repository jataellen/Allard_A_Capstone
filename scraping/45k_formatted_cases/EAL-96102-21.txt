Tenants




 
 
Mohammed Alam (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashtine Cote and Aaron White (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. The
Landlord's Legal Representative, Denis Sabourin, and the Tenant,
Aaron White, attended
the hearing. The Tenant
spoke with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 14, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
January 10, 2022. The Tenants
were in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,000.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,000.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 1, 2020 to
December 31, 2020.
 
Section 82 issues
 
7.    
I
declined to hear the Tenant’s
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), which provides the that the:




File Number: EAL-96102-21
 
Board shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could be the subject
of an application made by the
tenant under this Act if the tenant,
 
(a)   
complies with the requirements set out in subsection (2); or
 
(b)    provides an explanation satisfactory to the Board explaining why the tenant
could not comply with the
requirements set out in subsection (2).
 
7. The Tenant did not give advanced
written notice to the landlord of the
tenant’s intention to raise the
issues at the hearing, as required by subsection 82(2) of the Act, and did not
provide a satisfactory explanation for not complying with this requirement. In
addition, the Tenant states he has filed an application with the Board to address
his issues. The Tenant
will have an opportunity to be heard on his issues when a hearing is scheduled
for his application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January
10, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $31,470.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 10, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
