Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Micheline
Lamarre (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Rebecca Osmond, attended the hearing. As of 2:11 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on January
31, 2022. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $865.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,710.00 after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of January 31, 2022, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,694.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022.




File Number: NOL-44404-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 22, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
