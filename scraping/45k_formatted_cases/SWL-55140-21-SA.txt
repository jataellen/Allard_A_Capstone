Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number:
SWL-55140-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


3660 GIRARDOT STREET WINDSOR ON N9C1W5


 




Between:


Salvatore Giancola


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Akia Jackson-King
  Wade King
Tania Jackson-King


Tenants



 
 
 
Salvatore Giancola (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Akia Jackson-King, Wade King and Tania Jackson-King (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on September 9, 2021 with respect to application SWL-51205-21.
 
The matter
was directed to hearing to clarify
who are the Tenants. On September
13, 2021 the Landlord submitted an amended L4 application adding
Tania Jackson-King as a Tenant
as her name was omitted from
the original aL4 application.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Brenell Dean, attended the hearing. As of 1:37 p.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: pay the lawful monthly rent for September on September 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.




 
 
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$9,651.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-51205-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $9,651.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-51205-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from September 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,850.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2020 to
February 17, 2022.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants did not pay the rent due
September 1, 2021 and did not vacate on October 31, 2021 as consented to at the
hearing August 30, 2021.
 
9.    
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-51205-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$7,598.14*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 17, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$60.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 18,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
