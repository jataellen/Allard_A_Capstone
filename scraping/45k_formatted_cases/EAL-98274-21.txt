Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98274-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


409, 87 COMPTON STREET KINGSTON ON K7K 5Z3


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Samantha
  MacDonald


Tenant



 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Samantha MacDonald (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
for charges related to NSF cheque fees.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Adelina Andreita
attended the hearing. As of 10:43 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,418.17
as of October 1, 2021.
 
4.    
The NSF cheque charges
were not substantiated; therefore, the charges
are disallowed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,377.55 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period ending November 30, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $2,838.90 after the application was filed.




File Number: EAL-98274-21
 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,462.67*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.62 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$4,356.71 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$5,774.88 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
