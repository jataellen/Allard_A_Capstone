Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26909-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


420
  RAGLAN ST PALMERSTON ON N0G2P0


 




Between:


Benjamin Scholten


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hervey Shenk
  Nicolas Shenk


Tenants



 
 
 
Benjamin Scholten (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Hervey Shenk and Nicolas Shenk (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 20, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 20, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 20, 2022, then starting March 21, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 21, 2022.
