Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Mark Darcy


Landlord



 
 
 
Cecile Roslin and Douglas
Soltys (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Mark Darcy (the 'Landlord') has collected or
retained money illegally (T1 Application),
 
AND
 
Cecile Roslin and Douglas
Soltys (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Mark Darcy (the 'Landlord') gave a Notice of
Termination in bad faith (T5 Application).
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2021 at 9 A.M.
 
The Tenants, the Tenant's
Legal Representative, Ms. Darcy Purdy,
and the Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This amended T1/T5 application submitted on September 22, 2020, alleges the Landlord
collected rent more than the amount allowed
by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
2.    
The Tenants moved out of the
rental unit because the Landlord gave the Tenants a notice of termination claiming
the Landlord required
possession of the rental unit. The same Schedule “A” is associated
with both the T1 and T5 applications, as well as the requested remedies.




 
Tenants’ evidence and submissions
 
 
3.    
The Tenants moved into the rental unit on January
1, 2018.
 
4.    
On October 19, 2019, the Landlord gave verbal notice to the Tenants
that he and his family were moving into the rental unit and offered one
month’s compensation to the Tenants if they would move out. The Tenants
requested the Landlord issue an N12 Notice of Termination (N12), in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
5.    
As a result, on October 25, 2019,
the Landlord gave them an N12, which indicated the Landlord was moving into the rental unit. The termination date on
the N12 was December 31,
2019. However, the Tenants found a new rental unit before December 31 and the
tenancy terminated on November 24,
2019, based on an N9 Notice to terminate a tenancy.
 
6.     The
Tenants further testified that following their
move out, they were monitoring the rental unit and discovered on Google that on
August 15, 2020, the rental unit was listed for rent.
Advertisements/listings were submitted to the Board, showing the rental unit
for rent at
$2600.00 per month.
 
7.    
The Tenants testified that they believed
the Landlord only moved in to renovate
the rental unit, and then put
it up for rent to a new Tenant, at a higher cost of $2600.00 per month. The Tenants chose to issue and N9 for early termination and moved out of the rental unit November 24,2019.
 
8.    
The Tenants submitted the rental unit was a 2-bedroom (1000sf.) unit, with
a large living room area, and rent was $1995.00
plus heating expenses. The unit they moved to in November 2019 was a smaller a 1-bedroom plus den unit (550sf.),at a rent of $2285.00, which was $290.00 more per
month.
 
9.    
The Tenants’ new rental unit is
$2285.00 per month, plus gas. The Tenants are seeking remedies in the amount
of $290.00 per month, ($3480.00 over 12 months), plus Enbridge gas billings (totalling $619.11), over a one-year
period.
 
10. 
Because he new rental unit was
smaller, the Tenants had to dispose of excess furniture, as it would not fit properly
in the new rental unit.
This included a media
unit, shelving, and full-size coffee table. The Tenants
submitted junk collection receipts for $211.00 and had to purchase new furniture
in the amount of $811.30.
 
11. 
The Tenants also testified they
incurred moving costs totalling $1297.20, and submitted receipts to the Board,
including movers, frog boxes and Lyft receipts for transportation of some items.




 
12. 
The Tenant's witness, Mr. Stephen
Jersak, a brother-in-law of the Tenants, testified that after the Tenants moved
out of the rental unit,
he was asked to answer an advertisement
for rent, related to the same rental unit in August 2020.
 
13. 
The Tenant's witness submitted an
affidavit to the Board, that he was offered a rental application on August 20, 2020 by the Landlord. Additionally, he submitted that on August 23, 2020, the Landlord offered to
reduce the rent to $2300.00.
 
14. 
The Tenant's witness referenced an
audio recording, submitted to the Board, of his visit to the rental unit where
the Landlord indicated he had asked the previous Tenants to vacate the rental unit, so
his family could live there during the home renovation. After the communication of August 23, 2020, there was no further
contact.
 
15. 
The Tenant's witness could not confirm whether the rental unit was rented,
subsequently, to someone else.
 
Landlord’s evidence and submissions
 
16. 
The Landlord did not contest any of the Tenants’ evidence
respecting when and when the Tenants moved out, and the fact that
the unit has bee re-rented. He
asserted that he genuinely intended to live in the rental unit with his family
for at least one year, but the changing circumstances with COVID-19, forced
him and his family to move back into their home after living in the rental
unit for approximately seven months.
 
17. 
The Landlord testified that he
attempted to reach an agreement with the Tenants informally, without
requiring an N12 initially on October 19, 2019. He offered the Tenants
the additional one-month compensation, because
of his home renovation timeline,
which was expected to take longer than one year.
 
18. 
Because the Tenants requested that
a formal N12 notice be initiated, the Landlord
agreed to serve the N12 and did so on October 25, 2019, with a
termination date of December 31, 2019. Compensation was paid to the
Tenants and the Landlord did issue a declaration confirming his genuine
intent to move into the rental unit for a minimum period of one year.
 
19. 
The Landlord testified that he
moved into the rental unit by January 15, 2020, following some minor
renovations to the kitchen and bathroom, and he anticipated that he would be in the rental unit
for at least one year. It was his intention to eventually move back into his renovated home, following this
extended period of renovation.
 
20. 
The Landlord also testified the
impact of COVID-19, in March 2020, put his family in a very difficult predicament while they were living
in the rental unit. His family
became very anxious, over the course
of seven months, and decided to move back into their home at the end of
July 2020, although renovations were still not completed. He asserted that his
children’s mental health was a significant factor in the decision to move back
into their home early. No medical evidence related to this assertion was
submitted to the Board, but the Landlord emphasized that it was the most
significant determining factor in his decision to return to the family home
earlier than anticipated.




 
 
 
21. 
Additionally, the Landlord
testified that he is small business owner with a downtown Toronto food court
operation and his business was closed for most of COVID-19. These circumstances
created a very difficult financial burden. As a result, he decided to place the
rental unit back on the market in mid-August 2020, to create some income for
himself and his family. Only oral testimony was provided to the
Board at the hearing regarding his loss of income.
 
22. 
Under cross examination, the Landlord testified that the lease agreement with the new tenant was signed on November 22,
2020, and the start date of the new tenancy was December 15, 2020.
 
23. 
Also, during cross examination,
the Landlord testified that he had not submitted any medical information
related to his children’s mental health, but was very clear that this was the primary reason
for his decision
to move out of the rental unit at the end of July
2020. He again asserted
 
Analysis
 
24. 
The T5 application is filed under
section 57 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Subsection 57(1) (a) of the Act establishes a four-part test. In
order to be successful in their T5 application, the Tenants must establish all of the requirements
of subsection 57(1)(a) on a balance of probabilities:
 
a)    
the Landlord gave a notice of termination under section 48 of the Act (the N12
notice);
b)    
the Tenants vacated the rental unit as
a result of the N12 notice or Board Order based on the N12 notice;
c)    
the notice was given in bad faith;
and
d)    
the person named in the N12 notice did not move into the rental unit within a reasonable time after the Tenants
vacated.
 
25. 
There is no dispute here that the
first two elements of this test are satisfied as the Tenants vacated
the rental unit because of an N12 notice of termination given to them under section 48 of the Act.
 
26. 
With respect to whether
the N12 was served in bad faith, section
57 of the Act states the
following.
 
(5) For the purposes of an
application under clause (1) (a), it is presumed, unless the contrary
is proven on a balance
of probabilities, that a landlord gave a notice
of termination under section 48 in
bad faith, if at any time during the period described
in subsection (6) he landlord,
 
(a)    
advertises the rental unit for rent;
 
(b)    
enters into a tenancy
agreement in respect
of the rental unit with someone other than the former tenant;




 
 
 
c) advertises the rental unit, or the building
that contains the rental unit, for sale;
 
(d)    
demolishes the rental unit or the building containing the rental unit;
or
 
(e)    
takes any step to convert the rental unit, or the building containing the rental unit, to
use for a purpose other than residential premises.
 
 
27. 
Based on the uncontradicted evidence before the Board, I find that the presumption of bad faith under s. 57(5) of the Act applies here because the
Landlord acknowledged advertising the unit for
rent in July 2020,
which is less than one year after
the Tenants vacated.
Therefore, the onus is on the Landlord to provide that the N12 notice of
termination was not served in bad faith.
 
28. 
I find that the Landlord has
rebutted the presumption of bad faith. I am satisfied that the Landlord served
the N12 in good faith and genuinely intended to live in the rental unit for at
least one year, while his house was being renovated, as supported by the fact
that he moved into the rental unit in January 2020 and remained there for
approximately seven months. I find that the Landlord’s decision to move out of
the rental unit after less than one year was due to a material change in
circumstances in the spring of 2020 related to COVID-19. The forced closure
of his business, loss of income, and the adverse
impact on his children are
reasonable explanations for his decision to move out of the rental unit in late
July 2020.
 
29. 
I also accept the Landlord’s
explanation that he decided to advertise the rental unit
for rent in mid-August 2020, was to provide
a source of income for himself. The closure of his business for an indefinite period,
and loss of income, must have been extremely difficult.
 
30. 
While the Landlord did not provide
any supporting documentary evidence, I found his oral
testimony to be consistent and credible. The Landlord’s explanation is
supported by the fact the rental unit was not rented until December 15, 2020,
more than a year after the Tenant’s had moved out.
 
31. 
As the Tenants did not establish
the bad faith of the Landlords in serving the N12 notice, the application must be dismissed.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Tenants’ application is
dismissed.
