Tracy Kennedy


Tenant



 
 
On February 4, 2022, David
Griffin (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Tracy Kennedy (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on January 19, 2022 with respect to
application TEL-18110-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order:
 
On or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant was to ensure
the driveway is free from items that interfere with the neighbour’s ability to park in the driveway; ensure
the deck is kept free of excess items stored on the deck; and shall
ensure that the basement is free of excess items that interfere with the
Landlord’s ability to perform routine maintenance.
 
As of February
4, 2022, the Tenant has not cleared
the items from the driveway, has not removed the items from
the rear deck and has not removed the excess items near to furnace in the
basement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-18110-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
