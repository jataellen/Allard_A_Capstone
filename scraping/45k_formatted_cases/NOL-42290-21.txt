Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-42290-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


306, 1 HUMBER COURT SUDBURY ON P3C5M1


 




Between:


Panoramic Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daryl Jorgenson


Tenant



 
 
 
Panoramic Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Jorgenson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jennifer
Ricci, the Landlord’s Agent, Lauren Brace,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,314.58.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,299.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 18, 2019 to
January 18, 2022.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $6,696.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: NOL-42290-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$6,951.74*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $43.22
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       
$9,623.16 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)       $10,937.74 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the
amount required under that
subsection on or after April 1, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
