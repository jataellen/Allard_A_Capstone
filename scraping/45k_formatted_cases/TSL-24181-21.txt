Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24181-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


505,
  890 JANE ST TORONTO ON M6N4C3


 




Between:


Monterey Park
Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nidal Abu-Awwad


Tenant



 
 
 
Monterey Park
Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nidal Abu-Awwad (the 'Tenant') because he has been persistently late in paying
his rent and because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 18, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, David Ciobotaru, attended the hearing. As of 12:20 p.m., the Tenant was not
present nor represented although properly served a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application:
 
1.    At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of
the Board to withdraw their L1 application as this matter has been resolved
with the Tenant.
 
2.    In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, I consent to the withdrawal of the application.
 
L2 Application:
 
3.    By way of background, this is a month-to-month tenancy
in which rent is due on the first of every month.
 
4.    The Landlord alleges the Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due for the period between July 2020
to August 2021. This resulted in the
Landlord serving the Tenant an N8 notice of termination on August 30, 2021.

5.   
Based on the uncontested evidence
before the Board, I am satisfied that the Tenant has persistently paid his rent
late from July 2020 to August 2021; however, I find that the monthly rent was
paid, for the majority of time, within the rental month.
 
6.    This is a long term tenancy; the Tenant has lived in
the rental unit since July 1, 2013 and although the Tenant was in
arrears for a number of months since the N8 notice of termination was served,
the Tenant paid those arrears in full on December 14, 2021. The Landlord did not provide any
evidence with respect to the January 2022 rent.
 
7.    I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. Given the fact that the this is a
long-term tenancy and the Tenant had attempted to pay the rent within the
rental month until he fell into
arrears, which were paid in full in December 2021, I find it appropriate to exercise relief.
 
8.   
A
conditional order shall
issue permitting the tenancy to continue so long as the Tenant continues to pay the rent on time
for the next 12 months.
 
9.   
This order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Tenant shall pay the Landlord
new rent on time and in full for the period commencing March 2022 through to
February 2023.
 
2.    If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in
accordance with paragraph 1 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to
the Tenant and within 30 days of the breach, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application on or before February
27, 2022.
 
4.    If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 3 of
this order, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at
2.00% annually onthe balance outstanding.
