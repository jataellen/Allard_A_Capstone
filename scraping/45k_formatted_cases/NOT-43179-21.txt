In the matter
of:


203, 334A DACEY ROAD E SAULT STE MARIE ON P6A5J7


 




Between:


Karen Gemmel


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Sar-Gin Developments
  Nadia Sartor
Ron Sartor


Landlords



 
 
 
Karen Gemmel (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Nadia Sartor,
Ron Sartor and Sar-Gin Developments (the
'Landlords') failed to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 17, 2022.
 
The Tenant and the first and second named Landlords above attended the hearing.
The Landlords were accompanied by Debra Christner.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application is about two things: the condition of the bathroom
with respect to mould
and mildew; and the flooring elsewhere throughout the unit.
 
2.     The Tenant takes the position that the repairs in the
bathroom are incomplete. The Landlord says if the bathroom
repairs are incomplete, the Landlord was not aware of that prior to the hearing and is willing
to remedy any remaining issues.
 
3.     With respect to the flooring
in the rest of the unit, the Tenant says it is more than 20 years old and needs replacing. The
Landlord says there is nothing wrong with the flooring except for one spot at
the doorway to the bedroom and the Landlord is willing to repair that.
 
4.     For the reasons that follow, the application is
granted in part and denied in part. The Landlords are to repair the tiles and
grouting in the bathroom and replace a damaged section of carpet at the threshold
of the Tenant’s bedroom. Abatement is ordered in the
amount of $397.22 and the Landlords shall reimburse the Tenant’s filing fee of
$48.00.




 
THE BATHROOM
 
5.     On June 1, 2021, the Tenant complained about mould and
mildew in the bathroom to the building manager. The Landlord inspected and discovered the ceiling fan was not working
so it was promptly replaced.
 
6.     At some point after that the Tenant called public
authorities and a municipal inspection was done. As a result of that inspection
an order was issued, and the Landlord did additional work in the Tenant’s bathroom.
An area behind
the toilet was patched, the toilet
was replaced, new tile flooring and baseboards were installed, and the walls
and ceiling were patched and painted. That work was completed on July 7, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant complains that the work is incomplete but
does not deny the Landlord’s assertion that the Tenant never complained again after the work was done on July 7, 2021.
 
8.     In particular, the tiles in the tub surround area are in need of some attention. Pictures filed into
evidence show that not all of the tiles are flush with the wall, at least one
is cracked, and the grouting is stained and between some tiles it has
disintegrated or pulled away. Although the application does not explicitly
refer to the tiles or grouting it is clear they are part of what the Tenant was complaining about in her application when she complained of mould and mildew.
 
9.     At the hearing
before me the Landlords agreed
that the tile surround was in disrepair and the tiles needed to be replaced.
 
10.  As a result, I am satisfied that the bathroom is still
in a state of disrepair and the Landlords are in breach of s. 20 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
An order shall issue requiring the Landlords to replace the tiles and
grouting in the tub surround area.
 
11.  The parties discussed
how that work was to be done because the Landlords want the unit vacant while workers are inside due
to concerns about COVID-19, and the Tenant wants to be present to see behind
the existing tiles because she suspects there is mould and mildew behind the
wall or walls. In order to accommodate both parties’ wishes in this regard,
they agreed that the work would be done in two stages – removal of the tiles
first so the Tenant could see behind them, followed by a return visit to
replace the tiles and apply grouting. The Tenant acknowledges this means she
will not be able to shower between stages.
 
12.  At the hearing the Tenant mentioned other problems
with the bathroom with respect to paint peeling and cracking, a loose shower
head, and paint being spilt on the door. None of these complaints are in the
application so no order shall issue with respect to them. That being said, as
the Landlords are now aware of those issues it would be prudent for them to
inspect again and to repair any outstanding deficiencies.
 
13.  In addition to an order
for repairs, the Tenant seeks abatement of the rent. The Landlords oppose the request for an
abatement on the basis that the repairs were done in a timely




 
manner and any additional work that needed
to be done was not brought to their attention by the Tenant.
 
14.  I disagree with the Landlords; abatement is an appropriate remedy
in this instance.
 
15.  I say this because the evidence supports the
conclusion that although the Landlords replaced the ceiling fan promptly, they
did nothing further until the municipality told them a notice of violation was going to be issued. Further, the
additional work that was done occurred more than a month after the Tenant complained. And finally, the bathroom is still
in a state of disrepair.
 
16.  Although I recognise the Tenant failed to complain
further after the work done on July 7, 2021, the pictures establish that anyone
inspecting that bathroom would have realised the tiles need replacing and grout work has to be done. The Landlords cannot rely on the
Tenant’s lack of additional complaint to escape liability for abatement given
that the obvious disrepair to the tiles and grout was known or ought to have
been known to the Landlords. The fact that the municipality closed
its file after
July 7, 2021 does not change
that.
 
17.  With respect to quantum of abatement, the amount requested
by the Tenant in her application is unreasonable in the
circumstances.
 
18.  Abatement is a contractual remedy designed to reflect
the idea that if a tenant is not getting all of the goods and services the
tenant is entitled to, the rent should be abated proportional to the difference between what is being paid for and what is being received. As the Tenant was entitled to a
bathroom in a good state of repair and did not receive one, she is entitled to
some abatement.
 
19.  Here, there are two abatement
periods: the period between June 1, 2021 and July 7,
2021; and the period after July 7, 2021.
 
20.  For the first of those
two periods, the bathroom was in considerable disrepair but was still
fully operational and usable. No evidence was led to support the assertions in
the application that the state of the bathroom caused the Tenant ill health or
was a safety hazard. Given the nature of the disrepair, the number of rooms in
the rental unit and my knowledge of similar like cases before the Board, it
seems to me that a reasonable abatement of the rent for this first period would
be 15% of the rent paid. At the time, the monthly rent was $791.75 so the
abatement is calculated as follows:
 
37 days x ($791.75
x 12 months ÷ 365 days/year) x 15% = $144.47.
 
21.  With respect to the period after July 7, 2021, the
outstanding disrepair is with respect to the state of the tiles and the grouting. As no evidence of actual or harmful mould was
led, that appears to be primarily a cosmetic issue. Given that, and the
factors discussed above, a reasonable abatement for this period would be about
5% of the rent charged to the date of the hearing.
As the rent increased January
1, 2022 to $801.25, the abatement
is calculated as:




 
•        
For 2021: 177 days x ($791.75
x 12 months ÷ 365 days/year) x 5% = $230.37; plus
 
•        
For 2022 up to the date of hearing:
17 days x ($801.25 x 12 months
÷ 365 days/year) x 5% =
$22.39
 
•        
For a total of $252.75.
 
22.  The total abatement the Tenant is entitled to for the bathroom for the period June 1, 2021
to January 17, 2022 is $397.22.
 
23.  The Tenant is also entitled
to an ongoing abatement of the rent of 5% until the repairs to the bathroom are completed.
 
THE FLOORING IN THE REST OF THE UNIT
 
24.  With respect to the flooring in the kitchen, the
Tenant says it was scuffed when she moved in, but no further
evidence was led about it. With respect
to the carpeting she says it is past its useful life and should
be replaced.
 
25.  The Landlords were prepared to replace the carpet but only if the Tenant
contributed
$500.00 towards its cost. As the Tenant refused,
the carpet was never replaced.
 
26.  The Landlords say the flooring
is dirty but not in a state
of disrepair except
for the section in the doorway of the Tenant’s
bedroom. That section of carpet was damaged by the Tenant’s cat and is
basically scraped down to the fibers beneath. The Tenant does not deny the
damage was caused by her pet.
 
27.  I have carefully
examined the photographs the Tenant entered
into evidence. They show
the damaged threshold the parties agree exists, but otherwise they are not
particularly helpful. Whatever areas of slight change in colour that can be
seen on the photographs may be dirt as the Landlords claim, or disrepair as the
Tenant claims. It is impossible to tell.
 
28.  On any application before the Board the applicant
bears the burden of proof. As the photographs do not support either parties’
position over that of the other, that means the Tenant has failed to establish the flooring is in a state of disrepair except for the threshold
section leading into the bedroom.
 
29.  As a result,
an order shall
issue requiring the Landlords to repair the damaged carpet at
the threshold of the Tenant’s bedroom.
The Landlords will not be ordered to replace the entirety of the flooring.
 
30.  With respect to abatement of the rent, none shall be
ordered. As the evidence supports the proposition that the damaged
area is very small and was caused
by the Tenant’s cat, no
abatement can be justified.




 
31.  Given the Tenant has been partially successful in her
application, she is also entitled to an order requiring
the Landlords to compensate her for the cost of filing the application of
$48.00.
 
32.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant
a rent abatement of $397.22.
 
2.     The Landlords shall also pay the Tenant $48.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.      
The total amount the Landlords owe the Tenant is $445.22.
 
4.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant
the full amount
owing by February
14, 2022.
 
5.     If the Landlords do not pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by February 14, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 15, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
6.     If the Landlords do not pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by February
28, 2022, the Tenant may recover this amount by
deducting it form the due March 1, 2022 or after.
 
7.     The Tenant has the right, at
any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
 
8.     On or before
February 28, 2022 the Landlords
shall:
 
(1)  
Replace the tiles and grouting in the tub surround area in the bathroom so the tiles are uniform, intact and flush, and
the grouting is intact and free of mildew or blemish; and
 
(2)  
Repair or replace the carpet in the area of the threshold of the Tenant’s
bedroom so the area is smooth,
flat and contiguous with the surrounding carpet and of the same colour and texture.
 
9.     The Tenant is entitled to deduct 5% of the rent charged
for each day after January
17, 2022 that the work described above in subparagraph 8(1) remains
outstanding.
 
10.  If the Landlords do not complete the work described in
subparagraph 8(2) above on or before February 28, 2022 then the Tenant
is entitled to file a new application with respect to the
state of the carpet for the period starting January 18, 2022.
