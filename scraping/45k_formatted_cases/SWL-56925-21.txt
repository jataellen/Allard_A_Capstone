Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56925-21
 
 



In the matter of:


BACK, 436 QUEEN
STREET S KITCHENER ON
  N2G1W7


 




Between:


Son Pham


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael Lonergan


Tenant



 
 
 
Son Pham (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael Lonergan (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17,
2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s daughter and interpreter, Ailinh
Bui, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is
based a notice of termination served pursuant to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). For the following reasons, I find that the notice of termination is invalid and
the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
2.    
Although the notice of termination alleges
that the Tenant
breached the Act by repeatedly failing to turn on the heat,
repeatedly smoking marijuana and then blocking the exit of another rental unit,
the notice only contains one date and no other times or any further specifics
regarding exactly what when these allegations occurred.
 
3.    
The leading case that must guide
my decision in this instance is Ball v. Metro Capital Property,
[2002] O.J. No. 5931. This case stands for the proposition that the kinds of
particulars that should be contained in a notice which is about a tenant’s
behaviour should include “dates and
times of the alleged offensive conduct together with a detailed description of the alleged
conduct engaged in by the tenant”. The notice here clearly does not meet this requirement.




File Number: SWL-56925-21
 
4.    
As the notice does not meet the mandatory
requirements of the Act, it is invalid
and its contents cannot be
considered. As the notice of termination is invalid, the Landlord’s application
must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
