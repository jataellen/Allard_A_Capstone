Landlord



 
 
 
Alev Demirbilek (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Marek Machtinger (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 21, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s T1
Application was signed on December 3, 2019 and filed with the Board on January 16, 2020.
 
2.    
This application was brought pursuant
to Section 135(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”) which provides a tenant may apply to the Board for
an order that the landlord pay to the tenant any money collected or retained in contravention of this Act. In this
Application, the Tenant seeks the return of a security
deposit in the amount of
$1980.00.
 
3.     The Tenant’s Application must fail, as the
Application was not filed within one year that the security deposit was
collected in contravention of the Act.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1980.00. The Tenant moved into the rental unit on
November 15, 2018 and at the request of the Landlord, paid the Landlord the
prorated rent from November 15, 2018 through to November 30, 2018, as well as a
first and last month’s rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant
also paid the Landlord
a security deposit
of $1980.00 on November 15, 2018,
in contravention of section 105 of the Act, which prohibits the collection of
any security deposit unless it is a rent deposit. In the alternative, the
deposit collected by the Landlord




File Number: TNT-23506-20
 
on November
15, 2018 exceeded
the legal rent deposit a landlord may collect under section 106(2) of the Act, as it was
collected in addition to first and last month’s rent.
 
6.     The Tenant first requested the return of
the security deposit in early November 2019, upon giving the Landlord notice
that she would be vacating the rental property. The Landlord testified the Tenant told him she would be vacating
the rental unit at the end of the month, and that he communicated to the Tenant
that he would return the security deposit if he could locate a new tenant for
the rental unit for December 1, 2019. The
Tenant ultimately vacated the premises on December 15, 2019 and the deposit was never returned.
 
7.     Section 135(4) of the Act is the applicable section
and states:
 
No order shall be made under this section with respect
to an application filed more
than one year after the
person collected or retained money in contravention of this Act
[emphasis added]
 
8.    
While the security
deposit is still retained by the Landlord, section 135(4) of the Act provides
that the Application must be filed within 1 year of the money being collected or
retained. Since the security
deposit was collected by the
Landlord in contravention of the Act on November 15, 2018, the Tenant was
required to bring her application within one year from that date. This was not done and thus, the Tenant’s
application is statute- barred.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Tenant’s
application is dismissed.
