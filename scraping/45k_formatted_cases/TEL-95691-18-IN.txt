Landlord’s L1 application.
J.E. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.L.E. P. (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
J.E. (the 'Landlord') also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.L.E.P. (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to
the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant
to compensate the Landlord for the damage. 
 
These applications were heard
in Belleville on November 23, 2018.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s representative D.S., the
Tenant and the Tenants representative N.C. attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary:
 
1.     
Upon a closer examination of what was presented
at the hearing I should have allowed the Landlord to present the damages done
to the rental unit and then in light of the nature of the damages decided if
the cost of $2,000.00 was in fact a reasonable amount.
 
2.     
As a result I have decided to bring back the L2
portion of the application at a date to be set by this Board to deal with the
damages.
 
3.     
The L1 portion of the application since the
amount is so high will proceed as an Interim order.
4.     
The Landlord may provide cost estimates at the
next Board hearing with respect to the damages. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the Landlord’s L1 application, the Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from July 1, 2017 to November 30, 2018.  Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 9,
2018.
2.     
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until December 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.
3.     
With respect to the Landlord’s L2 application,
this will be dealt with at a future meeting.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before December 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$17,528.83*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
November 27, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $55.89
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 28, 2018 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before December 31, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from January 1, 2019 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before December
31, 2018, then starting January 1, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after January 1, 2019.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and
continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in
trust:
i)        $17,900.51 if the payment is made on or before November 30, 2018, or
ii)       $19,600.51 if the payment is made on or before December 31, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 1, 2019 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
