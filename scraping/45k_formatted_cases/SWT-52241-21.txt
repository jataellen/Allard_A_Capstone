Between:

Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Azhar Nizam


Landlord



 
 
 
Fowad Abdul (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Azhar Nizam (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on January 17, 2022.
 
The Tenant’s brother and representative, Faisal Raja (“FR”)
and the Landlord
(“AN”) attended the hearing. FR provided evidence on
behalf of the Tenant and the Landlord testified on his own behalf.
 
Tenant’s Evidence
 
1.     
FR provided evidence
that he was directly involved
in the transaction in question, as he was acting as a
guarantor to assist his brother, Fowad Abdul, the named tenant in this
application, his two sisters, and his parents in finding new living
accommodations for April 1st, 2021.
 
2.     
The unit in question
is in a condominium complex.
 
3.     
FR testified that he had found the
unit online and had filled out a rental application on February 27th,
2021. That same day he attended at the unit and met with AN to provide him the application. The application had also requested references which were provided. The Landlord was further
provided copies of every tenant’s identification, a of copy ODSP statements for
proof of income, and credit reports. A copy rental application and supporting
documentation was entered into evidence to support the Tenant’s claim.
 
4.     
FR testified that on February
28th, 2021 he attended at the unit again with his brother
and father to view the unit.
 
5.     
AN had visited FR at his home
later that day to pick up 2 post-dated cheques in the amounts of $1750.00 each, both dated for April
1st, 2021 as the tenants
had wanted to




 
move in that date.
AN had had also requested property tax statements from FR to support his guarantee for the unit.
 
6.     
Not satisfied with the dates of the post-dated cheques and not wanting to lose rent for
March, AN had requested from FR an e-transfer in the amount of $3500.00
be sent to him.
 
7.     
FR further testified that AN had requested him to indicate
in the e-transfer message that the
amount being paid was non-refundable. Feeling pressured to secure a residence for his family for April 1st,
2021, FN agreed to the request and submitted a series of e- transfers in the
amount of $3500.00, sent by both himself and the Tenant.
 
8.     
FR felt at this point that it was safe for his family
to provide notice to leave their old units
to prepare to move into the unit for April1st, 2021.
 
9.     
The next day,
March 1st FR received an e-mail from AN, which was also entered as
an exhibit, requesting a new copy of the guarantor
form for his wife to sign as his wife is the owner of the property involved in the
guarantee in question, a copy of his wife’s
identification, a new copy of FR’s identification because
his driver’s license
was expired, photo
identification of his mother, both sisters, photo identification of his father
that included his name, and letters of recommendation from former landlords for
his brother the named Tenant which had to be a reference other than a student
reference, and finally a reference letter for his mother.
 
10.   This further request troubled FR, prompting to respond
shortly thereafter that references
had already been provided which
he can call along with credit profiles.
He had signed up as a
guarantor and provided tax documents to show same. He is his wife’s Power of
Attorney and had agreed to provide that documentation along with his passport
but had asked AN that if he was still not satisfied to refund the money that
was paid as his demands were becoming
unreasonable. I note that the rental application dated February 27th,
2021 and signed by the named Tenant simply asks for reference contact
information. There is no request for reference letters.
 
11.   FR had requested that AN confirm in writing that they
are receiving the unit. A copy of this request made by text message was filed
as an exhibit by AN. AN responded by e- mail that same day that the tenancy is
confirmed and that he will provide the tenants keys on March 25th,
2021 and that the tenancy will begin April 1st, 2021. I note the
language of AN in this e-mail states
that the tenancy
is to begin in April however, he had
requested and accepted a payment for rent for March 1st, 2021 so as
to ensure that he would not miss rent for that month.
 
12.   The named Tenant in the application responded
by e-mail detailing the parameters of the
agreement, agreeing that no other personal information or references need to be
provided.
 
13.  
The Landlord
responded advising the Tenant that he is preparing a copy of the Standard Lease and sent a link to same
within the e-mail. The Landlord then requested that the




 
tenants obtain Tenants Insurance
in the amount of $1,000,000.00. This request upset FR, as that request was not
detailed within the other e-mails that dictated the potential terms of the lease. I note within the Standard Lease link that was sent to the tenants that Tenants Insurance is optional.
 
14.  
It was at this point that FR felt that he could not trust AN. As well, FR felt that he could
not risk his family giving notice at their old units as he felt that at this
point in the negotiations that the tenancy was not secure.
 
15.   That same day, the
named Tenant in the application
advised AN that his family is unable to obtain Tenants Insurance in that amount and that he
is rescinding his application for the unit and that he was requesting the return of the $3500.00 that was to secure the unit
for rent for March and last month’s rent. AN refused to pay anything back, as
he noted that the deposit was not refundable.
 
16.  
FR on behalf of
his brother the named Tenant
is seeking the Board to order
that AN repay the deposit
paid in the amount of $3500.00, as well as the filing
fee of $53.00.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
17.   On the outset of his evidence, AN pointed out to the
parties that there was never a tenancy agreement signed and as such the parties did not enter into a rental agreement. I will address this submission
later.
 
18.   The testified that he was approached by FR who was
very eager to secure the unit, as he was about to leave for Pakistan but that he wanted to secure the unit for
his family as soon as
possible.
 
19.   He testified that when the family viewed
the unit on February
28th that he had answered all their concerns and that the
tenants had offered him to pay a deposit to secure the unit.
 
20.   With respect to the issue of the language of the
deposit being non-refundable, AN testified that he never forced
FR to write in the e-transfer message that the deposit was non-refundable. This direct testimony contradicts some of the materials that AN filed as evidence that were accepted as
exhibits at the outset of the hearing where AN emphasises the fact that the
deposit paid was non-refundable.
 
21.  
AN agreed that he was requested to assure FR that the unit would be given to his family and would not be cancelled.
 
22.  
He testified that he had two other parties
interested in the unit
but that he decided not to
rent out the unit after the tenancy was cancelled by FR as he was of the opinion that the unit was in possession of the
tenants as they had paid rent for March 2021.
 
23.  
He further testified on this point that he did not rent the unit for either April or May, as he was hoping that the tenants would change their mind
and accept occupancy, going so far




 
as to call FR to offer
to remove any additional restrictions. This offer was never accepted
and the tenants never moved into the unit.
 
24.  
AN stated
further that he had offered
to repay FR $1750.00 in return for last month’s
rent deposit but that he had refused because FR felt he was owed the
entire deposit back.
 
Analysis – Was there a tenancy
agreement?
 
25.   AN claims that there was no agreement however, a copy
of the rental application completed by
the named Tenant in this application
was filed as an exhibit. Section
13(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”) states that a tenancy agreement takes effect when the tenant is entitled to occupy the rental
unit, whether or not the tenant actually occupies it. The tenants were
scheduled to take possession of the
rental unit by April 1st, 2021 however, the parties all
agreed that the rental deposit paid would be applied to March 2021, as AN did
not want to lose rent for that month.
 
26.   I find based
on the evidence before me that the unit was vacant, and the tenants
could have obtained possession of the unit in advance of April 1st,
2021 had they requested same from AN.
 
27.   A rental application was completed and despite no
formal lease being created and signed, I find that despite
the tenants cancelling their application on March 1st, 2021 this does not
undermine the fact that tenants had paid a deposit to secure the unit for that
same date. Accordingly, I find that the tenancy agreement began March 1st,
2021.
 
Rent Obligations
 
28.   On March 1st, 2021, the parties assumed
their respective rights and responsibilities
under the tenancy agreement and the Act. On that day, the Tenants became
liable for the rent until the tenancy was terminated or the rental unit was re-rented to other tenants.
 
29.   Subsection 37(1) of the Act states that a tenancy
may be terminated only in accordance
with the Act. In order for a tenant to terminate a tenancy under the Act he or
she must provide proper notice. The Tenants did not provide the Landlord with a
notice to terminate the tenancy in accordance with the Act.
 
30.   Section 88 of the Act states that where a tenant
abandons a tenancy without giving proper notice, the tenant is liable for the
rent for the period
of notice he or
she could have given to the landlord to properly terminate the tenancy.
In this case that would be 60 days and the Tenants
are potentially liable for rent for the period of March
1st, 2021 up to
and including April 29th, 2021.
 
31.  
The term potentially is used in this case as I must also consider
whether AN successfully mitigated his losses.
Section 16 of the Act states: “Where
a landlord or a tenant
becomes liable to pay any amount as a result of a breach of a tenancy
agreement, the person
entitled to claim the amount has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize
the person’s losses.”




 
 
 
32.  
Therefore, AN had
the obligation once the Tenants told the Landlord that they were breaching the tenancy agreement and would not be moving
in, to try and find another
tenant for the unit as quickly as possible.
 
33.  
AN testified that despite having
interest in the unit from other parties, he made the choice
to not rent the unit until June 1st, 2021. He did so because he was
hoping that the Tenants would change their minds.
 
34.  
While certainly
commendable by AN to want to try to resolve
the issue with the tenants,
I find on the evidence provided that the Landlord did not mitigate his
losses in these circumstances. I find it difficult
to believe that AN would wait 3 months for the tenants to change their minds
when I have no evidence of any communication with them beyond March 1st,
2021 before me.
 
Findings
 
35.  
The evidence was made clear to me that despite the tenants wanting to take possession of the
unit on April 1st, 2021,
the deposit paid by the tenants on February 28th, 2021 was for the month of March
so that AN would not miss rent for that month. FR testified that he
was set to pay $1750.00 in rent again for April 2021. As such, I find that the
tenancy began on March 1st, 2021.
 
36.  
I find further
that despite FR’s issues with AN’s demands that FR, on behalf of the tenants did not terminate the tenancy in accordance with the Act and as such, the rent
paid for March of 2021 is not owing to the Tenant.
 
37.  
That said, I find further that AN did not rent the unit until June 1st, 2021, failing to mitigate
his losses as required under s. 16 of the Act and as such, the last month’s
rent deposit that would have been applied for rent for April 1st,
2021 is due and owing to the Tenant.
It is ordered that:
 
38.  
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant the sum of $1,750.00. This amount represents
$1,750.00 for the last month's rent
deposit.
 
39.   The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
40.   
The total amount the Landlord owes to the Tenant is $1,803.00.
 
41.   If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant the full
amount owing by March 7th, 2022, the Landlord
will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7th, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.




 
42.  
The Tenant has the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
