Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20690-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 36 KENCLIFF CRESCENT SCARBOROUGH ON M1P4E5


 




Between:


Rekha Queenlin Nevilin Viju Nevilin Viju Abrakam


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Anna Maria Gulyas Gerco Szendrei


Tenants



 
 
 
Rekha Queenlin Nevilin Viju and
Nevilin Viju Abrakam (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anna Maria Gulyas
and Gerco Szendrei
(the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant. The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by video/teleconference on February 8, 2022.
 
Only the Landlords and their legal representative, Jathusan
Ratnakumaran, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords served the Tenants a
Notice of Termination, Form N5, because the Tenants repeatedly played loud music between
12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m., and because the Tenants failed to sort garbage
as required by the municipality.
 
2.     The Tenants did not void the Notice
of Termination.
 
3.     Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I am
satisfied that the Tenants substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 27, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February 27, 2022,
they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 27, 2022, then starting February
28, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 28, 2022.
