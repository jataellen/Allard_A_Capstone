In the matter of:      BASEMENT, 369 ELLIOTT
STREET

Bill Griffin Jennifer Murrin


Tenants




 
 
Surrinder Soomal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer Murrin and Bill Griffin (the
'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November
29, 2021. The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative,
Allison Skinner, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords application is based on a first N5 notice
of termination.
 
2.    
The N5 notice of termination is defective because
it does not require the Tenants
to stop the conduct or
activity within 7 days of receiving it, as required by subsection 64(2)(c) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
3.     Therefore, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
