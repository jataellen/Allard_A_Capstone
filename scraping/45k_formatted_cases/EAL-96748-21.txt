Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: EAL-96748-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
C, 605 MCGEE STREET PEMBROKE ON K8A6E8


 




Between:


Kalathil (Ken)
  Philipose


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jason Acorn


Tenant



 
 
 
Kalathil (Ken) Philipose (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Acron Acorn (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Lori Nolan attended the hearing. As of 9:45 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
Duty counsel, Kathleen Price,
attended the hearing to request an adjournment on behalf of the Tenant because
the Tenant is currently incarcerated. The Tenant’s request is denied for the
following reasons. The matter was previously before the Board October 5, 2021.
At that hearing, the Board granted the Tenant’s request for an adjournment. The adjournment was made peremptory on the Tenant.
The Tenant has not been paying
the lawful monthly rent and the arrears continue to accrue. A further delay
would be prejudicial to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 27, 2021.
 
3.     
The application is amended
to reflect the Tenants name as Jason Acorn.
 
4.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
5.     
The lawful monthly rent is $775.00.
 
6.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $775.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: EAL-96748-21
 
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 31, 2020 to July 27, 2021.
 
8.     
The Tenant paid $500.00
after the application was filed.
 
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,075.03*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $25.48 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$5,111.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$5,886.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: EAL-96748-21
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
