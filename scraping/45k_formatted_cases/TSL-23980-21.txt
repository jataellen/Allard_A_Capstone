File Number: TSL-23980-21
 
 
In the matter of:      103, 2531 LAKE SHORE BOULEVARD WEST TORONTO ON M8V1E7
 
Between:                  Capreit Limited Partnership                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Elisha Lamothe                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
On August 27, 2021, Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Elisha Lamothe (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on June 23, 2021 with respect to application TSL-18058-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$1,335.00 on or before July 15, 2021 and
August 15, 2021 towards arrears of rent.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$14,829.45 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-18058-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $14,829.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TSL-18058-20 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,335.55 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January
1, 2021 to January 4, 2022.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order TSL-18058-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $13,492.10*. This amount represents the rent owing up to August 31, 2021 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$43.91 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting September 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
