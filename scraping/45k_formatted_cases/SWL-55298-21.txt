Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


B, 24 MILFOIL
CRESCENT KITCHENER ON N2E3L2


 




Between:


Daniel Rangaswamy Satishwar Rangaswamy


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Constance Starr


Tenant



 
 
 
Daniel Rangaswamy and Satishwar Rangaswamy (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Constance Starr (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant,
another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlords has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for the damage.
The Landlords also applied because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords in a residential complex that has three
or fewer residential units; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 24, 2022. The Landlord, S.
Rangaswamy (SR), the Landlord’s legal representative, D. McInnis, and the Landlord’s witness, V. Judor
(VJ), attended the hearing. As of 11:25 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords served on the Tenant an N7 Notice
of Termination on September 28, 2021.
The Landlords submitted that the tenancy was terminated by way of Order SWL-51776-21 issued on September 23, 2021.
Since the tenancy is terminated, the issue of eviction is moot. As such, the
only live issue in this application is damages pursuant to section 89 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
2.     On a balance of probabilities,
I find the Tenant, an occupant of the rental
unit, or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental unit or residential complex.




File Number: SWL-55298-21
 
3.    
I am satisfied that the Tenant,
occupant or guest wilfully or negligently caused damage to the rental unit
based on SR’s uncontested evidence. SR testified that when the Tenant returned
vacant possession to the Landlord, he observed the state of the unit. There was
considerable damages: smashed toilet, large holes in the wall, hammer taken to
walls, graffiti on the walls, damages
to the mirror, bathroom tiling
smashed in several
areas, burn marks on the
cupboards, the fridge was dirty, the oven and stove were completely blackened
and the microwave ventilation was damaged and non-functional. I also
find the described damage is undue as the damage is such that it could not be a
result of reasonable wear and tear.
 
4.     VJ testified that he is a general contractor for the unit. He also attended the unit when
the Tenant returned vacant
possession to the Landlord. He observed the substantial damage. He testified that the cost of clean up, removal and repairs would be approximately
$33,000.00. He
testified that this amount is only to repair the unit from the damage and does not include any amount for improvements. The Landlord’s application sought
$10,000.00.
Based on VJ’s uncontested testimony, I am satisfied that this amount is
reasonable in these circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $10,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
