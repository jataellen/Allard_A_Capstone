Inc. C/o Haley Property Management (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dora Amaral (the

The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the

rental unit. The Landlord has received complaints everyday since September
18, 2021, that an odour of tobacco has been emanating from the Tenant’s
rental unit, mixed with
perfume in an apparent attempt to mask the odour.
 
3.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.

Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from August 3, 2020 to
January 10, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-21189-21 is cancelled.

any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
