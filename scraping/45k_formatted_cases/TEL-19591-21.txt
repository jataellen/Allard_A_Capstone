Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19591-21



In the matter
of:


ROOM -1, 526
ROMAINE STREET PETERBOROUGH
  ON K9J2E1


 




Between:


Rose Church
  Peter Church


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Don Goldsmith


Tenant



 
 
Rose Church and Peter Church (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Don Goldsmith
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord, Peter Church, attended
the hearing. As of
11:25 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
September 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is $480.70.
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
5.    
The Tenant paid $1,475.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,576.70*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $15.80
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)               
$1,831.70 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,312.40 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
