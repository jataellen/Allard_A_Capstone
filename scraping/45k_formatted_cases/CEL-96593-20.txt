UNIT #3 (REAR), 1639 COPSEHOLM TRAIL MISSISSAUGA ON L4W2C1


 




Between:


Pawel Skubik


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anna Kalikci
  Marcin Adler


Tenants



 
 
 
Pawel Skubik (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anna Kalikci
and Marcin Adler (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video hearing
on August 10, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
his legal representative Amanda Richards Tenant
Marcin Adler and his legal representative Greg Tuffman
attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues
Who is the Landlord?
 
1.     
The Tenants
still reside in the
rental unit as of the day of the hearing.
 
2.     
The residential complex
and rental unit were owned by the named Landlord when this application was
filed on October 20, 2020. However,
effective March 31, 2021, the Landlord sold the property to Tatjana Zaharova
(‘TZ’), who was not named as a party in this proceeding, did not receive a
notice of hearing and did not attend the hearing.
 
3.     
At the beginning of the
hearing, the Tenant's Legal Representative raised the issue of whether the
named Landlord has standing to proceed with this application if light of section
18 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). That
section states that covenants or agreements related to the rental unit/residential complex run with the land. The Tenant asserted that this
section means that only the current Landlord, TZ, may proceed with this rent
arrears application against the Tenant.
 
4.     
The Landlord's Legal
Representative submitted that caselaw does demonstrate that covenants run with
the land, but the rent arrears related to the application in question were not transferred to TZ in the agreement of purchase and sale. The Landlord asserts that as this application was filed by the Landlord
on October 20, 2020 before the property




File Number: CEL-96593-20
 
was sold,
the application concerns
rent arrears that became owing when the named
Landlord owned the property.
 
5.     
The Landlord's Legal Representative also provided an affidavit signed by the new
Landlord, confirming that TZ did not assume the rent arrears owing to the
former Landlord at the date of sale.
 
6.     
After considering the
submissions of the parties, based on a balance of probabilities, I find that
the (former) Landlord is not able to pursue his claim for arrears as he is no
longer the Landlord and is no longer a party to the tenancy agreement with the Tenant.
 
7.     
In Doberstein v
Doberstein, 2019 CanLII 93995 (ON SCSM), the Small Claims Court considered a very similar
fact situation and concluded that the former landlord lost his
right to claim arrears once the property was sold.
 
The law is
clear that not all residential tenancies fall under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 as some residential tenancies are
exempt. It does not change the fact that they are residential tenancies. There is nothing in the law that this court
is aware of that would change the fact that the debt of rent arrears is part of
a covenant within the privity of estate that cannot be retained by a vendor.
 
8.     
While Doberstein v
Doberstein is not binding upon me, I am persuaded by the its reasoning and similarly find that the arrears owing by the Tenant are a covenant
that were assumed by TZ upon the sale of the rental unit.
 
9.     
Since the Landlord failed to address
this debt in the agreement
of purchase and sale with TZ, this debt now belongs to TZ, who
has assumed the position of the old Landlord on March 31, 2021.
 
10.  
Therefore, the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
