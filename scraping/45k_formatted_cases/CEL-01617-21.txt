  HARTFORD TRAIL BRAMPTON ON L6W4N1


 




Between:


Goode Maurice


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nadine Williams


Tenant



 
 
 
Goode Maurice (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nadine Williams (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not vacate the rental unit by
the termination date set out in the N11 notice.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and Tenant signed
an N11 notice on March
15, 2021 and agreed to terminate the tenancy on June 15,
2021.
 
2.     In this application, the Landlord claims the Tenant did not vacate the rental
unit by the termination date; June 15, 2021.
 
3.     However, the Landlord filed this application on July
19, 2021. The application was filed more than 30 days after the termination
date set out in the N11 notice. Therefore, the Landlord’s application is out of time pursuant
to s. 77(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”).
 
4.     The Board has no jurisdiction to consider this application
which was filed beyond 30 days
after the termination date set out within the N11 notice.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
