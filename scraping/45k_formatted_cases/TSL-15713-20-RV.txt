Review Order
 
KH Residence Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Syed Zafar
(the 'Tenant') to pay
the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-15713-20 issued on October
15, 2021. On November 2, 2021,
the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 31, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative L. Nadon and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant testified on his own behalf. Joanne Gluck (JG) testified
for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.    
The Tenant’s request for a review
is based on the ground
of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the review request
took place on October 6, 2021. The Tenant did not attend.
 
3.     At the review hearing the Tenant testified
that he learned
about the hearing
on October 6, 2021 while he was on his way out of the
country. The Landlord’s representative had sent the Tenant an email on October
4, 2021 about the hearing and the Tenant testified that he read it two days
later. The Tenant testified that he did not receive any notice of the hearing
other than this email.




 
4.    
The Board’s records show that the notice of hearing for the hearing
held on October
6, 2021 was sent to the Tenant by regular mail and by email.
 
5.     In King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments Ltd., 2008 CanLII 60708,
the Divisional Court held that “being reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding must be interpreted broadly, natural justice
requires no less.”
 
6.    
Interpreting this situation
broadly, I find that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. There was no evidence
at the hearing that contradicted that he did not receive the
notice in the mail or that the email had reached him.
 
7.     Based on the above, at the hearing
I granted the Tenant’s request
for a review. The
Landlord’s L9 application proceeded de novo.
 
L9 application
 
8.     The lease for this tenancy
was on a fixed term that ended on August
20, 2020.
 
9.    
The Tenant testified that he vacated
the unit on May 1, 2020 and that he left the key to the
unit with a security guard. He
testified that he gave oral notice of termination to the
Landlord “probably in February or March 2020” that he would leave in May.
 
10.  JG is the Landlord’s general
manager of the property. At the hearing
JG testified that she
is responsible for all notices for
the tenancies in the building. JG testified that in an email on March 12, 2020
the Tenant stated that he wanted to move and that JG responded by telling him
what his options are, including that he could sublet the unit or assign it. JG
testified that the Tenant did not respond to this email. JG testified that they
did not received the keys back from the Tenant and that the Landlord’s staff
entered the unit on August 21, 2020.
 
11.  Under cross-examination JG acknowledged that in February
the Tenant had complained
about an incident with his roommate and the Landlord responded to this by
transferring the roommate to another unit.
 
12.  The Tenant testified
that he did not respond
to JG’s email about his options because
he did not think he had anything left to say to her.
 
13.  Based on the evidence of both parties, I find, on a
balance of probabilities, that the Landlord was not aware that the Tenant had
vacated the unit prior to August 21, 2020. The Tenant did not give
any notice at all that he was moving on May
1, 2020 and giving his keys to a security
guard was not sufficient to inform
the Landlord that he had left. JG had
told the Tenant
what steps he needed to take to leave the lease early but instead
of responding the Tenant just left.
 
14.  Subsection 88(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
provides as follows:




 
88 (1) If a tenant abandons or
vacates a rental unit without giving notice of termination in accordance with
this Act and no agreement to terminate has been made or the landlord
has not given
notice to terminate the tenancy, a determination
of the amount of arrears of rent owing by the tenant shall be made in
accordance with the following rules:
 
1.   
If the tenant vacated
the rental unit after giving
notice that was not in accordance
with this Act, arrears of rent are owing for the period that ends on the
earliest termination date that could have been specified in the notice, had the
notice been given in accordance with section 47, 96 or 145, as the case may be.
 
2.   
If the tenant abandoned or vacated
the rental unit without giving any notice, arrears of rent are owing for the period
that ends on the earliest
termination date that could
have been specified in a notice of termination had the tenant, on the date that
the landlord knew or ought to have known that the tenant had abandoned or
vacated the rental unit, given notice of termination in accordance with section
47, 96 or 145, as the case may be.
 
15.  In this case, paragraph 2 applies because the Tenant
did not give notice of termination. The date that could have been specified
in a notice of termination had the Tenant,
on the date that the Landlord
knew or ought to have known that the Tenant had abandoned or vacated the rental
unit, given notice of termination was October 31, 2020. The Landlord only found
out that the Tenant had vacated on August 21, 2020. If the Tenant had given
proper notice on that date it would have been at least 60 days’ notice and on a
date that is the end of a rental period.
 
16.  The Landlord is claiming rent to August
20, 2020.
 
17.  In a situation where a tenant
vacates without properly
terminating the tenancy,
a landlord is required to
mitigate their losses by re-renting the unit as soon as possible. It was not
possible for the Landlord to mitigate its losses earlier than August 20, 2020
as the Landlord was not aware by that date that the unit was available to
re-rent.
 
18.  For the reasons
above, I find that the Tenant is responsible for rent to August 20, 2020.
 
19.  It is uncontested that the last month for which the Tenant paid rent was January 2020.
 
20.  The monthly rent was $1,357.00
and the Landlord is holding
a rent deposit in the amount
of $1,357.00. The Tenant owes $7,552.20 in arrears to August 20, 2020, after
the rent deposit is deducted. The
Tenant also owes the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the L9
application. The total amount owed by the Tenant is $7,742.20.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order TSL-15713-20 issued
on October 15, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,552.20, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to August 20, 2020.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
