and evict Umar Moghal and Kanwal Sultan (the 'Tenants') because
a)

the rental unit or someone they permitted in the

undue damage to the premises. because

unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant; and because
c)     
the Landlord has entered
into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
The Landlords has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants

for the damage.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October
7, 2021.
The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative
Bruce Parsons, the Tenants and the
Landlord's Legal Representative Kimberley Farrell attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
commenced May 1, 2020.
 
2.    
Pursuant to
section 12.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for the
vast majority of tenancy
agreements, under section 2 of the Act, a tenancy agreement can be written, oral
or implied. However, after April 30, 2018 a landlord is now required to provide
all new tenancies entered into after April 30, 2018 a written tenancy agreement
completed on the LTB prescribed Standard Lease forms.
 
3.     Under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) parties
are free to negotiate and put
in leases any terms, provided they do not conflict with the Act or is otherwise
illegal. So were the Act does not say anything about issues Landlord(s) and
Tenant(s) are free to use written tenancy agreements to allocate
responsibilities for various items between the parties.




 
4.    
Subsection 3 (1) of the Act provides that the Act applies to
all matters with respect to rental units in residential complexes despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary.
5.    
Subsection 4(1) of the Act states
that a provision in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent
with the Act or the regulations is void.
 
6.     The Agreement to Lease entered
into between the Landlords and the Tenants
was not completed on the LTB
prescribed form. The copy provided was on TREB OREA Agreement to Lease 401
Form. In the agreement it stated:
The Tenant and the Landlord agree that
an accepted Agreement to Lease shall form a completed lease and no other lease will be
signed between the parties. This type of agreement is prohibited by the RTA.
 
7.     On July 9, 2021 the Landlords filed an application to end the tenancy based on a N5 and a N12 notice given to the Tenants.
 
8.     At the hearing,
the Landlord's Legal Representative requested that the portion
of the application relating
to the N5 notice and the damage claim be withdrawn.
 
9.     The portion of the application based on the N12 notice is under section 49(1)
of the
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (Act).
 
10.  Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
11.  On June 30, 2021 the Landlords gave the Tenants
a (N12) form notice to end the tenancy
because the purchaser required
possession of the rental unit. The termination date in the (N12) notice was
August 31, 2021.
 
12.  The Tenants did not vacate the rental
unit on August 31, 2021 in accordance with the termination
date set out in the notice given.
 
13.  The technical requirements for granting an application under section 49 of the Act are
a)    
was the N12 notice
properly given
 
b)    
the Landlord entered into a bonafide
Agreement of Purchase
and Sale
 
c)     
a
Declaration been filed by the Purchaser(s)
 
d)    
compensation paid to the Tenants pursuant
to the Act.
 
14.  Based on the testimonies given and documentary evidence submitted, I was satisfied the Landlords have met all the technical
requirements pursuant to section 49 of the Residential Tenancies Act.




15.  The Tenants sought
the termination of the tenancy
be postponed six-months to allow the Tenants’ additional time to find
alternative accommodation.
 
16.  The Landlords seek an order terminating the tenancy to coincide with the amended closing date of the APS now set
at October 9, 2021.
 
17.  The Purchaser Shakeel Khan attended and testified that
he has been given notice to vacate the rental
unit he and his spouse
currently occupy on or before October 15, 2021.
He further declared his spouse is pregnant and has a current due date of
December 28, 2021 to give birth.
 
18.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
December 31, 2021 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act to provide the Tenants with additional time to find
alternative accommodation and educational assistance for the Tenants children.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
December 31, 2021. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 31, 2021, then starting January 1, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 1, 2022.
