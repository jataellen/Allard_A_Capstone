Derek Gotthelf


Tenant



 
 
 
Ashok Chandler and Jinderi
Bhatoa (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Derek Gotthelf (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 964 1530 9097# on October 14, 2021.
The Landlord Jinderi Bhatoa, represented by Shikha Kapoor,
and the Tenant’s
representative Claudette Clark, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The rental unit is in the basement
of the Landlord’s home. The Tenant has resided in the
unit since January 2011. The
Landlords do not want to rent the basement out anymore and want to use the
space for themselves and require the space now that their children are getting
older.
 
2.    
The Tenant’s representative agues that the N12 notice
to terminate the tenancy was given in bad faith. The representative points to the four N12
notices that have been served on the Tenant that have been entered as evidence. She also points
to illegal attempts to raise
the monthly rent.
 
3.     The Landlord’s representative acknowledges that the Landlords served
defective notices on the
Tenant and that the Landlords asked for an increase in rent that was well above
the guideline.
 
4.     The Landlords’ representative submits that her clients
were attempting to deal with process without legal assistance and finally decided
to seek assistance after so many
mistakes were made.




 
5.    
The Tenant’s representative points to the fact the notices differ in who will use the rental unit space.
One notice indicates me, another is me and my child, and another
is me, my spouse and my child. Considering
the fact that it is the family that will use the space without a tenant in the basement, I can understand how these
differences could arise on the
notices.
 
6.     It is clear that the Landlords wanted
the Tenant to move out. The first
text about rent was
in 2019. The first N12 notice was
served nearly one year later. The
first notice was defective because it did not provide 60 days notice. However, I do not find that these attempts
to get the Tenant to move demonstrate bad faith.
 
7.    
Finally, the Tenant’s representative points the fact the declarations from the Landlords
do not include the words “in good faith”. Based on the testimony from the Landlords and their daughter,
who assisted with translating for her mother, I find the Landlord have
established they required the unit in good faith for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
8.     The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal
to one month's rent.
 
9.     Considering the length of the tenancy, I requested
submissions form the Tenant’s representative about delaying the termination of
the tenancy if the tenancy is to be terminated, as the Tenant was not present
to make submissions on relief for himself. Based on those submissions, and all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until June 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
10.  Considering the fact this tenancy
is being terminated and the Tenant bears no fault, I find
it fair that the Tenant be provided the option to terminate the tenancy at any
time before June 30, 2022, should he choose to do so. The Landlords are seeking an earlier termination and exercising
this option will provide the Landlords with the result they are seeking.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of June 30, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before June 30, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2022, then starting July 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after July 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant may terminate the tenancy earlier
than June 30, 2022 with 10 days written
notice to the Landlord.
