Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
File Number: CEL-65920-17











 
 
 

[Numbered company] (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict VE (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlords or another tenant (L2). 
 
The Landlord further applied for an order determining
whether the Tenant altered the locking system without their consent (L8).
 
This L1/L2/L8 application was heard in Mississauga on
April 26, 2017 and June 16, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, KG, the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, JU, and the Tenant attended the hearing on
April 26, 2017 and June 16, 2017.  The Tenant’s Legal Representative, AC,
attended only on June 16, 2017.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
This matter was adjourned
from the previous date as additional time was required for the Tenant to raise
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).   Interim order CEL-65920-17-IN was issued on April 26, 2017 instructing
the Tenant to provide the Landlord with a written description of all the issues
she intends to raise at the next hearing. 
2.     
At the beginning of the
hearing on June 16, 2017, there were disputes regarding whether or not the
parties have disclosed to each other any evidence they intend to submit at
today’s hearing.  In the end, it was determined that the Tenant was not raising
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Act and would simply be giving her
circumstances pursuant to section 83 of the Act. 
3.     
The Tenant disputed the
lawful rent for the unit.  The Tenant denied receiving the most recent N1
notice of rent increase from the Landlord and submitted that the rent has
increased over the tenancy without any notice of rent increase a few times.  
4.     
The parties were before the
Board in 2016, order CEL-57896-16 issued July 15, 2016 found the lawful rent to
be $2,500.00 per month at that time.  This order has not been reviewed or
appealed.  The Landlord submitted a copy of the N1 notice of rent increase and
a certificate of service confirming how the Tenant was served. 
5.     
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied that the lawful rent as of May 1, 2017 is $2,537.50 per
month.  The N1 notice for an increase for the guideline amount complied with
the Act.  Based on the Landlord’s Agent’s testimony and accompanying
certificate of service, I am satisfied that the Landlord served the N1 as
required by the Act.  Whether or not it came to the Tenant’s attention is not
required by the Act.
6.     
The Tenant did not dispute
the rent arrears owing as claimed in the application other than the arguments
above regarding lawful rent.  The Tenant disputes a secondary agreement with
the Landlord regarding the right to own the property.  The Tenant has since
filed an application in the Superior Court of Justice seeking specific findings
and remedies of that Court.  
7.     
In this application and the
previous application before the Board, the parties at present were found to be
that of Landlord and Tenant.  The Tenant maintains that she is the rightful
owner of the property and that the property was illegally purchased from her. 
This is the dispute at the higher Court.
8.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from September 1, 2016
to June 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective March 29, 2017.
9.     
The Tenant has paid
$5,000.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. 
Section 83
10.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
11.  
This is the second
application by the Landlord in less than one year to collect the rent arrears
that are currently substantial.  The Landlord is unable to financially maintain
this property.  The Landlord is required to pay the mortgage and the taxes
regularly while the Tenant continues to occupy the premises.
12.  
The Tenant requested that
the eviction be stayed or refused pending the outcome of the Superior Court of
Justice decision as it would be unfair for the Tenant to lose occupancy of the
premises whilst the argument for ownership proceeds at the Courts.
13.  
The Divisional Court in Lomico
188 Inc. v. David Mouritsen and Irina Mouritsen 2014 ONSC 2442 (CanLII) Div.
Crt. File No.: 541/13 has determined that the Board’s jurisdiction to hear
an application to terminate the tenancy for arrears of rent is not ousted by
reason of a pending action in the Superior Court involving the same tenancy.
14.  
The eviction order is
remedial upon payment of the rent owed in accordance with the signed tenancy
agreement between the parties.  This is the Tenant’s second application before
the Board within one year for substantial rent arrears.  The Tenant’s
application before the Superior Court of Justice was only filed in recent weeks. 

L2 application
15.  
The N5 notice of termination
at the root of this application was filed pursuant to section 64 of the Act. 
Subsection 64(1) of the Act states the following:
A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the
tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a
person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it
substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or
substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of
the landlord or another tenant.
16.  
The issue in the N5 notice is
regarding the Landlord inability to access the premises as the Tenant has
refused access, changed the lock and failed to provide a key to the Landlord. 
There was no dispute that the Tenant only recently provided the Landlord with a
key to the rental unit.
17.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am not satisfied that the Tenant has continued to refuse access to the
rental unit by the Landlord.  According to the Landlord a notice of entry was provided
to the Tenant, however she made a typographical error in the date.  Unfortunately,
given that the typographical error was the date of the notice, it stated May 5,
2017, and the notice simply stated that the Landlord requires entry in 24 hours,
I find that the Landlord’s attempt to enter on May 4, 2017 was not in compliance
with the notice.
Section 83
18.  
Having considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find
that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act given that the Landlord has obtained a key from the
Tenant.
L8 application
19.  
There was no dispute that
the Tenant complied with interim order CEL-65920-17 issued April 26, 2017 and
provided the Landlord with a key to the rental unit on May 3, 2017.  The
parties agreed that this issue was resolved.  Consequently the application is
dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2017.The amount of $5,000.00 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlords.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $19,171.01*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 19, 2017.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $83.42 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 20, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before June 30, 2017, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July
1, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2017, then starting July 1, 2017, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after July 1, 2017.
8.     
If, on or before June 30,
2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $20,265.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2017 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
10.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlords the amount of $5,000.00 together with any accrued interest.
