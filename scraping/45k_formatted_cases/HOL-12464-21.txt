Apollo Property Management Ltd.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Christine Okonjo (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. The
Landlord’s Agent, Donna Dames, the Tenant and the Tenant's
Representative, M. Bramson,
attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,795.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,795.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application was
filed.
 
6.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
