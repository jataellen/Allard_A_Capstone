Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24632-21



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 148 OSBORN
AVENUE BRANTFORD ON N3T6S1


 




Between:


Rock Solid Property Group Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Lori Feeney


 
Tenant



 
 
Rock Solid Property Group Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lori Feeney (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Agent, Nazim Ali, attended
the hearing. As of 11:10 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
4, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,650.00.
4.     The Tenant paid $1,400.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 19, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the
Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $5,588.78*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January 17, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,855.99** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
 
 
January 5, 2022 Date Issued
Southern-RO
119 King Street West,
6th Floor Hamilton ON L8P4Y7
