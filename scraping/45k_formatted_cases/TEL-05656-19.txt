Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-05656-19
 










 
 
 

(SG)
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (LA)ham
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 application’) and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on November 27, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
It
is determined that:
1.      The
Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed because it is based on a notice of
termination that is invalid on its face. 
2.      The
notice in question is in the Board’s Form N5. None of the boxes have been
checked off which means there is no indication as to whether the N5 is a notice
issued pursuant to ss. 62, 64, 67 or 68 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’). Although it contains particulars (which means the Tenant
would have known that it was about unpaid monies related to utilities), it does
not give any information to the Tenant about voiding as required by s. 64(2)(c),
nor does it indicate in any way which section of the Act the Landlord is
relying on.
3.      Pursuant
to s. 69 of the Act, an application like this one is based on a notice of
termination served in accordance with the Act. As the N5 here was not in
accordance with the requirements of the Act, the application must be dismissed.
The Board does not have the jurisdiction to evict a tenant based on an invalid
notice. 
4.      With
respect to the L1 application, the parties dispute the amount of rent owing. In
particular, they dispute how much the Tenant paid to the Landlord in the month
of July, 2019. 
5.      The
Tenant says that on July 3, 2019 the Landlord and her spouse were at the
residential complex cutting the grass and she paid to the Landlord $1,835.00 in
cash. She says that payment represents $1,035.00 she withdrew from her bank
account, $700.00 paid to her by her roommate, and $100.00 the Tenant borrowed. According
to the Tenant, both her roommate and her father were present when this occurred
and her roommate counted out the money for the Landlord. 
6.      The Tenant offers in
corroboration: a copy of her bank records showing withdrawals on July 2, 2019
totaling $1,035.00: and a letter from her roommate that says the roommate gave
$700.00 to the Tenant on July 3, 2019 and she saw the Tenant count all of the money
before handing it to the Landlord. 
7.      The
Landlord says the Tenant did not give her any cash on July 3, 2019. 
8.      There
is no dispute that on July 5, 2019 the Landlord told the Tenant that July's
rent was unpaid. When the Tenant replied that she paid it, the Landlord told
her she must have memory problems and to look for it.
9.      On
July 6, 2019 the Tenant texted the Landlord saying that she was looking for the
missing cash and could not find it in the house or in her dad's car. The Tenant
says she did this because she did not know what else to do or say. 
10.   The
next thing that happened was the Tenant paid $500.00 to the Landlord via
e-transfer on July 13, 2019. 
11.   Then
August rolled around. On August 4, 2019 the Tenant sent the Landlord a text
which explains the payment she was making that day. That explanation includes
July’s rent and deducts the $500.00 e-transfer but not the $1,835.00 allegedly
paid in cash on July 3, 2019. The Tenant says she did this because she could
not prove she paid the $1,835.00. 
12.   So
the question here is whether or not I believe the Tenant when she says she gave
the Landlord $1,835.00 in cash on July 3, 2019. 
13.   Given
all of the evidence before the Board, I am not satisfied that amount was paid.
I say this because the texts of July 6 and August 4, 2019 both contain statements
by the Tenant that contradict the assertion that money was paid. If the money
had been paid there was no reason for her to state she was looking for it; and
there was no logical reason why the Tenant would not have deducted it from the
balance owing on August 4, 2019. Although the Tenant offers explanations for
these texts, in the face of the Landlord’s denial and the absence of
corroborating testimony from the Tenant’s father or roommate, I am not prepared
to make a finding that the cash was paid. 
14.   I
would also observe that the bank records may show a withdrawal from the
Tenant’s account, but they do nothing to prove the amount was given to the
Landlord. 
15.   Further,
the letter from the Tenant’s roommate is hearsay so its contents must be given
little to no weight. If the Tenant wished to rely on her roommate’s evidence
she should have summonsed her to testify. I would also observe that the letter
actually contradicts the Tenant’s own oral testimony. The letter says the
Tenant counted out all of the money whereas the Tenant says her roommate did. 
16.   Given
all of the above I find that the rent arrears owing for the period ending
November 30, 2019 total $1,588.79 as of the date of hearing before the Board. 
17.   The
Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
18.   The
total amount owing under this order for the period ending November 30, 2019 is $1,778.79.
19.   The
lawful monthly rent is $1,800.00. 
20.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction in the form of
the repayment plan requested by the Tenant. I say this because the Landlord was
content to accept a payment plan whereby rent is paid on the first and arrears
are to be paid at the rate of $400.00 per month on or before the 20th
of the month until the balance owing is paid. 
21.   Please
note that the order below includes rent charged for the period ending July 31,
2020 due to the delay in issuance of this order. Any payments made after the
hearing held on November 27, 2019 must be deducted from the amount outstanding
in paragraph 1 below. 
22.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It
is ordered that:
1.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $16,178.79 LESS ANY PAYMENT MADE TO THE
LANDLORD BY THE TENANT FOR RENT AFTER THE HEARING HELD ON NOVEMBER 27, 2019.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out in paragraph 1 in
accordance with the following schedule:
(1)  $400.00
on or before the 20th day of each month starting July 20, 2020 and
continuing until the balance outstanding is paid.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full for the
period commencing December 1, 2019 and continuing until the balance owing under
paragraph 1 is paid.
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant,
apply to the Board within 30 days* of the Tenant’s breach pursuant to section
78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and
requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related charges
that became owing after November 30, 2019.
