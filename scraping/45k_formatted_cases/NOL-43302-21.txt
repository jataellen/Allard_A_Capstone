Pulkit Bhavsar and 2749765
Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Stephane Guy and Judy Jacasum (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone
the Tenants permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege
or interest of the Landlords or another Tenant. And because the Tenants have wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit or residential complex.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on October 25, 2021.
 
The Landlord, represented by their agent,
Pulkit Bhavsar, and the Tenant,
Stephanie Guy, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On May 27, 2021, the Landlords served the Tenants with an N5 Notice to
terminate the tenancy (the first ‘N5 Notice’)
pursuant to subsection 62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The
Termination date in the notice is June 3, 2021.
 
2.    
Subsection 62(2) of the Act sets out the required elements
for a valid N5 Notice: 62(2) A notice of termination
under this section shall,
(a)  provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after the notice
is given;
 
(b) 
set out the grounds
for termination; and
 
(c) 
require the tenant, within seven days,
 
(i)  
to repair the damaged
property or pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of repairing the damaged property,
or




File Number: NOL-43302-21
 
 
 
(ii)   
to replace the damaged property or
pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of replacing the damaged property,
if it is not reasonable to repair the damaged property. 2006, c. 17, s. 62 (2).
 
3.    
The termination date in the notice
is only 7 days after the N5 notice was served on the
Tenants. Because the Act requires
that the termination date on a first N5 notice be at least 20 days after the
notice is given, the Landlords’ N5 is defective.
 
4.    
In addition to the first N5 notice, the Landlord served
a second N5 notice on June 4, 2021
with a termination date of June 18, 2021. The
second N5 notice does not specify whether the notice is for a first or second
N5 notice and no reason is checked identifying the issue leading to the notice.
 
5.     If the second
notice was meant to be a second
N5 within the meaning of s. 68 of the Act,
it is invalid because the first N5 was invalid, and thus a condition precedent
under s. 68 was not satisfied. If it was meant to be first
N5 within the meaning of s. 62, it is invalid for failing to comply with s. 62(2) and
also because it does not have sufficient reasons and details as required by s.
43 of the Act.
 
6.     Having found both N5s to be invalid,
this application must
fail.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
