In the matter
of:


38 DONLEVY CRESCENT WHITBY ON L1R0B8


 




Between:


Sean Rambajan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Niclas Olsen


Tenant



 
 
Sean Rambajan
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Niclas
Olsen (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Sean Rambajan, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Bita Di Lisi, attended
the hearing. As of 11:01 a.m., the
Tenant was not present nor represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons that follow, I find that the Landlord,
in good faith, requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant will be
terminated as of February 13, 2022.
 
2.     On August 23, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant
with an N12 Notice of Termination (‘N12 notice’). The N12 notice stated that
the Landlord required the rental unit for residential occupation for his
parent. The N12 notice sought possession of the rental unit for October 31,
2021.
 
The Landlord’s “good faith”
intention
 
3.    
The N12 notice was served pursuant
to section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c.17
(the “Act”). The issue to be
determined by the Board is whether the Landlord has satisfied the “good faith”
requirement set out in subsection 48(1).
 
4.     The onus is on the Landlord to establish that the
Landlord, in good faith, has a genuine intention to occupy the premises. In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII
10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention
to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the landlord’s proposal.




 
 
 
5.    
In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001
CanLII 40231, the Divisional Court reaffirmed the decision in Feeney,
noting that the Landlord’s motives are ‘largely irrelevant’. In Fava v.
Harrison, 2014 ONSC 3352 (Div. Ct.) the Court held that while the motives
of the landlord are, per Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can
consider the conduct and motives of the Landlord to draw inferences as to
whether the Landlord desires, in good faith, to occupy the property.
 
6.     The Landlord submitted a Declaration that his mother,
Ritawatie Lall, in good faith requires the rental unit for her own personal use
for a period of at least one year. The
declaration provides that he intends to move his mother into the rental unit.
 
7.    
The Landlord also submitted a
Declaration signed by his mother stating that, in good faith, she requires the rental unit for her own personal use for
a period of at least one year.
 
8.    
The Landlord, in his uncontested
testimony, stated that his mother is currently living with him and his family. He further testified that the living space
is too small to continue to accommodate his mother.
 
9.     The Landlord’s mother attended the hearing and testified
that she requires a place to live that will allow her to live independently and
with privacy. She testified that she intends to live at the rental unit for at
least one year.
 
10.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Landlord
requires the unit in good faith so that his mother can move in and live there
for at least one year.
 
Compensation
 
11.  Section 48.1 of the Act requires a landlord seeking a
“personal use” eviction to provide compensation to their tenant
in an amount equal to one month’s
rent. Section 55.1 of the Act requires that the compensation be
paid by the landlord’s proposed termination date.
 
12.  The Landlord testified,
and submitted into evidence, a copy of a cheque in the amount of
$1900.00 which
was issued to the Tenant on October 6, 2021. The Landlord further testified
that the cheque was mailed to the Tenant on the same day. I accept the
Landlord’s undisputed evidence on this point.
 
13. 
I have considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant did
not attend the hearing, and thus I did not have the opportunity to hear any
evidence or submission from them relevant to my consideration under s. 83.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of February 13, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,872.18, which
represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021 to
February 2, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
from February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.
