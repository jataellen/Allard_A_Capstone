In the matter
of:


78 WALKER AVENUE TORONTO ON M4V1G2


 




Between:

Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


Brian Reid Moran David Wayne Howard


Landlord Agents



 
 
Ashina Manji and
Jameel Manji (‘the Tenants’) applied for an order determining that Brian Reid
Moran and David Wayne Howard
(‘the Landlord Agents’)
gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard via video conference on December
16, 2021.
 
The Tenant, Ashina Manji (‘A.M.’) and the Landlord’s Agent Brian Reid Moran Legal Representative, Ian Shemesh
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
It was determined that the Landlord’s Agent Brian Reid Moran is the property
manager of the property and
had no involvement with the issues in this application. As the parties consented to the amendment, the Landlord Agent
Brian Reid Moran is removed as a party from this proceeding.
 
2.     The Landlord Agent Brian Reid Moran’s Legal
Representative requested costs be awarded to compensate them because they had to prepare for this hearing
and attend this hearing.
 
3.     Section 204 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, provides that:
 
•        
The Board may order
a party to an application to pay the costs of another
party.
•        
The Board may order that its costs of a proceeding be paid by a party or the party’s paid representative.
•        
The amount
of any order for costs
shall be determined in accordance with the Rules.




 
 
 
 
4.    
As set out in the Board’s
Guidelines, costs may be ordered
where a party’s conduct in the
proceeding was unreasonable. Based on
the submissions at the hearing, I do not find that the Tenants’ conduct was
unreasonable and therefore, no costs will be awarded.
 
5.     The Tenants’ application asserts that the Landlord
served the N12 notice in bad faith as they had listed the house for sale and never had the intention of residing in the rental
unit for residential purposes, for a period of at least one year; it was
always the Landlord’s intention to sell the house.
 
6.     The Tenants rented a semi-detached, three story residence
from the Landlord.
It had three bedrooms and four
bathrooms, with the rent being $7,250.00 per month. The Tenants moved into the rental unit on November 15, 2016.
 
7.     The Tenants were served with a N12 notice to terminate tenancy
for Landlord’s own use
on May 27, 2019. The date of
termination was indicated to be July 31, 2019 but the Tenants moved out of the
rental unit on August 31, 2019.
 
8.     The Tenants allege
that the Landlord
never moved into the rental
unit and that the
property was listed for sale on October 1, 2019 and sold November 28, 2019 for
$3,110,00.00.
 
9.     A.M. testified that they actually
believed the property
was listed for sale while they were still residing in the rental unit as
they were asked three times to leave the rental unit for showings
prior to receiving the N12 notice to terminate on May 27, 2019 and that they
observed the property listed as a private listing on Sotheby’s Real Estate.
 
10.  A.M. testified that the Landlord told her he had
received an unsolicited offer so he asked the Tenants to leave the rental unit
for two hours on May 15, 2019. The Landlord requested that the Tenants leave
the rental unit again on May 18, 2019 from 12pm to 2pm. The Tenants
accommodated the requested and returned home to find the home staged, the children’s belongings were put away,
dirty dishes that had food on them were
put into the dishwasher and there were flowers put out. There was also a bottle of wine and a real estate agent’s
business card left on the dining room table with a thank you note.
 
11.  A.M. stated that she is very close to the next door
neighbours and upon vacating the rental unit in August, 2019, she was told that people were coming in to view the property
and there were indications that the house was being prepared for sale.
 
12.  A.M. stated that her brother-in-law is a realtor
and saw that the rental
unit was in fact
listed for sale in October, 2019.
 
13.  As a result of vacating the rental unit due to the N12
notice to terminate, the Tenants moved to a detached home in East York as they
could not find a similar house in the same neighbourhood. The new home is not on the subway line whereas the old rental unit was. This was especially
important to A.M. as she said she did not own a vehicle.




 
The new rental unit was described
as being similar to the old rental unit except the new rental has an additional
bedroom and an additional bathroom. A.M. stated that she now pays $8,250.00 per month in rent
instead of $7,250 per month, an increase of $1,000.00
per month.
 
 
Was the Notice to terminate given in bad
faith?
 
14.  Pursuant to section
57(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c17 (the ‘Act’), the Board may make an
order against a landlord if, on application by a former tenant of a rental
unit, the Board determines that,
 
(a) the landlord gave a notice
of termination under section 48 in bad faith, the former tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of the notice … and no person referred to in clause 48 (1) (a),
(b), (c) or (d) occupied the rental unit within a reasonable time after the
former tenant vacated the rental unit.
 
15.  Subsection 57(1) (a) of the Act establishes a three-part test. In order to be successful in their T5 application, the Tenants must
establish all three of the requirements of subsection 57(1)(a) on a balance of
probabilities:
 
•        
First, that the Landlord
gave a notice of termination under section 48 of the Act (the N12 notice) in bad faith;
•        
Second, that the Tenant vacated
the rental unit as a result of the N12 notice or Board order based on the
N12 notice;
•        
Third, that the person
named in the N12 notice
did not move into the rental
unit within a reasonable time after the Tenant vacated.
16.  On an application to the Board, the person who alleges
a particular event occurred has the burden
of proof to establish that it
is more likely than not that their version of events is true. In this application, the burden typically
falls on the Tenant to establish that the notice of termination was served in bad
faith.
 
17.  However, the fact that the rental unit was
listed for sale shortly after the time the N12 notice was served creates
a rebuttable presumption that the Landlord
served the N12 notice in bad faith. In other words,
in this case, the burden falls on the Landlord to establish whether or not the
rebuttable presumption applies.
 
Rebuttable Presumption of Bad Faith
 
18.  Subsections 57(5) and 57(6) of the
Act establishes a rebuttable presumption of bad faith on the following ground:
 
(5)  
For the purposes of an application
under clause (1)(a), it is presumed, unless the contrary is proven on a
balance of probabilities, that a landlord gave a notice of termination under section 48 in bad faith, if at any time during the period described in subsection
(6) the landlord,




 
… (c) advertises the rental unit, or the building that contains the rental
unit, for sale;
(6)  
The period referred to in subsection (5) is the period that,
(a)  
begins on the day the landlord
gives the notice
of termination under section
48; and
(b)  
ends one year after the former
tenant vacates the rental unit.
19.  Absent evidence from the Landlord,
the only reasonable conclusion that can be reached
is that the notice was given
in bad faith. The rental
unit was on the market
to be sold just a few
months after vacant possession was returned to the Landlord.
 
20.  As a result, I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that on May 27, 2019 the Landlord gave a notice of termination
under section 48 in bad faith, the Tenants vacated the rental unit as a result
of that notice, and the Landlord or a member of his family did not move into the rental unit within a reasonable time after the Tenants vacated
the rental unit.
 
21.  That leaves the question of what remedies
the Tenants are entitled to. The application asks for rent differential
and moving costs.
 
22.  With respect to the request for rent differential the
relevant wording in s. 57(3)1(i) is that the
Board may order the Landlord
to pay the Tenants “all or any portion of any increased rent that the former tenant has
incurred or will incur for a one-year period after vacating
the rental unit”.
 
23.  I am satisfied the Tenants are entitled to an order
with respect to rent differential. The difference in rent that the Tenants
are paying is an extra $1,000.00 per month however, the Tenants’ new rental unit is
larger than the old one, in that there is one additional bedroom and one
additional bathroom. In other words, the two units are not directly comparable. Some of the increase in rent being paid for the new unit must be attributed
to the fact it is larger.
So, I believe the Tenants
are entitled to an order for rent differential
over a one year period of $8,400.00 which is a rent difference of $700.00 per
month.
 
24.  The Tenants requested
that the Board grant a reimbursement of expenses related to moving. The Tenant
claims $700.00 representing costs incurred for movers and
$350.00 as the cost to “baby proof” their new home. The Board finds that the moving expenses were not proven by the
Tenants and this claim is denied.
 
25.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
$8,400.00. This amount
represents rent differential
of $700.00 per month for a twelve month period.
 
2.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants $50.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount the Landlord
owes the Tenants
is $8,450.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord shall pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February
12, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing by February 12, 2022
they will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February
13, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
6.     The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
