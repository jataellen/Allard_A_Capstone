Abigail
Piercey Tyler Coote


Tenants



 
 
 
Interrent c/o CLV Group Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Abigail Piercey and Tyler Coote (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Elena Jacob, attended
the hearing. As of 10:34 a.m. the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December
1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective July 28, 2021.
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,384.00.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.    
The application is
amended to reflect that the Tenants paid $2,390.00 towards the period
01/07/2021 to 31/07/2021. Accordingly, the arrears
owing on the date the application was filed were $1,993.65.
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,384.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 25, 2020 to December
31, 2020.




File Number: SOL-24589-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is
terminated as of October 31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant possession
of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $2,033.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the
full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
