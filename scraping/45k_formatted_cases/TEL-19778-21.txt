Sean Mitradeo and Maynard
Mitradeo (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Clint Neilson (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 25, 2022.
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.       
The Landlords served the Tenant with an N12 Notice
to Terminate the tenancy because the Landlord requires the unit.
 
2.       
The N12 filed with the Board has a termination date of August
30, 2021.
 
3.       
Section 48(2) of the Act states that the date for termination specified
in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is
given and shall be the last day of the rental period or, where the tenancy is
for a fixed term, the end of the term.
 
4.       
A
notice of termination cannot be amended
after it has been served
and a tenancy cannot be
terminated based on a defective notice of termination.
 
5.       
The Landlord testified at the hearing
that rent was due on the
first of every month and that       the
tenancy agreement between the Landlords and the Tenant is a monthly tenancy.

6.       
The Landlords did not provide
the correct termination date on the notice because August has 31 days in the month. The
Landlord’s notice is therefore defective because the termination date is not at
the end of the rental period.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlords' application is dismissed.
