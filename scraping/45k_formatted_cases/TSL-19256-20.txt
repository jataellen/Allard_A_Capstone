Montcrest Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Lee Taylor (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on February 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative Matt Anderson and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December
9, 2020.
 
2.     The monthly rent was $1,449.95.
 
3.     The parties agree the Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on December
31, 2020.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,449.95 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 9, 2020.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated effective December
31, 2020.




File Number: TSL-19256-20
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,056.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December
31, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing, $6,242.99* on or before March 18, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from March 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
