Order under Section 68
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23697-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


7, 2086 MEADOWBROOK ROAD BURLINGTON ON L7P2A4


 




Between:


First Rock Properties Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Evelyn Morton


Tenant



 
 
 
First Rock Properties Ltd (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Evelyn Morton
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October
27, 2021. The Landlord’s agent, Emily Veeneman
(EV), and the Tenant’s legal representative, Dawn Carr, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant raised
a preliminary issue
with the Landlord’s notice(s) of termination.
 
2.     This application
was filed on August 6, 2021 and is based on a second notice
of termination N5.
 
3.     The Landlord’s evidence
was that she served a second notice of termination on August 6, 2021 with the termination date of August 6,
2021. EV stated that she attempted to correct the second N5 by
serving it on August 6, 2021 but with a different termination date after
realizing that she could not have the same termination date as the date it was
given. EV was unable to find this “corrected” N5 at the hearing. The Board’s
file only has one N5 notice of termination signed on August 6, 2021. It has a
termination date of August 6, 2021, which matches the termination date
indicated in the Landlord’s application. The Landlord bears the burden of proof
in this application and I do not find that the Landlord demonstrated that it is
more likely than not that a “corrected” valid notice of termination was given
to the Tenant on August 6, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord also served a notice of termination on July 23, 2021 with a termination date of July 30, 2021.




File Number: SOL-23697-21
 
5.    
The notices of
termination the Landlord is attempting to rely upon are given under s. 68(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’). S. 68(2) of the Act requires
that a notice of termination
under s. 68(1) have a termination date of not earlier than the 14th day after the notice is given.
 
6.     Neither of the two notices
of termination the Landlord attempted
to rely upon comply with
s. 68(2) of the Act as they both have a termination date of less than 14 days from the date they were given. They are
therefore invalid and the Landlord’s application to terminate this tenancy
based on these notices can’t succeed.
 
7.     The Landlord also served a first notice of termination
N5 with a termination date of June 24, 2021. Under
s. 69(2) of the Act the Landlord may only apply for an order
terminating a tenancy and evicting a tenant no more than 30 days after the termination date specified
in the notice. The Landlord cannot rely on this notice of termination even if
it is otherwise valid because the application was filed on August 6, 2021,
which is more than 30 days from the date of termination indicated in this
notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
January 25, 2022                                                                                                                                                Date Issued                                                                      Vladimir Nikitin
