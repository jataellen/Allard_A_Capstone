In the matter
of:


509, 250 BRENYON
WAY TORONTO ON M1B3G3


 




Between:


Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Hayle
  Roy Hayle


Tenants



 
 
 
Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Richard Hayle and Roy Hayle (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
way of video conference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord’s legal representative Bryan Rubin, the
Tenant Richard Hayle and the Tenant’s legal representative Christopher Lin
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,236.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from March 1, 2002 to
September 16, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $4,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The Tenant does not dispute
the amount of rent arrears
owing. The Tenant testified that his father and joint Tenant was
transferred to a long-term care home in the summer of 2021 and as such was no
long contributing his income to the monthly rent.
 
6.     The Tenant has lived in the rental
unit for approximately 20 years and his only source of income is from ODSP. The Tenant is unable to pay the full
monthly rent on his own.




 
7.    
The Tenant testified that as of
December 2021 he has found a new roommate who can assist him in paying his
monthly rent. The Tenant proposed a
repayment plan in which the Tenant would pay the full monthly rent on the first
day of each month, plus an additional $64.00 towards
the monthly rent. The payment
plan would run from January
1, 2021 to October 1, 2026.
 
8.     The Tenant acknowledges that the payment
plan is lengthy, but argues that in the 20
years of being a Tenant, there have been no prior applications filed by the
Landlord against the Tenant.
 
9.     The Tenant’s legal representative advised that the
Tenant has been in contact with the Eviction
Prevention in the Community program
(EPIC), who may provide the Tenant with a one-time loan to assist in paying
his arrears sooner. As of the date of
the hearing the Tenant had not been approved for any loan or assistance and is
currently awaiting a decision from EPIC.
 
10.  The Landlord’s legal representative acknowledged that
this is a long-term tenancy but argued that a 4-year
payment plan would be unfair
to the Landlord. The Landlord’s legal representative also argued that there is no guarantee that
the Tenant’s new roommate will continue to reside in the rental unit or
contribute to the monthly rent throughout the proposed payment plan period.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
12.  I would agree with the Landlord’s legal representative
that the Tenant’s very lengthy payment plan is dependent on the Tenant’s
roommate continuing to reside in the rental unit and willing to contribute
towards the rent. However, I am also
alive to the fact that the Tenant has resided in the rental
unit for approximately 20 years and is making
every effort to preserve the Tenancy.
 
13.  The extended termination date is fair to both parties
as it will allow the Tenant some additional time to either find alternate
housing or to continue to apply to rent relief programs such as the Rent Bank or EPIC, while
the Landlord will still continue
to receive ongoing rent
payment from Tenant.
 
14.  This Order contains
all the reasons
for this matter.
No further reasons
will issue.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,400.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022, less
the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$40.64 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before April
30, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 30, 2022, then starting May 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$3,646.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$4,882.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
iii)            
$6,118.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 31, 2022, or
iv)           
$7,354.00 if the payment
is made on or before
April 30, 2022**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make
a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after May 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
