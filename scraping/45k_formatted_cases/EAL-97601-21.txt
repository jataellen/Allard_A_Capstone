Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97601-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


718 FRONT STREET PEMBROKE ON K8A6J5


 




Between:


Blair Johnson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lauryn Parker


Tenant



 
 
Blair Johnson (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lauryn Parker (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 970 9628 3000#
on January 19, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord failed to pay the Tenant compensation
equal to one month’s rent on or before October 31, 2021, being the termination
date set out in the N12 notice of termination,
contrary to the requirement set out in section of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
2.    
The Landlord indicated that he had understood that the compensation payment had to be
effected by the termination date contained in the requested termination order
from the Board and intended to make that payment. He had not understood that
the deadline for that payment was the October 31, 2021 date in the N12 notice
of termination. He acknowledged that he had neither provided a direct payment
to the Tenant nor indicated to her, prior to the October 31, 2021 termination
date, that he was waiving one month’s rental arrears attributable to a period
prior to October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
In light of the non-compliance with section 55.1 of the Act, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.




File Number: EAL-97601-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application to terminate the tenancy is dismissed.
