Omik Lalitchandra Patel (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Vevyan
Nissan, Jan Shemsdin and Mary Cejo (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October
7, 2021.
Only the Landlord and the Landlord's Legal Representative
Ramadevi Gavisetty attended
the hearing.
As of 11:15 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.

in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.     On June 16, 2021 the Landlord served the Tenants
a (N12) Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•

(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.

(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given

11.  Based on the uncontested application, and after
considering all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection

to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. The deposit shall be applied to the
