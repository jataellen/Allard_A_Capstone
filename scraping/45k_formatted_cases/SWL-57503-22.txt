Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57503-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


C,
  39 EMPIRE ST LONDON ON N5Y1G6


 




Between:


Amiraco Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Charles Ritchie
  Debora Ritchie


Tenants



 
 
 
Amiraco Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Debora
Ritchie and Charles Ritchie (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on September 23,
2021 with respect to application SWL-51693-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenant did not pay $600.00 on or before December 15, 2021. The Tenant did not
pay $914.54 rent on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $6,120.72 for rent
arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order SWL-51693-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $4,404.34 and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous order SWL-51693-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: SWL-57503-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-51693-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,920.22*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$30.07 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 21, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
January 20, 2022                                                                             Date Issued                                                                      Kathleen Wells

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
