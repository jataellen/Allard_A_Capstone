Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57528-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


11248 CULLODEN ROAD AYLMER ON N5H 2R3


 




Between:


Peter Retsinas


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alicia Wagner
  Henry Blatz


Tenants



 
 
 
Peter Retsinas (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alicia Wagner and Henry
Blatz (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
July 30, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49539-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants did not pay $1,836.00 (arrears) on or before August 20, 2021.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $5,836.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-49539-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $36.00.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-49539-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,336.16* (less
any amounts paid by the Tenant after the filing of the L4 application). This amount represents the rent owing
up to January 21, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for
the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$37.15 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting January 22, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 2, 2022.
