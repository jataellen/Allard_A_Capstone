In the matter
of:


23, 100 TAUNTON ROAD
E OSHAWA ON L1G7N1


 




Between:


Taunton Co-Tenancy Limited
c/o Realstar Management
  Partnership


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Courtney Mclean
  Edward Ong


Tenants



 
 
 
Taunton Co-Tenancy Limited c/o Realstar Management Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Courtney Mclean and Edward Ong (the
'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 25, 2022.
 
Only Kimberly Szorady on behalf of the Landlord, and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Faith McGregor, attended the hearing. As
of 10:15 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the particulars contained in the N8 Notice of Eviction served
to the Tenant by mail on
October 15, 2021, I find that from November 2020 to October 15, 2021, the
Tenant was late paying the rent 6 months out of the 12-month period.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative advised that the since the application was file the Tenant was
late paying the rent in November 2021 and January 2022; there are no arrears
owing. The Representative also advised that due to the persistent late rent the
Landlord is seeking the standard 11-day order for termination and the
application filing fee. When queried
as to what prejudice there
would be to the Landlord
with a pay-on-time order with a breach clause, the Representative
agreed there would not be any prejudice and
suggested aa 12 month conditional order pay-on-time order,
for the first
business day of the month.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to




File Number: TEL-20336-21
 
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. A conditional pay on time order
does not prejudice the Landlord.
 
4.     This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay the lawful rent to the Landlord in full and on time for the period
March 2022 through February 2023, on the first business day of each month.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before March 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the Tenant fails to make any
payments in accordance with paragraph 1, the Landlord may apply under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1 of
this order.
