Statutory Powers Procedure Act
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-90156-20-RV
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3775 GREGOIRE RD RUSSELL ON K4R1E5


 




Between:


Marc Charron


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rick Dignard


Tenant



 
 
 
Marc Charron
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Rick Dignard (the 'Tenant') to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord
also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
The application was resolved by order EAL-90156-20 issued on October
14, 2021.
 
On October 25,
2021 the Tenant requested that order EAL-90156-20 issued on October 14, 2021, be reviewed and that the order be stayed until the Tenant's
request to review
the order is resolved.
 
On November
16, 2021 order EAL-90156-20-RV-IN was issued referring
the request for a review to a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord has
submitted an Advance Resolution Request on December 6, 2021 to request to withdraw the applications. There is a hearing scheduled
for January 20, 2022.
 
2.   
The Landlord
and the Tenant both confirmed
the consent to withdraw the Review Request and the underlying order based on
an agreement between the parties to fully and finally resolve all issues
between them.
 
3.   
In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the application.




File Number: EAL-90156-20-RV
 
4.   
The request for review
has become moot, given that the Board has consented to the Landlord’s request
to withdraw the applications. Therefore, the reasons for the review need no longer be considered.
 
 
5.   
The order EAL-90156-20 issued on October
14, 2021 is replaced by this order and may not be enforced.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The interim
order EAL-90156-20-RV-IN issued
on November 16, 2021 is cancelled.
 
2.   
The landlord’s application is dismissed, the file closed,
and the January 20, 2022 hearing
is cancelled.
 
 
 
January 11, 2022 Date Issued
