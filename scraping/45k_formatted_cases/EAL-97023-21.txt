Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97023-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      2, 631 ST FELIX STREET
CORNWALL ON K6H5B4

Debbie Brunet Megan Derouchie


Tenants




 
 
 
Ganeshalingam Veluppillai (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Debbie Brunet and Megan Derouchie (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Agent, Shelley Albers attended the hearing. As of 10:17 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 5, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of
January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$759.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $4,509.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I am not satisfied that the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant. The
Tenant has been making payments to the Landlord and has reduced the arrears
claimed in the L1

application by more than half. Postponing the eviction will allow the Tenant to void this order or make alternate housing
arrangements.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,039.70*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 26, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $24.95
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,336.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$2,095.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
