Guelph Line Seniors Non-profit
Residential Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Heidi Robinson (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on November 30, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-15588-20-RV.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: On or about January 15, 2022, the Tenant was
observed leaving bags around the common areas.
On the same day, the Tenant was observed letting
strangers into the building, and allowing them to loiter in the lobby,
hallway, and laundry room.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 26, 2022, then starting
February 27, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.
