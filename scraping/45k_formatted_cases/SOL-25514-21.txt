Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25514-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1211, 20 EMERALD STREET
N HAMILTON ON L8L8A4


 




Between:


DMS Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jan Sivak


Tenant



 
DMS Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jan Sivak (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 8, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As of 10:27 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $139.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00 for a cheque tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $560.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25514-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $219.21*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
14, 2022 and the total charges related
to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the
Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $4.57
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 15, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$476.02 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$615.02 if the payment is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the
amount required under that
subsection on or after April 1, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
