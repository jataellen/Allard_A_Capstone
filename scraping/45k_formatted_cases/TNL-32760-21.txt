In the matter
of:


608, 25 RICHVIEW ROAD TORONTO ON M9A4Y3


 




Between:


H&r Property Management Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Richard Sbalqueiro
  Sbalqueiro Costa


Tenants



 
 
 
H&r Property Management Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sbalqueiro Costa and Richard
Sbalqueiro (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 3, 2021.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant’s Legal Representative, Luisa
Goncalves, Tenant, Richard Sbalqueiro, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,929.18
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to May 19, 2021.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. The Tenant submitted that
he tried to enter into a sublet agreement with the Landlord
and the Landlord unjustly refused to allow the sublet. This is an L1 application for arrears of rent unpaid.
The Tenant stated that there is a pending Tenant application regarding the
sublease agreement, however this application is not before the Board.
Consequently, any matters related to the sublease agreement cannot be argued in
this application. The Tenant admits that
he still




File Number: TNL-32760-21
 
has a tenancy agreement with the
Landlord and that he failed to pay his rent in full. The Tenant testified that
he is in Brazil and cannot return to Canada because Air Canada cancelled his
flight. The Tenant further testified that it costs over $10,000.00 for him to
return to Canada. I acknowledge the difficult situation that the Tenant is in,
however it does not relieve
him of his obligations under the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord. If the Tenant is unable to return to
Canada, he is expected to make arrangements
to have his rent paid to the Landlord in his absence if he wishes to
retain the rental unit. The Tenant failed to pay his rent while away in Brazil.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $21,214.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.25 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting February
5, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$23,634.57 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$25,588.74 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
