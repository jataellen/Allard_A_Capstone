Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
 
Paul Enqvist (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Roxanne Johnson (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.
 
This application was resolved
by order NOL-44034-21 & NOL-44147-21, issued
on January 13, 2022.
 
On January 31, 2022, the Tenant
requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
2.     The Tenant disputes the Board’s conclusion that the
Tenant, her guest or another occupant of the rental unit, caused undue damage to the property.
The Tenant, however, did not attend the January 10,
2022 hearing, and does not provide an explanation for her absence in the review
request.




File Numbers:
NOL-44034-21-RV
NOL-44147-21-RV
3.     The Board’s review process is not an opportunity to re-argue an application that has been determined. The Tenant’s opportunity to challenge the Landlord’s applications was at the January 10, 2022 hearing. Since the Tenant did not demonstrate they
were not reasonably able to participate in that hearing, their review request
must be denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order NOL-44034-21 & NOL-44147-21, issued
on January 13, 2022, is denied. The order is
confirmed and remains unchanged.
