Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-75747-16
 










 
 
 

B.L.H.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict D.O.
and C.Y. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 25, 2017.
 
The Landlord’s representative, B.R., and the second-named Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective November 30, 2016.
2.     
The arrears of rent owing for the period ending January 31, 2017, total
$4,055.37.
 
3.     
The Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application
in the amount of $170.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,162.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2016 to
November 30, 2016, in the amount of $13.63.
6.      The
Tenants paid $578.63 after the application was filed.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 14,
2017, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
8.      The
Tenant says that he has found himself in arrears because, unbeknownst to him,
the first-named Tenant was not paying her share of the rent. 
9.      The
Tenant says that he understands that he cannot afford the rental unit on his
own and he is eager to leave, he simply needs some additional time to find
alternate accommodations. The Tenant says he is able to move out of the rental
unit by February 14, 2017. 
10.   The
Landlord is requesting a standard eviction order which would see this Tenant
evicted within 11 days from the date of this order. Based on the unfortunate
circumstances that the Tenant has found himself and based on the fact that he
is asking for a delay of only 7 days, I am satisfied that it would not be
unfair to delay this eviction until February 14, 2017.  
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 14, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,933.34*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 27, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $38.20 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 28, 2017 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 7, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 8, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2017, then starting February
15, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 15,
2017.
8.      If
the Tenants wish to void this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,225.37 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2017, or
ii)       $5,387.37 if the payment is made on or before February 14, 2017**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after February 15, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to
the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
