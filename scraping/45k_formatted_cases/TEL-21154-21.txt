Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21154-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1217, 225 MARKHAM
ROAD TORONTO ON M1J3C6


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kiruthiga Krishnarajah


Tenant



 
 
Capreit Limited
Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kiruthiga Krishnarajah (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued
by the Board on October 20,
2021 with respect to application TEL-15606-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: the Tenant did not pay $6,000.00 on
or before October 31, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $15,317.13 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-15606-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $12,016.13 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-15606-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid the rent for November 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,805.60 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TEL-21154-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2020 to January 12, 2022. There is no interest owing for 2021 because the rent
increase amount for 2021 was 0.00%.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The previous
order TEL-15606-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 23, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$10,193.17*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $59.36
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.
