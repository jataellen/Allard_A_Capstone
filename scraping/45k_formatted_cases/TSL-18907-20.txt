Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-18907-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


403, 140
THE ESPLANADE TORONTO ON
  M5A4P5


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christine a.k.a. Christopher Newman Darlene Genoway


Tenants



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Darlene
Genoway and Christine a.k.a. Christopher Newman (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on
December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Dale Maingot, attended the
hearing. As of 4:17 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
The Landlord’s claim for the period ending December 31, 2021 exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord indicated a desire to proceed
with the hearing of the application and voluntarily waived the portion of the
claim that exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2019 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 13, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,515.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,366.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2020 to February 13, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 19,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
7.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $40,709.33** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




 
8.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 19, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
