Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
requiring Mir-babak Hashemi
and Bahareh Badri (the
'Tenants') to pay the rent that they owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 7, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Lila Durmford, attended the hearing. As of 11:25 a.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants did not pay the total rent they were required
to pay for the period from May 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on July 31, 2020. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,625.67.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Tenant
paid a last month’s rent deposit in the amount
of $1,625.67. The Landlord
owes the Tenant $20.86 in interest on the deposit. The amount of $1,646.53 will
be deducted from the final amount determined to be outstanding.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$2,226.81, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to July 31, 2020 less the last month’s rent deposit and interest.

owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 9, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
