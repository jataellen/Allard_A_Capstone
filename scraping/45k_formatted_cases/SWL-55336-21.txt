Konrad Piotrowski (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin Neill (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 27, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
It is determined that:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 20, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,600.00.
 
4.     The Landlord incurred
costs of $186.00
for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a rent deposit.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $4,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     The amount outstanding to January 31, 2022, inclusive of rent arrears
and costs, is
$9,786.00.

8.    
At the hearing, the Landlord offered
to forgive half of the outstanding arrears
as long as the Tenant moved out on or before
February 28, 2022. The Tenant accepted the Landlord’s offer.
 
9.    
This order contains all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant will pay the monthly rent of $1,600.00 for February 2022 on or before
February 10, 2022.
 
3.     The Landlord will forgive half of the outstanding balance
of $9,786.00, which
means the Tenant shall pay
the Landlord $4,893.00, as long as the Tenant has vacated the rental unit
on or before February 28, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not vacate the rental unit on or before February
28, 2022 then the
amount outstanding of $9,786.00 shall become due on March 1, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
