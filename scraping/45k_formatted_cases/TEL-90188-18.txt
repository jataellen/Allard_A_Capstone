H.T.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict J.M. and A.D. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Peterborough on May 3,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, G.G.,
and the Tenants attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to
May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 9, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $2,900.00. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $175.00 for
the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from September 1, 2013 to April 9, 2018,
in the amount of $62.97.
6.     
The Tenants have lived in
the rental unit for 5 years. However, the first-named Tenant moved out of the
rental unit months ago and the second-named Tenant now lives with his 16 year
old daughter in the unit. 
7.     
Since the first-named Tenant
moved out, there is no dispute that the second-named Tenant can no longer
afford the rental unit. An analysis at the hearing of his monthly income and
expenses confirms that the second-named Tenant can not afford to live in the
unit and can not afford to pay off the growing amount of arrears. 
8.     
The Landlord’s
representative says this eviction process has actually been going on since
January 2018.  However, the Landlord’s previous applications were dismissed for
technical reasons. 
9.     
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied that the Tenant has known about this pending eviction for
quite some time and it is clear that he can not afford to live in the rental
unit. For these reasons, it would be unfair to allow this tenancy to continue
any longer. 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 2,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,675.70*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 22, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 23, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 2, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 3,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 2, 2018, then starting June 3, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 3, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $3,075.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,975.00 if the payment is made on or before June 2, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 3, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
