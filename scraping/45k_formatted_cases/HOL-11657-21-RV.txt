In the matter

Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Drewlo Holdings Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order requiring Wafai Wierzbicki (the 'Tenant')
to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order HOL-11657-21 issued on December 10, 2021.
On January 17, 2022 the Tenant requested a review of the order.
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s request to review claims
that there is a serious
error.
 
2.    
As noted above, on application the Landlord sought an order requiring the Tenant to pay
the rent that the Tenant owed.
 
3.     The Tenant’s request to review does not raise any
issue with respect to the hearing Member’s interpretation of or application of the law. Nor does the request
to review raise any issue with respect to the
hearing Member’s findings of fact. Rather, the request to review asserts facts
about pets in the residential complex, cigarette smoke and the effects of the
pets and cigarette smoke on the Tenant and his family.
 
4.     Giving the request
to review a liberal reading,
it appears that the Tenant
is claiming that there is a serious error because the
hearing Member did not consider issues that the Tenant could have raised under
subsection 87(2) of the Act, which permits tenants to raise any issue that
could be a subject of an application under the Act.




File Number: HOL-11657-21
 
5.     The problems with the Tenant’s request to review are
that the Tenant did not attend the hearing and that the request to review
provides no explanation for the Tenant’s absence. In these circumstances, and
in circumstances where the Board’s record reveals that the Tenant provided no
information prior to the hearing that the Tenant intended to raise any issues under subsection 87(2) of the Act, it cannot be said that the hearing
Member erred in failing to
consider issues that were not before her.
 
6.     In the circumstances, the only reasonable inference available to me is that the Tenant did not attend the hearing due to a lack
of diligence.
 
7.     The Divisional Court in Q Res IV Operating GP Inc. v. Berezovs’ka, 2017 ONSC 5541 (CanLII) provides the following guidance:
 
If parties are not diligent in dealing with legal proceedings then they cannot
demand that a Tribunal waste its resources by rehearing matters a second
time. To allow this would undermine
the ability of the administration of justice to deliver timely, cost-effective
and final orders.
 
8.     On the basis of the submissions made in the request,
and where there is no assertion that the Tenant was not
reasonably able to participate in the proceeding, I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order HOL-11657-21 issued on
December 10, 2021 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
