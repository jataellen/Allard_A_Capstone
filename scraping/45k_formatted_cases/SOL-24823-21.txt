Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24823-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


RC15, 150 SANFORD
AVENUE N HAMILTON ON L8L5Z6


 




Between:


Live Well Property Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Eugene
  Earle


Tenant



 
 
 
Live Well Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Eugene Earle (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent
Matt Christie, attended
the hearing. As of 11:35
a.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,200.85.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,200.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 31, 2020 to August 26, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $5,000.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$14.56*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $39.48
per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 18,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,895.35** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
