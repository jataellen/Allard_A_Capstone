Elton
Schebesch (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order determining that Marcel Patey (the 'Tenant') abandoned the rental unit.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 1:29 p.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented although
properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order determining that the
Tenants abandoned the unit on September 17, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The Landlord testified that he
served three notices of entry on the Tenant and did not receive a response. On
September 17, 2021, he attended the unit and he saw that there was garbage,
Christmas decorations, pots and pans and the windows were covered with plastic bags.
He inquired from the Tenant’s
neighbours if they had seen him, to which they replied they had not. He cleaned the
unit on October 1, 2021 and stored the Tenant’s belongings. The Landlord had
not heard from the Tenant regarding the unit or his belongings to date.
 
4.    
I
am satisfied the Tenant
abandoned the unit.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of September 17, 2021, the date the Tenant returned vacant
possession to the Landlord.
