Tenants



 
 
Jose Ruiz and Ruth Ruiz (the
'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Carol Pregent and James Castilloux (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022.
Only one of the Landlords, Ruth Ruiz, attended the
hearing. The Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay
for the period from August
1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 10, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlord waives the application filing fee.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
10, 2021, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: SOL-25072-21
 
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $3,241.12*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 10, 2021.
 
3.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
