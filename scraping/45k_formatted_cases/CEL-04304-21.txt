Ocf C/o Bayshore
Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Shawn Vanata
and Sharon Vanata (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on November 15, 2021 with respect to application CEL-01947-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Board issued a consent
order pertaining to file
number CEL-01947-21 on November 15, 2021 which required the Tenants to
make regularly scheduled payments to the Landlord that were to be applied
against outstanding rental arrears. The
agreement also required the Tenants to continue making payments of lawful rent
for each consecutive month in full, and on time for each corresponding month beginning on December 1, 2021
through to January 1, 2023.
 
2.    
The agreement provided
that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain conditions specified in the order.
 
3.    
Pursuant to subsection
78(2) of the Act, an application made under section 78 requires the Landlord to
include with the application an affidavit setting out the conditions of the
settlement or order that had not been met and, how they had not been met. Section 78(4) of the Act also outlines the
information to be captured in the affidavit in circumstances when a Landlord
requests an order for payment, as has been the case in the subject application.

The content
of the declaration does not contain
the statutorily required
information.

1.    The Landlord's application under section
78 of the Act is dismissed.
