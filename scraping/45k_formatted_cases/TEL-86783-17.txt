C-C.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict L.C., G.F.
and A.B.W. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 12, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, M.Y.,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
THE APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 10, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending February 28, 2018, total $16,500.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1,
2016 to December 10, 2017 in the amount of $36.62.
THE
APPLICATION FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
6.      The
Tenants have substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right,
privilege or interest. 
7.      The
Tenants were given a first notice of termination under section 64 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The termination date was
December 16, 2017, which meets the 20 day notice requirements. The Landlord led
evidence to confirm that the Tenants failed to correct their behaviour during
the 7-day voiding period and they did not void the notice. 
8.      Based on
the uncontested evidence before the Board, we are satisfied that the Tenants
have substantially interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right privilege or
interest. The tenancy is terminated for the reasons that follow. 
9.       At the
hearing, the Landlord provided a copy of the lease agreement signed by the
Tenants and Landlord along with copies of outstanding utility bills for March
and July 2017. The Landlord also provided copies of emails confirming that the
LL had tried to engage the Tenants in an effort to resolve the outstanding
amounts owing. All documents were entered as exhibits at the hearing. 
10.   The
Landlord testified that he had to pay all fo the Tenants’ outstanding utility
bills in order to preserve his name and his property secured. He has suffered
financial impairment as a result of the Tenants’ failure to comply with the
terms of the lease and tenancy. 
11.   The
Landlord requested termination of the tenancy in a non-voidable order. 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 24, 2018.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $13,088.12*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 13, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 14, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 24, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 25, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 24, 2018, then starting February
25, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 25,
2018.
