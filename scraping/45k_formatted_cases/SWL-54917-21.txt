Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54917-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


106, 370 ADMIRAL DRIVE LONDON ON N5V3C2


 




Between:


Admiral Gardens


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Benjamin Keutsch
  James Keutsch


Tenants



 
 
 
Admiral Gardens (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Benjamin Keutsch and James Keutsch (the
'Tenants') The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard via video conference on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord’s representative, Kasandra Jang attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were served on August 12, 2021 with a
notice of entry for pest control treatment which was scheduled on August 17, 2021. The Tenants denied
entry to their rental unit on the day stipulated in
the notice of entry.
 
2.    
The Landlord served the first N5 notice to end your tenancy for interfering with others,
damage or overcrowding to the Tenants on August 18, 2021 because the Tenants’
conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s or other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex by failing to maintain
the rental unit and treat the
rental unit for pests.
 
3.     The Landlord served a second notice of entry on
September 7, 2021 for pest control treatment
which was scheduled on September 10, 2021. The Tenants left a cat in the rental unit despite the notice stating
that pets were to be removed from the rental unit therefore, the unit was not
able to receive pest control treatment.
 
4.     The second N5 notice to end your tenancy for interfering with others, damage
or overcrowding was served to the Tenants on September 14, 2021.

5.    
The Landlord has received
reports of cockroaches in the residential units and has been
unable to treat the rental unit for pests due to the Tenants’ denied entry.
 
6.     The Landlord is seeking termination of the Tenants’
tenancy.
 
7.    
Based on the uncontested evidence and on a balance
of probabilities, I find the Tenants
have substantially interfered with the Landlord
and other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit.
 
8.    
The Landlord is seeking
a termination of tenancy but I find that a conditional order would
be reasonable in the circumstances.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with section 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to subsection 83(1) (a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
a)  The Tenants shall prepare the rental unit in advance
of any pest control treatment in accordance with the written
instructions received with the notice of
entry;
 
b)  The Tenants shall also clean
the rental unit in preparation of any pest control
treatment and maintain the rental unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness;
 
c)  the Tenants shall allow access
to the rental unit with lawful notice
 
2.     If the Tenants
fail to comply
with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 above,
then, within 30 days of the breach,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make application within
30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1 of this order.
