File Number: TEL-18201-21
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 1245 SOMERVILLE STREET OSHAWA ON L1G4L1


 




Between:


Olga Trofimov Vasani Trofimov


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Kelven B Jones


Tenant



 
Olga Trofimov and Vasani
Trofimov (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy
and evict Kelven B Jones (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
The Landlords also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
19, 2021.
Only the Landlords, the Landlord's Legal
Representative Carrie Aylwin attended
the hearing.
As of 10:53 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On July 16, 2021, the Landlord gave the Tenant an N8
Notice of Termination with a termination date of September 30, 2021 alleging
that the Tenant
has been persistently late with rent payments to
the Landlord.
 
2.     This notice was issued pursuant
to paragraph 58(1)(a)
of the Act which says:
58 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following grounds:
1.  The tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes
due and payable.
 
3.     The month lawful
rent is currently $1,376.85 and rent is due on the 1st day of the month.
 
4.     The Landlord’s Representative submitted an updated
rent payment ledger documenting
that the Tenant pays the monthly rent marginally late but in full.
 
5.    
The Landlord's Legal Representative confirmed that rent is currently
up-to date except the Landlord’s filing fee charge.

6.    
Based on the testimony and
submissions made by both the Landlord's Legal Representative, while I find the
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent to the Landlord on the date it was due, in my opinion
the Tenant’s payment
history does not warrant termination of the tenancy.
7.    
After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the rent payment
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
8.     The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered:
 
1.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord the lawful monthly
rent for the rental unit,
currently
$1,376.85 in full and on
time, on or before the 1st day of
each month for the next 12- month period commencing March 1, 2022 through
to and including February 1, 2023.
2.    
If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in paragraph 1 above,
in full and on time, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenants
for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make
this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to make a
payment.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord, the $186.00* the Landlord’s filing fee on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing by February 15, 2022, the Landlord shall have the right, at any time, to collect from the Tenant the full amount
owing or any balance outstanding under this order.
