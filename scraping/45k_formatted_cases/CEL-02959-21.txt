Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02959-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 86 JAMES
ST
PARRY SOUND ON P2A1T9


 




Between:


Corey Mckee
  Brigitte Reda


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Paul Royal


Tenant



 
 
 
Corey Mckee and Brigitte
Reda (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paul Royal (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord requires possession
of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 27, 2022.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant was represented by his
paralegal Kelly Draycott.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords served a Notice of Termination (the
‘N12’) on September 22, 2021. The N12 alleges the Landlords required
the unit for their own use. The N12 set a termination date for November 30, 2021.
For the reasons set out below I find the N12 to be invalid, therefore, the
Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
2.    
Section 43(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') sets out the minimum requirements for a notice
of termination of a tenancy. Paragraph 43(1)(a) the Act provides
that a notice of termination shall identify the rental unit for which the
notice is given.
 
3.     I find, the N12 does not identify
the rental unit for which the notice is given,
because it does not identify the
municipality where the rental unit is located in.
 
4.    
Furthermore, the Landlord not complied with section 55(1)
of the Act which dictates that compensation, equivalent to one month’s rent, must be paid to the Tenant
no later than the termination dated specified in the N12 notice of termination
of the
tenancy given by the Landlord undersection 48.
