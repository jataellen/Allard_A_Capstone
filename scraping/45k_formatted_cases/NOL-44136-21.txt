Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44136-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


411, 1525 PARIS
STREET SUDBURY ON P3E5K2


 




Between:


Jack &
  Maija Ceming


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Sandra
Wyman


Tenant



 
 
 
Jack & Maija
Ceming (the 'Landlords) applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sandra Wyman (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords or another
tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021#
on January 10, 2022. The Landlords
represented by Al Dharsee attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlords
describe the Tenant
as a severe hoarder. The Landlord have attempted
to work with the Tenant to clean up the rental unit so pest control measures
can successfully be administered. Neighbouring
tenants are experiencing increased pest control problems which cannot be
resolved.
 
2.    
The Landlords have
hired a company known as Organize Your Space to assist the Tenant in remediating the problem. They began to work with the Tenant
in October but after the work began to remove items
and clean the unit the Tenant began to cancel appointments.
 
3.    
As a result, reports
from the Landlords’ pest control company
show that pest measures
will not be successful due to the issues in the Tenants rental unit.
 
4.    
Reports from Greater Sudbury
Fire Services show that the Tenant’s unit is a fire hazard due to the extensive amount of
combustibles.
 
5.    
I find this conduct
has substantially interfered the other tenants'
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and with the
Landlords’ lawful right, privilege or interest.




File Number: NOL-44136-21
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
24, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
