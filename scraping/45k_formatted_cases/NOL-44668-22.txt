Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44668-22
 



In the matter
of:


32,
  190 POLLOCK AVE KIRLAND LAKE ON P2N3R2


 




Between:


DTSSAB


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Bobby Tennant


Tenant



 
 
On December 30, 2021,
DTSSAB (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Bobby Tennant (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay
the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on February 11, 2021 with respect to application NOL-40534-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant
failed to pay to the Landlord $563.00
on or before December 1, 2021 towards rent.
 
The Tenant
also failed to pay to the Landlord
$100.00 on or before December
10, 2021 towards arrears of rent.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$2,875.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order NOL-40534-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $819.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
NOL-40534-20 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Order NOL-40534-20 is cancelled.

2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,382.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing up to December 31, 2021 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $18.51
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.

The tenant has until January
29, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 29, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
