  matter of:


1504, 720 BRUCE
AVENUE SUDBURY ON P3C5C4


 




Between:


Greater Sudbury Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Trevor Montpellier


Tenant



 
 
 
Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Trevor Montpellier (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on February 7, 2022.
Only the Tenant’s representative Rebecca
Osmond attended the hearing. The hearing commenced at 2:30pm and the Tenant had not called in throughout the day.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Photographs and submissions from the Landlord’s
representative show that the
Tenant’s entry door was damaged and the Tenant
attempted make a temporary repair
with a stick.
 
2.     The Tenant’s unit is extremely cluttered and dirty. The Landlord
has been attempting to have pest controls treatments but the Tenant refuses to
cooperate. There garbage throughout
the unit and tiles are missing from the bathroom floor.
 
3.     The Landlord has made multiple
entries to determine
if there has been any improvement,
but the Landlord is of the opinion that the Tenant has a complete disregard for
the property.
 
4.     I find the Tenant or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue
damage to the rental unit.
 
5.     The Landlord has incurred costs
of $400.00 to repair the damage.




 
 
 
6.     I find the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $400.00,
which represents the reasonable costs of
repairing the damage.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
