Centurion Property Associates Inc

of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.

the rental unit on November
10, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent was $1,710.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made payments
to the Landlord in the amount of $1,742.49 since the
application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $60.00 for administration charges related to cheques
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,710.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
