  matter of:

Between:


Thomas Bertrand Deborah Bertrand


Tenants




 


 
and


 




 


John Tha


Landlord



 
 
 
Thomas Bertrand
and Deborah Bertrand
(the 'Tenants') applied
for an order determining that John Tha (the 'Landlord') has
collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 5, 2021.
The Tenants and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
filed a T1 application on February 24, 2020 alleging
that the Landlord
did not return the last month rent deposit at the end of the tenancy.
 
2.    
It was uncontested that the Landlord
collected a last month rent deposit of $3,000.00 plus a utilities deposit of $400.00, and
that the Landlord did not return these funds.
 
3.    
The Landlord
also failed to pay the Tenants interest
on last month's deposit as required
by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
4.    
The Landlord
also collected a utilities deposit
which is an illegal charge
under the Act.
 
5.    
The Landlord stated
that he retained the funds as the Tenants had not provided 60 days notice of
intent to vacate. The Landlord may
bring a claim for this; however a Landlord may
not use this as a defence to withholding funds.
The Landlord may not raise
issues of their own on a
Tenant application.
 
6.    
The Landlord
retained the Tenants'
last month's rent deposit. This is prohibited by the Act.
 
7.    
The Landlord
collected rent in excess of the amount
allowed by the Act.

not pay the Tenants the full amount owing by January 16, 2021, the Landlord will owe interest.

calculated from January

the full amount
