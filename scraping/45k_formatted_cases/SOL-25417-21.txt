and


 




 


Christina Vanyken
  Jeff McCready


Tenants



 
 
Aaron Humphreys (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeff McCready and Christina Vanyken
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
As of 2:14 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on November
6, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,650.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,650.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 1, 2017 to October 16, 2021.




File Number: SOL-25417-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
6, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,559.10*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
6, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
