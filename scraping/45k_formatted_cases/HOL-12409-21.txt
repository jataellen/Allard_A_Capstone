Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12409-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


55, 380 LAKE STREET GRIMSBY ON L3M 0E8


 




Between:


Michael Marchionda


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Tamara McCulloch


Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Marchionda (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tamara McCulloch (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on February 1, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Paul Startek attended
the hearing. As of 2:24 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,100.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.     There is no last month’s
rent deposit.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 8, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$10,217.95*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 25, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 26, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 8, 2022, then starting
March 9, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$10,686.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$12,786.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 8, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after
March 9, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
