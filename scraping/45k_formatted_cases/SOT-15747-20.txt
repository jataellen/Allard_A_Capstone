In the matter
of:


117 HADDON AVENUE
S HAMILTON ON L8S1X7


 




Between:


Haolong Shen


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Hongyi
Wang


Landlord



 
Haolong Shen
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Hongyi Wang (the
'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the rental unit or residential complex
by the Tenant or by a member
of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on September 22, 2021.
 
The Tenant
and the Landlord
attended the hearing.
The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The rental
unit is room rented by the Tenant
in a rooming house that the Tenant shared
common facilities with other Tenants.
 
2.    
The tenancy
began on September 1, 2018; the tenancy was to run for a fixed term of two years; the monthly rent was $590.00
including parking as well as and a percentage amount towards utilities and
internet services.
 
3.    
The Tenant paid $1390.00
to the Landlord referred to as a first and last month rent
deposit plus a $50.00 key deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant moved out of
the rental unit on March 14, 2020 as a result of the issues set out in the Tenants’
application, in particular because of the COVID pandemic
risk and that the Tenant was required to share
facilities with ‘10’ other people in the rooming house complex.
 
5.    
The Tenant provided a
copy of the tenancy agreement, and despite that the tenancy between the Tenant and the Landlord
commenced September 2018, the Tenant was not provided a copy of a written
residential tenancy agreement on the LTB prescribed standard lease form.




 
6.    
Because the tenancy agreement was entered into after April 30, 2018, Section 12.1(1) of the Act requires that every tenancy agreement
entered into in respect of a prescribed class
of tenancies, on or after
that date, must comply with certain requirements, including the requirement that the tenancy agreement be in the
form prescribed pursuant to the Act.
 
7.    
In the T2 application,
the Tenants allege that the Landlord rejected the Tenant’s offer to end the tenancy earlier
and did provide
a rent abatement or return
the $50.00 key deposit
paid to the Landlord.
 
8.    
Sub-section 37(1)
of The Residential Tenancies
Act 2006 states: “A tenancy
may be terminated only in
accordance with this Act”.
 
9.    
Section 47 of The Residential Tenancies Act 2006 states: “A tenant
may terminate a tenancy at the end of a period of the tenancy
or at the end of the term of a tenancy for a
fixed term by giving notice of termination to the
landlord in accordance with section 44.”
 
10.  Sub-section 44(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act
2006 states in part: “ A notice under section 47 to terminate a monthly tenancy
shall be given at least 60 days before the date
the termination is specified (in the fixed term agreement) to be
effective and that date shall be on the last day of a rental period.
 
11.  The Tenant did not serve the Landlords with
a notice of termination setting out a specific termination date for the rental unit, therefore, without
providing the Landlord with 60 days advance
notice, the Tenant is in breach of sub-section 44(2) of the Act.
 
12.  Section 88 says that where a tenant
vacates without giving
a valid notice
of termination,
the tenant’s
liability for the rent ends on the earliest date the tenant could have given valid notice for, or when a new tenant
moves in, subject to the landlord’s duty to mitigate.
 
13.  In this instance,
the tenancy agreement
is based on a fixed
term rental period
that ends August 30, 2020.
 
14.  Without being given a valid notice to terminate the fixed term rental period,
the Landlord would not have
been effectively able to mitigate.
 
15.  I find the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
March 14, 2020 without notice to the Landlord
and without a binding agreement to terminate the tenancy having been entered
with the Landlord.
 
16.  I find that the Landlord
by enforcing his rights under the Act has not harassed the Tenant
and/or substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant.
 
17.  As such, there was no authority to determine whether
the tenancy ought to be terminated
by order of the Board based on alleged misconduct by the Landlords.




 
18.  In turn, where a tenant
vacates without notice
or with less than the notice required
by law, section 88 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 entitles the landlord to daily compensation in
lieu of the notice of termination the tenant ought to have given before leaving.
 
19.  The Tenant’s claim for return
of money paid to the Landlord are the basis of a T1
application, and no determination is made on that claim.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Tenant’s
application is dismissed.
