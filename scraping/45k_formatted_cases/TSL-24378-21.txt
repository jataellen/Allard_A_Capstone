In the matter
of:      6, 1 BIRCHLEA AVENUE

Justin Moule Tanya Powell


Tenants




 
On September 23, 2021,
Millburne Investments (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Justin Moule and
Tanya Powell (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the consent order issued by the Board on July
14, 2021 with respect to L1 application TSL-20192-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without
notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$651.71 on or before September
20, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. This was a breach of paragraph 2 of the consent order.
This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants consented to and were
ordered to pay $4,504.71 for rent arrears in the previous consent
order TSL-20192-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is
$651.71 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous consent order
TSL-20192-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
On September 29, 2011 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $775.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.




 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenants for the period from the date of collection, September 29,
2011 to December 31, 2020. There was no guideline rent increase allowed
(and consequently no interest on deposit) for 2021 due to COVID19.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
TSL-20192-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenants made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those
amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.
 
4.       
As of the date of this order, the
Tenants owe no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears of rent up to September 30, 2021 by $258.76.
 
5.       
The Tenants owe daily compensation
for every day they use the rental unit starting October 1, 2021 until they
actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted. The daily compensation rate is $26.93
per day. The Landlord is authorized to offset the daily rate of
$26.93 from the credit
of $258.76 owing to the Tenants, until the credit is used up.
 
6.       
Since it is unknown
at the time of issuing
this order when the Tenants
will move out or get evicted, the Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
 
January 4, 2022

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 16, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
