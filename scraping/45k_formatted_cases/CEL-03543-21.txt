Isaiah Crawley (williams) Kaitlyn Fulton


Tenants



 
 
 
Susan Holmes (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kaitlyn Fulton and
Isaiah Crawley (williams) (the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants
to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Chris Holmes attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s representative
submits the Tenants have vacated the rental unit. The Landlord applied for $2,000.00 compensation due to damage the Tenants did to a door. The Landlord has incurred costs of $542.00 to repair
the door.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $542.00
for the cost the Landlord
has incurred to repair the door.
 
3.     The Landlord has the right
to collect the full amount
at any time.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the full amount owing
by February 25, 2022 the Tenant will owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated at 2% annually on the outstanding balance.
