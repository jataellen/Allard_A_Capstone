Between:

Landlords




 


and


 




 


Patricia Aho
  Terry Aho


Tenants



 
Adam Horton (AH) and Marilyn Horton (MH) (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Terry Aho (TA) and Patricia Aho (PA) (the
'Tenants') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on December
13, 2021.
 
The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative Joseph
Kennedy, the Tenants
and the Tenant's Legal Representative
Mariusz Przybylowski attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.     On August 6, 2021 the Landlord served
the Tenants a (N12) Notice
to End the Tenancy setting
out that the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by the Landlord.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice
was October 19, 2021.
5.    
The Tenants did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.




 
6.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of the
Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
7.    
The Landlord stated that the compensation was paid to the Tenants
by personal cheque payable to the Tenants dated July
19, 2021 and was tendered August 30, 2021.
 
8.     The Landlord (AH) has filed a declaration affirming his good faith intention to take possession
of the rental unit for his own personal use for a minimum of
one year.
 
9.     The Landlord
is requesting a standard order
to terminate the
tenancy.
 
10.  The Tenant's Legal Representative requested the Landlord’s application be dismissed based on
Relief from Eviction Interpretation Guideline 7 of the LTB, that states, even
though a landlord proves their case in an application to evict a tenant, the Board must review and consider the
circumstances of each case to determine whether or not the eviction should be
refused or delayed.
 
11.  Interpretation Guideline
7 of the LTB
Section 83, subsection (1) states, the Board shall refuse to grant the application where satisfied
that:
a)   
the landlord is in serious
breach of the landlord's responsibilities under this Act or of any
material covenant in the tenancy agreement:
b)   
the reason for the application being brought is that the tenant
has complained to a government authority of the landlord's violation of a law dealing
with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards:
c)   
the reason for the application being brought is that the tenant has attempted to secure or enforce his or her legal rights:




 
12.  The Tenant's Legal Representative
referred to T2 application HOT-11247-21 filed with the Board by
the Tenants on July 6, 2021
 
13.  The Landlord's Legal Representative acknowledged that
the Tenants have filed a T2 application that has yet to be heard, however the allegations plead in that T2 application are not the purported
maintenance issues that should have been be raised through a T6 application.
 
14.  I reviewed the T2 application in that the Tenants
claim substantial interference of their reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit
and that the Landlords harassed the Tenants. The remedies sought in that application
were a rent abatement and for
the Landlords to stop certain
behaviour. The pleadings were generalized and provided no specific details such as dates, times and any
measurable impact.
 
15.  A party making
an allegation in an application has the onus of proving
those allegations on a
balance of probabilities.
 
16.  The standard of proof requires the party to show with evidence that,
“more likely than not”, their assertions are true and that evidence
“must be sufficiently clear, convincing
and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.”
 
17.  Here, in my view, the Tenant has not met the required
standard by simply referring to Interpretation Guideline 7 of the LTB.
 
18.  All in All, I was satisfied the technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act were met.
 
19.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
20.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $715.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. The deposit shall be applied
to the last month of the tenancy.
 
21.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.




 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
