Metcap Living Management Inc (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Hanane
Hadda (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tricia Radam, attended the hearing. As of 10:13 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 7, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,787.47.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,784.32 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 7, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the
application was filed.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $32,225.52*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 7, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
