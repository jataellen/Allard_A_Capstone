  at Toronto: December 17, 2018




f.l. myers J.  (Orally)
[1]              
On July 13, 2018, the Landlord and Tenant Board approved and issued an
eviction order against the tenant for non-payment of rent. The tenant did not
appear to contest the proceeding.
[2]              
The Board’s order granted the tenant until July 24, 2018 to void the
eviction by paying rent by that time.
[3]              
The tenant claimed that she did void the order on time. However, the
cheque that she gave to the landlord had an error that made it uncashable. 
[4]              
The Board found at a subsequent hearing that even if the cheque was
submitted on time (and there was contested evidence on that fact), the fact
that the cheque had an error that made it uncashable meant that payment had not
been received within the time required so that the order of the Board had not
been properly voided.
[5]              
Moreover, because the tenant had used this process once before, she was
not entitled under the provisions of the statute to seek a discretionary relief
from forfeiture upon making a payment late.
[6]              
The tenant then filed a notice of appeal to this court. She has not paid
rent since filing her notice of appeal in October of this year. November and
December rent are due in the amount of $1,033.00 for each month and are now in
arrears.
[7]              
The tenant advises the she is being investigated by healthcare
professionals for illness. She says she needs an invasive diagnostic procedure that
was originally scheduled for tomorrow. However, the procedure will be scheduled
for a date in January.
[8]              
The tenant advises that her request to adjourn this proceeding is on the
basis that her health concerns have prevented her from properly preparing for
today’s motion. 
[9]              
There is no admissible evidence from the tenant submitted for this
hearing. However, to provide assistance to a self-represented party, the court
had the registrar’s office send a message to the parties last week that if the
tenant was seeking an adjournment she should try to provide an admissible
affidavit from a doctor or healthcare professional detailing her health
concerns. 
[10]          
Rather than doing so, the tenant handed-up a note from an administrator
of a clinic that simply says that there will be a diagnostic procedure
scheduled. There is no evidence at all that the tenant’s health has been
affected or that it has been so affected for a such a length of time to have
prevented her from taking steps to perfect her appeal or to pay rent or to
prepare for today’s motion.
[11]          
The landlord argues that the appeal should be dismissed for delay
because the tenant has, among other things, not ordered a transcript that she
says she requires for the hearing of the appeal. That was to have been done
within 30 days of filing her notice of appeal. 
[12]          
The landlord also argues for a dismissal because the appeal is devoid of
merit. Under s. 210 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, an
appeal only lies to the Divisional Court on a question of law. The landlord
argues that the tenant has not raised a question of law in this proceeding.
[13]          
The landlord also argues that this appeal is an abuse of process. It
notes that by advancing an appeal with no particularized grounds, not
perfecting the appeal on a timely basis, and not paying rent, the court should
draw the inference that the appellant is “gaming” the system and the appeal is being
used for delay as a result of the automatic stay that applies as soon as an
appeal is filed.
[14]          
The tenant has indicated that she is willing to pay rent pending the
hearing of her appeal. She offers to pay arrears and January rent in three
instalments. The first instalment would be for $400 on December 27 or 28 of
this year. She then offers to pay $1,500 on each of January 10 and 24 of next
year. There is no indication of how the tenant would be able to arrange those
payments given her allegations concerning her health and her need for medical
tests in January or why she would be able to make those payments then but not
today.
[15]          
The tenant was also unable to commit to dates by which she would order
the transcripts.
[16]          
As to her issue of law, the tenant advises that she will argue that the Landlord
and Tenant Board erred in finding her uncashable cheque to be insufficient
payment to void the eviction order. As counsel for the landlord submits, that
matter does not raise a question of law. It is a question of fact or at best a
question of mixed fact and law. Accordingly, this court has no jurisdiction to
deal with that submission.
[17]          
In my view, even if the tenant makes the payments of the instalments
that she is offering, she is just delaying the inevitable because there are no
valid grounds advanced for an appeal of the Landlord and Tenant Board’s
decision. It is therefore not in the interests of justice to extend this matter
any further or to adjourn the matter today.
[18]          
The tenant is not asking for time to put in more or further evidence or
different evidence. The facts rather are not in dispute.
[19]          
The tenant’s back-end loaded offers to pay rent in instalments are also
not credible and appear to me to be a furtherance of a stalling intention.
[20]          
In my view, (1) there in no valid ground of appeal on a question of law
particularized in the notice of appeal or particularized orally by the tenant
today; (2) the failure to perfect or at least order transcripts on a timely
basis has not been adequately explained; and, (3) this appeal is in fact an
abuse of process to try to take advantage of the stay of proceedings.
[21]          
On these bases, the appeal must be quashed. 
[22]          
The landlord is entitled to its costs on a substantial indemnity basis
because of the tenant’s abuse of the process of this court for a collateral
purpose. The landlord seeks the sum of $4,473.14 for costs on a substantial
indemnity basis including today’s proceeding. 
[23]          
 I have reviewed the landlord’s costs outline and find the rates charged
and hours incurred more than reasonable. Accordingly, the tenant will be ordered
to pay costs of $4,473.14 all-in, forthwith. 
[24]          
In the exercise of the court’s discretion, in my view, the order of the Landlord
and Tenant Board should not be enforceable until January 14, 2019 and this term
should be contained in the order quashing the appeal.
[25]          
I have endorsed the Motion Record of the Landlord (Respondent) as follows:
“For oral reasons dictated in court today, order signed.”
