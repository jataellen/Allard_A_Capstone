Review Order
 
Jay Beswick (the
'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Steve Prendergast (the
'Landlord') failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with
health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was resolved by order TET-15693-21 issued on May 26, 2021.
 
On June 15, 2021 the Landlord
requested a review of the order
and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is
resolved.
 
On June 30, 2021 interim order
TET-15693-21 -IN was issued, staying
the order issued
on May 26, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on August 31, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
REQUEST TO
REVIEW
 
1.    
The Tenant’s request to
review alleges that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate at the
case management hearing held on May 17, 2021 because he did not receive the
notice of hearing by e-mail nor did he receive a hard copy in the mail. The
Tenant sent an email to the Board
and the Landlord
after the hearing
date once he had
discovered he missed it.
 
2.    
The Landlord
submitted that he did not dispute the Tenant’s request
and indicated that it
was possible the Tenant did not receive the email and was not notified of the
hearing date.




 
3.    
The Board’s
records show the notice of hearing was e-mailed to the Tenant
on March 24, 2021 at 7:45pm. There is not record of
whether a copy was mailed to the Tenant.
 
4.    
In King-Winton v. Doverhold Investments Ltd., 2008 CanLII
60708 (ON SCDC), the Courts found, at paragraph
7,
 
Being reasonably able to participate in the proceeding must be interpreted broadly, natural justice requires no less. The tenant has never delayed in pursuing
her remedies.
 
5.    
Based on the evidence
before the Board, I find that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate at the hearing
in May 2021 as he did not receive the notice of hearing nor is
there a record of it being mailed to the Tenant.
 
6.    
As such, the Tenant’s
request to review
was granted. I proceeded to hear the Tenant’s
T6 application.
 
T6 APPLICATION
 
Preliminary Issue
 
7.    
The Tenant
’s T6 application was filed on
March 9, 2021 pursuant to subsection 29(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 29(2) of
the Act states:
 
No application may be made under subsection (1) more than one year after the day
the alleged conduct giving rise to the application occurred.
 
8.    
The Landlord submitted
that the Tenant ’s application should be dismissed as the incidents outlined
in the application are beyond
the one-year limitation period contained in section 29(2).
 
9.    
The Tenant submitted
that he did not want to create a hostile relationship with his Landlord, so he
delayed the filing of the application but agreed that it was out of time.
Furthermore, the Tenant
indicated that he signed an agreement on September 2, 2020
agreeing there were no outstanding issues in the rental unit.
 
10.  The date the application was filed was
March 9, 2021, which means that it could only include incidents that occurred
on or after March 10, 2020. However, given the suspension to limitation periods
that occurred between March 16, 2020 and September 13, 2020 (pursuant to
Ontario Regulations 73/20 and 457/20 under the Reopening Ontario [A Flexible Response
to COVID-19] Act,
2020, S.O. 2020, c. 17) issues as far as September 9, 2019 could have been
considered if they were on the application.
 
11.  The application before me alleges that the
Landlord failed to maintain the driveway around the drainage system
that resulted in a flood in the Tenant’s unit. This occurred
in March 2019 and April 2019. I find that the specific incidents
outlined in the Tenant ’s application all occurred before September 9, 2019 and
are therefore out of time.
 
12.  In light of the above,
the Tenant ’s application must be dismissed.




 
13.  This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request
to review order TET-15693-21 issued
on May 26, 2021 is granted and replaced with the following order.
 
2.    
The interim
order issued on June 30, 2021 is cancelled.
 
3.    
The Tenant’s
application is dismissed.
