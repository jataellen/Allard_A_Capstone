Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Arlene Chalker


Tenant



 
 
 
23 Lynnwood Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Arlene Chalker (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on August 3, 2021 with respect to application
SOL-19371-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January 1, 2022
to January 31, 2022.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $681.25 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2008 to February 2, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-19371-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26842-22
 
3.    
As of the date of this order, the
Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$648.76.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$26.68 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.

the Board will schedule a hearing.
