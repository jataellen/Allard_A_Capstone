Review Order
 
 
L S (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict S D (the 'Tenant') The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
application: TSL-04253-19)
 
S D (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining
that C Aka "G" H C/o S-K A, L S and S-K A
(the 'Landlords') or the Landlords' superintendent or the Landlords' agent harassed,
obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant, entered the rental
unit illegally, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's
household and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of
a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlords are obligated to
supply under the tenancy agreement. (T2 application: TST-02626-19)
 
These applications were resolved by order TSL-04253-19/TST-02626-19
issued on November 25, 2019.
 
On December 3, 2019, the Tenant
requested a review of the order.
 
A preliminary review of the review
request was completed without a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s request for a
review is based on the ground of serious error.
L2 application for persistent late payment
2.     
The Tenant’s rent is due on
the first day of each month. 
 
3.     
In the order under review,
the Member determined that the Tenant had made her rent payments to the
Landlord persistently late. The Member made this determination after noting
that it was uncontested that the rent payments for December 2018, January 2019
and February 2019 were paid late. The Member also noted that the Board issued
order TSL-95336-18 which made a finding that the Tenant was in arrears of rent
for April 2018 and May 2018 as of May 28, 2018. The Member also found that the
Tenant paid rent late for other months in 2018 and 2019 but for the purposes of
this review request, it is not necessary to consider these other findings.
 
4.     
Order TSL-95336-18, issued
on May 31, 2018 finds the Tenant was in arrears of two months of rent, for the
period from April 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018, as of May 28, 2018. This is
essentially a finding that by May 28, 2018 the Tenant had not paid rent for either
April 2018 or May 2018 and so it was reasonable to conclude that the Tenant
paid her rent late for these two months. 
 
5.     
In her voluminous
submissions to the Board the Tenant gave no evidence or submissions that
contradict the finding that it is uncontested that the Tenant paid rent after
the first day of the month in the months of December 2018, January 2019 and
February 2019. 
 
6.     
The Tenant submitted that
there is a “rule” that a landlord may not unilaterally change the method of
payment of rent and that the Member failed to regard this “rule”. There is no
such rule in the Board’s Rules of Procedure, the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the ‘Act’), or the regulations under the Act. It is uncontested that
in July 2018 the Landlord’s staff told the Tenant that they would no longer
pick up the rent from the Tenant. In her written submissions for the hearing
giving rise to the review and in her review submissions the Tenant stated that
there were several occasions upon which the Landlord’s staff failed to pick up
the rent on the first day of the month, including after July 2018. In the order
the Member notes that the Tenant could have made rent payments by mail before
the first of each month to ensure payment on time, but the Tenant did not do
so. The Tenant is obligated to pay the rent on or before the first day of each
month. She did not do so for at least five months in a twelve month period,
even though it was possible to ensure prompt payment by paying rent by a method
other than waiting for the Landlord’s staff to pick it up (by mailing cheques,
for example). 
 
7.     
Based on the above, I find
that the Member’s determination that the Tenant paid her rent persistently late
was reasonable and was supported by the evidence before her and the submissions
of the parties.
 
8.     
The Tenant raised a number
of issues in her review request that are irrelevant to whether there was a
serious error in the order or the proceedings. For example, she submitted that
there are problems with the condition of the building. I did not consider any
of the submissions that are irrelevant.
 
9.     
In her request for a review,
the Tenant submitted that the Member erred in failing to consider mandatory
refusal of eviction, under subs.83(3) of the Act, due to the application being
brought because the Tenant has attempted to secure or enforce her legal rights.
However, this issue was not raised in any meaningful way at the hearing. At the
hearing in person on May 23, 2019 the Tenant stated that the Landlord was in
serious breach of the rental agreement and the Act and that the Landlord filed
this application as retaliation tor the Tenant seeking to secure her rights.
However, the Tenant gave no evidence or any further submissions to support
these statements and so the Member could not reasonably deny eviction pursuant
to subs. 83(3) of the Act. Accordingly, that she did not do so is not a serious
error. 
 
10.  
The Member’s decision not to
grant relief under subs. 83(1) of the Act was a discretionary one. A Member’s
exercise of discretion should not be interfered with lightly. In this case, the
Tenant has provided no reasons that could support a conclusion that the Member
exercised her discretion unreasonably. I therefore cannot find that the Member
erred in the exercise of her discretion under subs. 83(1) of the Act.
T2 application
11.  
Interim Order TSL-04253-19-IN3/TST-02626-19-IN3, issued on November 1, 2019 gave the Tenant a deadline to pay her
outstanding Board costs otherwise her application would be discontinued. The
Tenant did not pay the outstanding Board costs by the deadline and her T2
application was discontinued.
 
12.  
The Tenant filed a request
to review Interim Order TSL-04253-19-IN3/TST-02626-19-IN3,
before the final order for this matter was issued and that request was denied.
As the merits of the Interim order were already adjudicated by the Board in
that previous review, this order
will not address the merits of the Interim Order.
 
13.  
The Tenant submitted that it
is unfair that the Landlord could breach Board orders without consequence but
when the Tenant failed to pay Board costs her application was discontinued. This
is not unfair. If the Landlord had failed to pay Board costs that had been ordered,
the Landlord would face the same consequences as are faced by the Tenant for
failing to pay Board costs that had been ordered.
 
14.  
The Tenant mentioned in her
submissions that she has filed an appeal of the order denying her review of
Interim Order TSL-04253-19-IN3/TST-02626-19-IN3. That
she has done so is not relevant to the review request of the final order. If
she did file an appeal, she did so after the final order was issued and so if
there is a stay of the interim order imposed by the Tenant having served a
notice of appeal, that stay would have taken effect after the issuance of the
final order. In other words, when the final order was issued, there was no stay
in effect that would prohibit the Board from discontinuing the Tenant’s
application.
Disposition
15.  
On the basis of the
submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
It is ordered that:
 
The request to review order TSL-04253-19/ TST-02626-19 issued on November
25, 2019 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
