Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-89487-18
 











 
 
 

C. C. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict D. K. and S.  P. (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.  This is an L1
application.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they have been persistently late in
paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.  This is an L2
application.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 23,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, S. H., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.    
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective March 2, 2018.
2.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,073.74 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 2, 2018.
4.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
5.     
I am satisfied the Tenants
have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due based on the
following evidence.
6.    
The Landlord submitted a
list dates when the Landlord served notices of termination on the Tenants beginning
December 2016 for a total of six notices.
7.    
The Landlord also submitted
a list of the following applications to the Board for this tenancy:
TEL-20273-11; TEL-32954-13; TEL-63233-15; TEL-71591-16; TEL-84109-17; and
TEL-81319-17.
8.    
The lease signed September
5, 2005, states that rent is due on the first of each month.
9.    
Even after the Tenants were
served a notice of termination for persistently late payment of rent the
Tenants continued their behaviour and did not pay their rent on time.
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
11.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the
order for non-payment of rent as set out below, the tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before May 5, 2018.
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $1,938.11*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to April 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $35.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting April 25, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 5, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 6,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 5, 2018, then starting May 6, 2018, the Landlord may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 6, 2018.
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)       $3,411.06 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018, or
ii)      $4,484.80 if the payment is made on or before May 5, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 6, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
APPLICATION FOR PERSISTENTLY LATE PAYMENT
10.  If the Tenants void the non-payment of rent
portion of this order the following shall apply:
11.  
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated, as of May 31, 2018. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before May 31, 2018.
12.  
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
13.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after June 1, 2018.
