Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12018-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


3802, 180 UNIVERSITY AVENUE TORONTO ON M5H1K3


 




Between:


Loai
  Bugshan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Emmanuel De Guzman


Tenant



 
 
 
Loai Bugshan (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Emmanuel De Guzman (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by, Paul Mitassov, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.     The Landlord insisted
that the tenancy
be terminated.
 
3.    
The Tenant has been late paying rent and was previously in arrears. The Tenant testified that he was having difficulty
due to the pandemic, but has paid the Landlord everything he owes, is now paying rent on time, is
fully employed again as a project manager for an engineering firm, and can
afford to pay the rent in full and on time going forward.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act
with the conditions as set out below.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the lawful rent
in full and on time for each consecutive month commencing March 2022 and continuing through
February 2023.




File Number: HOL-12018-21
 
2.    
In the event the
Tenant fails to make the above said payment in full and on time, the Landlord
shall be entitled to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach
of this Order, without
notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
