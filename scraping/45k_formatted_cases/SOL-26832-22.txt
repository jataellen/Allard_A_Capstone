File Number: SOL-26832-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 16 WENTWORTH STREET S HAMILTON
  ON L8N2Y3


 




Between:


Blake Webb


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Debbie Colley
  Steve Colley


Tenants



 
 
 
Blake Webb (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Steve Colley
and Debbie Colley (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement
to terminate the tenancy.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022 at 9:25am.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Nilo Grabar. Also in attendance was the
Landlord’s witness, Trisha Florence.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s L3 application was filed pursuant
to subsection 77(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') with a termination date of March
31, 2022. This section
states:
 
77 (1) A landlord
may, without notice to the tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting
the tenant if,
 
43              
the landlord and tenant have entered into an agreement
to terminate
 
the tenancy; or
 
44              
the tenant has given the landlord
notice of termination of the tenancy. [Emphasis added.]




 
2.    
Normally, such applications are
followed by ex-parte orders as outlined by subsection 77(4) of the Act; however, this matter was directed to a hearing
as the N11 submitted with the application was only signed by one of the two named
Tenants in the application.
 
3.    
Section 43(1) of the Act states:
 
43  (1) Where this Act permits
a landlord or tenant to give a notice of termination, the notice shall be in a form approved by
the Board and shall,
 
(a)              
identify the rental unit for which the notice
is given;
 
(b)              
state the date on which the tenancy is to terminate; and
 
(c)              
be signed by the person
giving the notice,
or the person’s agent.
 
4.    
Thus, the N11 filed with the L3 application appeared to be defective as it was not signed by all the parties to the tenancy
agreement (meaning, the other party to the tenancy agreement).
 
5.    
At the hearing, however,
the Landlord submitted
a copy of the last page of the N11 agreement to terminate the tenancy
with the first-named Tenant’s signature, in the incorrect spot.
 
6.     The Landlord’s witness, Trisha Florence (TF), who
manages the rental unit for the Landlord, testified that she has been in regular communication with the Tenants
and that all parties agreed to
terminate the tenancy on March 31, 2022. After that, she prepared the N11 for
the Tenants to sign- which the second-named Tenant did and returned it to the
Landlord. When TF discovered that only one signature was on the N11, (after the
application had been directed to a hearing) she inquired with the second-named
Tenant who indicated that the first-named Tenant was in the hospital at the
time.
 
7.     Once the first-named Tenant was discharged from the
hospital, TF arranged for her to sign the N11 (which was submitted to the Board at the hearing, dated
February 4, 2022). TF testified that the Tenants were
not technologically-savvy, so she did her best to accommodate and assist the
Tenants during the signing process of the N11.
 
8.     She spoke to the Tenants about the hearing date and they indicated that they would not
be in attendance as they signed the N11 and did not intend to stay longer than
the agreed-upon date.
 
9.    
Based on the
uncontested evidence before the Board, I find therefore that there was a
meeting of the minds between
the Landlord and Tenants at the time the N11 agreement
to terminate the tenancy was signed, both on January 15, 2022 and February 4,
2022. While the first-named Tenant’s signature is in the wrong place,
I do not find this negates
the agreement to terminate the tenancy.




 
10. 
As this
application came before the Board for an oral hearing, I am required under
subsection 83(2) of the Act to consider
all of the circumstances of both parties
before granting an eviction order.
 
11. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction. Since the termination
date is March 31, 2022, an order shall issue accordingly.
 
12. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
