Galaxy Value Add Ontario Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephanie Kervin and Nicola Sark

This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sharon Harris, attended the hearing. As of 2:04 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.

paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
