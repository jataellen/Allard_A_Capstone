In the matter
of:


310, 38 NIAGARA STREET TORONTO ON M5V3X1


 




Between:


Ciara Minden


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Leonard Sedun


Landlord



 
 
 
Ciara Minden (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Leonard Sedun (the 'Landlord')
harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the Tenant,
entered the rental unit illegally, altered the locking system on a door giving entry to the rental
unit or residential complex
without giving the Tenant replacement keys and substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member
of the Tenant's household.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December
14, 2021.
 
The Tenant
attended the hearing
with her sister,
Saoirse Minden. The Landlord attended
with their representative Steven Smith, and the Property Manager
Charlene Holmes.
 
Background
 
1.   
This application was initially filed by the Tenant on July 10th, 2021 as a Request
for Urgent Hearing by the
Tenant because of an illegal lock change.
 
2.   
An interim
order was issued on July 22nd, 2021 granting the request, and the matter was
set for a hearing on August 31st, 2021.
 
3.    On that date, the
Landlord’s representative requested
an adjournment as the Landlord was ill and could not attend the hearing.
It was determined on that day that the Tenant had regained possession of the
unit and as such, the matter was no longer considered urgent and the matter was
adjourned. The Tenant is still in possession of the unit.
 
4.   
On May 6th, 2021,
the Tenant and the
Landlord through their brokers
negotiated a lease for the unit in
question, which is a one-bedroom condominium located 2 floors below the
Tenant’s previous unit, located at 38 Niagara Street in Toronto.
 
Professional Painting
and Cleaning




 
5.   
The Tenant alleges that the
Landlord substantially interfered with her tenancy by not professionally painting
and cleaning the unit prior to occupancy
as agreed to. The lease was entered by the Tenant as exhibit
#1. Page 5 of the lease included a clause that specified that the unit would be
professionally cleaned and painted before occupancy.
 
6.   
The Tenant testified that the Property
Manager advised her on
June 24th, 2021,
that the previous tenant
would be moving out the last day before the Tenant was to take possession of
the unit and that she intended on painting and cleaning the unit the day after,
which was July 1st, 2021.
 
7.    The Tenant had arranged for elevator moving
service for July 2nd, 2021 at 9:00 am.
 
8.    The Tenant had visited the unit on July 1st, 2021. She submitted 20 photos as exhibit
#2 which the Tenant submits shows that the unit was not painted or cleaned to her satisfaction. I note that
despite the apparent lack of cleanliness, the unit appears to be liveable and
there appears to be no apparent defect which would have prevented the tenant
from moving into the unit, despite the lack of cleaning and painting.
 
9.   
The Tenant testified that the Property
Manager had advised
her that one of the painters
had an emergency that prevented the finishing of the painting that day, and
that the painting would be completed the next day July 2nd, 2021. As a result of this information,
the Tenant cancelled her elevator service for the next day.
 
10. It is at this point
where communication between
the parties broke
down.
 
11. The Tenant testified that by July 2nd,
2021, neither the painting nor cleaning had been completed however the Property
Manager testified that she advised the Tenant that the work could have been completed
the morning of the 2nd, and that
she would assist with the Tenant’s move that same afternoon. The Tenant advised that she had cancelled her move for the 2nd, and that she could not
move in on the 3rd, as she
was working and would try to schedule
movers for the weekend.
 
12. On July 3rd, 2021, while moving some items into the unit, the
Tenant noticed that painting and cleaning had not been
completed and she had her broker send photos to the Landlord’s broker advising
that the unit was not in the Tenant’s opinion, move-in ready.
 
Again, I note here that the
unit was simply not painted or professionally cleaned. The unit was never in such a state of disrepair that the Tenant
could not have started moving more items into the unit as she
was in fact doing at the time.
 
13. Having not heard from the Property
Manager by July 5th, 2021, The Tenant
then contacted the Landlord
and Tenant Board, which she testified she was advised to schedule the cleaning
herself and then to seek a rent abatement for the cost. The Property Manager
testified that she does not check her e-mails on the weekend and would only be
checking for text messages for any property issues.




 
14. On July 6th, 2021, The Property Manager
finally read the Tenant’s e-mail advising her that the Tenant hired
professional cleaners to attend at the unit on July 7th, 2021. This
upset the Property Manager
and the Tenant testified
that she requested to enter the unit
that day however, the Property
Manager testified she wanted to see the unit the next day, July 7th,
2021, but received no response from
the Tenant. The cleaning was completed on July 7th,
2021 for a cost of $300.00.
 
15. On July 7th,
2021 The Tenant’s broker was
contacted by the Property Manager to advise that the lease would be rescinded and that the Tenant
would not be reimbursed for the cleaning. The Property Manager testified that
given the e-mails and text messages exchanged between the parties, the Tenant
was no longer interested in moving into the unit. The Property Manager
also testified that the cost of $300 for the cleaning exorbitant and that she would only pay
$150 to $170 for her own cleaners to complete the work.
 
Illegal Entry
& Lock Change
 
16. The Property Manager did testify that they she did
enter the unit sometime between July 7th and July 9th, 2021. She testified
that she observed
the unit to be empty and there to be some general dustiness but that everything else was fine. The Property Manager was not given explicit permission
to enter the unit, nor was the reason for entering the unit in compliance with
s. 27 of the Residential Tenancies Act (the “Act”) which prohibits a
Landlord from entering a rental
unit without providing a Tenant at least 24 hours notice,
or for a number of other reasons that are not pertinent to this
application.
 
17. The Tenant testified that on July 9th, 2021
while she attempted to move into the unit, she discovered that her keys did not
work and that the locks had been changed. She was never contacted by the Property Manager
about this. No rent or deposit had been returned to her and she was forced to
cancel her move for the next day. This action taken by the Property Manager is
a violation of s. 24 of the Act, which states:
 
s. 24 A landlord shall not alter the locking system
on a door giving entry to a rental unit or
residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement
keys.
 
18. The Property Manager testified that she changed
the locks as the unit was in
her opinion, unsecure and that the Tenant had not taken possession of
the unit. This testimony does not make
logical sense considering that the Property Manager
was aware that the Tenant had arranged for the unit to be
cleaned a mere two days prior. I do not accept this explanation for the
changing of the locks.
 
19. The Tenant contacted the Toronto Housing Unit, who in
turn contacted the Property Manager and arranged
for the new keys to be provided
to the Tenant on July 20th, 2021.
 
20. Based on the evidence provided by both the Tenant
and the Property manager, I find that
on a balance of probabilities that
the Property Manager as the
Landlord’s agent did enter the unit illegally and did also alter the locking
system of the door giving entry to the rental




 
unit without
giving the Tenant
replacement keys, which
substantially interfered with the
Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit
 
21. The Tenant then moved into the
unit on August
2nd, 2021.
 
Remedies:
 
Substantial Interference – July 1st, 2021 – July 8th, 2021
 
22.
I will deal first with the time period prior to the illegal
entry and lock change, that being from July 1st, 2021, to July 8th,
2021.
 
23. I find and agree with the Landlord’s legal representative’s submissions that despite the unit not being painted
and cleaned to the Tenant’s
standards, the unit in question was
never at any point not move-in
ready. In fact, I find the Tenant could have continued to move her items
into the unit by Jul 1st, 2021and could have still arranged for the
painting and cleaning to be completed at a later date due to the painter’s
emergency situation on July 1st, 2021.
 
24. I find that the Property
Managers solution to the delay by having the work completed
the next day was reasonable
in the circumstances however, the
communication breakdown between the parties led to animosity which fed into the
Property Manager’s subsequent bad decisions.
 
 
25. The Tenant is also seeking $300 for the price of Sunshine
Cleaners for the work conducted on July 7th, 2021. A receipt
was provided for this amount
however, I do not find
on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord substantially interfered with
the Tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the unit. The photos that were submitted
into evidence showed very little, if any mess. I further find that the Property
Manager did attempt to take reasonable steps
after the issue with the
painter prior to the Tenants occupation. As such, no remedy will be awarded.
 
Illegal Entry
& Lock-Change – July 9th, 2021 – July 20th, 2021
 
26. The Tenant is seeking a one month rent abatement of
$1795.00 for the month of July 2021. As already
indicated, the Tenant could have taken possession of the unit July 1st, 2021 however, she was
illegally locked out from July 9th, 2021 until July 20th,
2021. A prorated rent abatement for that date range in the amount of $694.84
will be awarded.
 
 
27. The Tenant further
seeks alternative rent costs
of $843.15 for rent at her old unit from July
1st to July 14th, 2021, and a further $1150 for splitting
rent with her sister for July 14th to July 31st, 2021. Having already awarded a rent
abatement for the period in which the Tenant was locked out of the unit, I find
there is no need to also award rent she was otherwise paying outside of that
timeline.




 
28. The Tenant provided
an invoice in evidence of moving supplies purchased in the amount of
$326.85 dated July 13th, 2021 with a pick-up date of July 20th, 2021. These were costs
that were directly related to the illegal lock change and I find are reasonable
in the circumstances.
 
29. The Tenant provided
an invoice in evidence
from Alluster for moving and storage fees in
the amount of $1863.36 dated July 14th, 2021 until July 30th, 2021. These expenses are within the dates in which the Tenant was locked of
the unit and are reasonable. The Tenant sought an additional $220.00 for a tip
however, this cost is not included in the invoice and will not be included.
 
30. The Tenant further requested $509.23 total for
delivery fees of items that had to be redirected as a result of the illegal lockout
however, I find that the Tenant could
have made alternative
arrangements for these services and this cost will not be awarded.
 
31. The Tenant provided
further invoices for her
electricity bill for her
new unit for the month of
July 2021 for $91.37 along with an invoice for insurance costs for the new unit
of $36.18. These costs will be prorated for the dates the Tenant was locked out of the unit for a
total of $35.37 for the hydro ($91.37/31 = $2.95/day x 12 days = $35.37) and
$13.69 for the insurance ($35.37/31 = $1.14/day
x 12
days = $13.69. She had requested
further costs for Wi-Fi
expenses and elevator fees however, she did not provide invoices for those
costs and they will not be awarded.
 
32. The Tenant sought $500 for food disposal. While I was
not provided specific invoices for this amount, I do find that these costs were
incurred because of being illegally locked of the unit from July 9th, 2021 to July 20th, 2021. For
this loss, I will aware the Tenant
$177.42 equalling $500 totalling 1 months of food prorated for 11 days
at $16.13 per day.
 
33.
The Tenant sought further
compensation for days off work. These are not damages
that the Board can consider, and they will not be awarded.
 
34. The Tenant has sought and will be awarded the filing fee of $48.00.
 
It is ordered:
 
35. The Tenant shall receive an abatement of rent of $694.84 ($1795/31
days = $57.90/day x 12 days) from July 9th, 2021 to July
20th, 2021, which reflects the dates from when the unit’s locks were changed
until the Tenant was returned the keys.
 
36.
The Landlord shall
pay to the Tenant $2464.69 which is the reasonable out of pocket expenses the Tenant has incurred for moving, storage, hydro and insurance
expenses.
 
37. The total amount
the Landlord owes is $3159.53.
 
38. The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by January
23, 2022.




 
39. If the Landlord does
not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by January 30th, 2022, the Tenant will owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31st, 2022 at 2.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
 
40.
The
Tenant has the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
