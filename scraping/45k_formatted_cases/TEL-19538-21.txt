Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19538-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


102, 1475 KINGSTON ROAD SCARBOROUGH ON M1N1R5


 




Between:


1034523 Ontario Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Loretta
Kikot


Tenant



 
 
 
1034523 Ontario
Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Loretta Kikot (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin attended
the hearing. As of 11:11 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April
1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $962.13.
 
4.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $895.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2016 to August 31, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenant
paid $2,540.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $8,585.77*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
17, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $31.59
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,192.15** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
January 17, 2022                                                                                    Date Issued                                                                       Richard Ferriss
