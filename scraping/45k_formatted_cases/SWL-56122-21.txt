Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56122-21



In the
  matter of:


507, 1491 PILLETTE ROAD WINDSOR ON N8Y4S9


 




Between:


Regent Properties (London) Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gurvir Gill


Tenant



 
 
Regent Properties (London) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gurvir Gill (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Jessica Lapkowski, attended the hearing.
As of 10:25 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Preliminary Issues:
 
The application is amended to
reflect that the Tenant paid $50.00 towards the October 2021’s lawful monthly
rent. Accordingly, the rent arrears
owing as of the date the application was filed on October 28, 2021 were $944.90.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 27, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $994.90.
4.     
The Tenant paid $3,120.70 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $925.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the




File Number: SWL-56122-21
 
Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $712.64*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 24, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.71 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  $1,989.80 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)  $2,984.70 if the payment is made on or before
March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
