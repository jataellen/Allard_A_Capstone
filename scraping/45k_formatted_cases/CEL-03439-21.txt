Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03439-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


A,
  4 DUNCAN STREET E HUNTSVILLE ON P1H1V9


 




Between:


Francis Botham


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jade Forth


Tenant



 
 
 
Francis Botham (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jade Forth
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises; because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
seriously impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord has also applied for
an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any
person
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant, represented by Meghan MacDonald, attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord was represented by Martin Calderon
but requested to be removed
as legal counsel for the Landlord.
 
The Landlord was asked
if she wished to proceed
without legal representation. The Landlord
confirmed she wished to proceed with the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served an N7 notice on the Tenant. This notice provides that there is no
opportunity for a tenant to void the order by repairing or paying for repairs to damage that may have been wilfully caused, the
an impairment of safety is serious, and that if successful in obtaining an
eviction, the Sheriff is instructed to enforce an order before other orders due
to the seriousness of the damage or the seriously impaired safety.
 
2.     The Landlord’s notice
points to loud parties disturbing the Tenant in Unit B, used needles disposed about the property,
people entering through a broken window, the behaviour of the Tenant, including yelling fighting, loud music and
vulgar language. The notice also
alleges the Tenant was naked in a small children’s pool.




File Number: CEL-03439-21
 
 
 
3.     I find none of these allegations cannot
be considered wilful
damage of seriously
impaired safety.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
