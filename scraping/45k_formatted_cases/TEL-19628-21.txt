Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TEL-19628-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


A306, 400 BLOOR
STREET E OSHAWA ON L1H3M8


 




Between:


Cher-Brook Properties Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Raquel
Stephens


Tenant



 
Cher-Brook Properties Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Raquel Stephens (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 5, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Teresa Williams, and Tenant's Legal Representative, Rachel
Taube, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Rachel Taube presented
evidence to show that she was not in possession of the rental unit at the time
the Landlord filed the application and the Landlord conceded that the Board does not have jurisdiction to hear an application against
Rachel Taube. As a result, Rachel Taube is removed as a party
to these proceedings.
 
2.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
20, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,149.75.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $500.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord incurred charges of $10.00 for cheques
tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant, which were
returned NSF and $40.00 for related administration charges.
 
7.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,149.75 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.




 
9.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$4,826.25*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 17, 2022 and the total charges related
to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent
deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $37.80
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 29, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $6,634.50** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
29, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
January 17, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Richard Ferriss
