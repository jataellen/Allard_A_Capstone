Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jean Lenoir (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
13, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Rebecca Osmond, attended the hearing. As of 3:21 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 1, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $500.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $40.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated effective
November 1, 2021,
when the Tenant
returned vacant possession of
the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44159-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,020.00*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
November 1, 2021 and the total charges related
to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
