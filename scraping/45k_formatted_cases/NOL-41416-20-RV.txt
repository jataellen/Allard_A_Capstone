Review Order
 
Consolidated Homes Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Parmar Swatantar (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order NOL-41416-20 issued on November
30, 2021.
 
On December 10, 2021, the
Landlord requested a review
of the order alleging the order contained serious error because
it contained incorrect payment information and arrears.
 
The request was heard by way of video conference on February 10,2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agent, Laura Dickson attended
the hearing. As of 1:19 pm, the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Request to Review
 
1.       
The Landlord’s Agent testified
that the order contains incorrect payment and arrears of rent information. At paragraph 2 and 3 of the order,
the Member found that the there was
conflicting information in the application and notices which resulted in the
Landlord’s application being dismissed. At the hearing,
the Landlord’s Agent presented the evidence
submitted at the first hearing, being the notices, the application and L1/L9
update sheet.
 
2.       
In review of the evidence, I am
satisfied that the order issued on November 30, 2021 contains serious error
with respect to the application having been dismissed based on conflicting
information about payments and calculation of arrears. In making my finding, I
considered the compelling evidence of the Landlord’s Agent that in fact the payments and




 
calculations presented at the initial
hearing were consistent with the calculations in the N4 Notice of Termination, the L1
application and L1/L9 update sheet.
 
3.       
Given my finding that the order
issued on November
30, 2021 contains
serious error as alleged by the Landlord, the
Landlord’s request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
4.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November

5.       
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.
