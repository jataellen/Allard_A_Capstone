R.Z. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.D. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration
charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 16, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, C.P.S.C.,
and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 3, 2018
to June 2, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 11, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending May 31, 2018, total $8,400.00. 
3.     
The Landlord paid $175.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Landlord incurred
charges of $80.00 for administration charges related to cheques tendered by or
on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned NSF.
5.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 2, 2017 to April 11, 2018,
in the amount of $23.10.
7.     
Based on the Tenant’s
current monthly income and expenses, it is clear that she can barely afford to
live in the rental unit. It is also clear that the Tenant cannot afford to pay
off the very substantial arrears that have continued to accumulate since
February 2018. 
8.     
The Tenant’s financial
circumstances are not set to improve in the near future. Even though the Tenant
says she currently has $4,000.00 in her bank account, she provided no documentary
evidence to the Board to corroborate her testimony. She could not explain why,
if she had substantial funds in her account, she has failed to pay any rent for
the last several months. 
9.     
The Tenant says that she
will be receiving a substantial commission from her employment in the amount of
several thousand dollars. However, the Tenant provided no documentary evidence
to support her testimony and I find her testimony not to be credible. 
10.  
The Tenant has lived in the
rental unit since September 2017 along with her two older children ages 16 and
20. The Tenant says the two children are attending school in the area. 
11.  
The Tenant is seeking relief
from eviction in the form of a delay of 3 months. However, due to the very
substantial arrears and the Tenant’s obvious inability to pay those arrears, I
find that it would be unfair to grant such a lengthy delay. Instead, a short
delay of 2 weeks should provide the Tenant and her older children sufficient
time to find new accommodations. 
12.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until June 12, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 12,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $5,332.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 18, 2018 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the
Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 19, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 29, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 30,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 12, 2018, then starting June 13, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 13, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $8,655.00 if the payment is made on or before June 2, 2018, or
ii)       $10,735.00 if the payment is made on or before June 12, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 13, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
