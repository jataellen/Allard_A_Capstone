Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12899-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


601, 10 CAPREOL CRT. TORONTO ON M5V4B3


 




Between:


Noor Kapur Aman Kapur


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Janet Ridgeway William Ridgeway


Tenants



 
 
 
On January 29, 2022, Noor Kapur
and Aman Kapur (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Janet
Ridgeway and William
Ridgeway (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or
before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after March 1, 2022.
