Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-25977-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


512, 200 MANITOBA STREET TORONTO ON M8Y3Y9


 




Between:


Ryan Pornasdoro


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth Hallett


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 21, 2021, Ryan
Pornasdoro (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Elizabeth Hallett (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
entered into an agreement
to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
January 1, 2022
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




File Number: TSL-25977-22
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under

the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
