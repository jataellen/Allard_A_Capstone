Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-13075-20
 
 
In the matter of:      MAIN FLOOR, 156 OVERTURE ROAD
SCARBOROUGH ON M1E2W4
 




Between:                  Md. Saiful Islam Faiza Khan


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Joshua Gallagher Samantha Gallagher


Tenants




 
 
 
Md. Saiful Islam and Faiza Khan (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Joshua Gallagher and Samantha Gallagher (the 'Tenants') because the
Landlords require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on June 29, 2021, beginning at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative Muhammad
Alam and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlords applied for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants because the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The intended occupants are the Landlord, the
Landlord’s spouse, the Landlord’s parent, the Landlord’s children and the
Landlord’s spouse’s parent.
 
2.       
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. The monthly rent is $1,700.00.
 
3.       
On October 19, 2020 the Landlords
served a valid N12 Notice of Termination with a termination
date of December 31, 2020.
 
4.       
The Landlords paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on November
17, 2020. The Landlords have met all of the technical requirements of subsection
48(1) of the Act and have paid the required compensation before the
termination date in accordance with subsection 55(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).




 
5.       
The Landlord S.I. provided a
declaration dated June 17, 2021, affirming that he and his family members
require the rental
unit in good faith for a period of at least
one year. The declaration complies with the
technical requirements of subsection 72(1) of the Act.
 
6.       
The Tenant S.G. testified
that the Tenants
had an existing residential lease agreement
with the former Landlord at the time when S.I. and F.K. purchased the property.
 
7.       
She stated that when S.I. and F.K. assumed
responsibility for the residential complex,
S.I. and his father-in-law introduced themselves and said that they were
happy to have them as tenants. S.G. testified that S.I. then proceeded to
inform her that the rent was to be increased immediately by $300.00 to
$2,000.00 per month. Additionally, the Tenants would have to pay an additional
amount for parking and pay another last month’s rent deposit to the Landlords.
S.G. objected to this new arrangement. Ten days later, she said, they were served with the N12
Notice.
 
8.       
She testified that she and her
partner have notified the Landlords that there are numerous outstanding repairs needed in the unit. The Tenants
did not submit
in advance, or serve the
Landlords, any evidence relating to the section 82 maintenance and repair
issues as required by the Board.
 
9.       
The Tenant J.G. stated that the
stove was not working and that they had to use a microwave for several months
until he purchased a stove on December 29, 2020. The Landlord has not repaired the stove and has not reimbursed him for
the cost of the
stove. The toilet needs to be repaired. There is a pest infestation within the
unit. Although the Tenants informed the Landlords, the Landlords have failed to respond. J.G. stated that he
expended his own money for pest control and for other materials and supplies to perform necessary repairs in the unit.
 
10.   
The Tenants believe that the Landlords
intend to evict the Tenants in order to avoid the repair issues and to re-rent the unit
at a higher rent.
 
11.    The Tenants did not provide
specifics as to the dates and times relating to the Landlords’ alleged breaches of their
repair and maintenance obligations, or any documentary evidence to support the
allegations. Therefore, there was inadequate evidence upon which to determine
whether the Landlords were in serious breach of their obligations under the Act
when the N12 Notice was served. The Tenants are entitled to commence their own application(s) against
the Landlords with respect
to seeking a remedy for these issues.
 
12.    I found S.G.’s testimony regarding the communications from S.I. about
the rent increase was straightforward and
credible. I note that at no time during the hearing did the Landlords dispute
the Tenants’ evidence.
 
13.   
It is reasonable to conclude that
the Landlords requested a substantial increase in rent, plus an unlawful
deposit on the last month’s rent, and that this request was contemporaneous to the service
of the N12 Notice. When the Tenants
objected to having to pay the Landlords more money,
the Landlords served the N12 Notice. I find that it is




 
more likely than not that the Landlords served the Notice
in order to evict the Tenants and to raise the rent for the unit.
 
14.    On the basis of the evidence before
me, I am therefore satisfied
on the balance of
probabilities that the Landlords served the N12 Notice in bad faith.
 
15.    The Landlords’ application shall be dismissed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
