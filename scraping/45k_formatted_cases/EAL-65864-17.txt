Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-65864-17










 
 
 

LB
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CB
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard in Kingston on July 12, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to
pay for the period from September 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.  Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 6,
2017.
2.     
The Landlord incurred charges of $80.00 for administration charges
related to cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which were returned
NSF.
3.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,310.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
4.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period
from December 1, 2013 to June 6, 2017.
5.     
The Tenant paid $800.00 after the application was filed.
6.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before August 15, 2017.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,467.19*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to August 4, 2017 and the total
charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the
Tenant, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.41 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting August 5, 2017 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before August 15, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from August 16, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated on or before August 15, 2017, then
starting August 16, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
August 16, 2017.
7.     
If, on or before August 15, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of
$11,011.04** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after August 16, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

REASONS
 
 










 
 
 

Reasons
to Order EAL-65864-17 issued on July 21, 2017 by Thomas F. Fagan.
 
The
Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques and the cost of filing
the application.
 
This
application was heard in Kingston on July 12, 2017. The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
REASONS
 

I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the
     Landlord’s application for the payment of rental arrears and costs in the
     amount of $9,299.24 for the period commencing September 1, 2016 and ending
     July 31, 2017 should be granted.

 

I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
     in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
     2006 (the Act), and find that, on a balance of probabilities it would
     be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
     the Act for the following reasons.

 

I reach the foregoing conclusion based on the
     Landlord’s detailed and comprehensive written evidence and oral testimony
     that indicates that the Tenant had provided several reasons to the Landlord
     for not paying the lawful monthly rent since October 2016 and made
     repeated promises of finding the means to pay the rent owed.

 

Furthermore, I find that the N4 Notice of
     Termination for non-payment of rent dated May 23, 2017 is consistent with
     the information in the L1 Application and with the comprehensive written
     documentary evidence submitted by the Landlord in support of the
     application.

 

I find that the NSF cheques dated September 7, 2016,
     October 5, 2016 and November 1, 2016 are consistent with the Landlord’s evidence
     that the Tenant intended to pay the monthly rent of $1,330.96. I accept
     the Landlord’s evidence that the Tenant requested that the Landlord not
     cash the cheques. 

 

Furthermore, the Landlord’s evidence is that the
     Tenant paid $400.00 towards the monthly rent in November and December 2016
     and in January 2017 respectively. The Landlord’s documentary evidence also
     indicates that the Tenant paid $800.00 towards the rent in March, April,
     May and June 2017 respectively. I find that evidence to be consistent with
     the Landlord’s oral evidence and inconsistent with the Tenant’s oral
     evidence that she was not required to pay rent in exchange for performing
     duties.

 

I find that, although the Tenant claimed that she
     was unaware that she had to pay for rent owing – she thought it was a gift
     in exchange of performing light duties on behalf of the Landlord, the
     Landlord’s evidence is that the Tenant continued to pay a portion of the
     rent until July 2017. I find the Landlord’s evidence to be consistent with
     the other evidence before me and it supports the Landlord’s evidence in
     support of the application. Thus I find the Landlord’s evidence consistent
     and reliable.

 

I find that, other than her testimony during the
     hearing, the Tenant has not provided any documentary or other evidence to corroborate
     and to support her claim that the Landlord had forgiven the rental
     arrears. 

 

After serious consideration of all of the evidence
     before me, I accept and prefer the Landlord’s evidence. I find the
     Landlord’s evidence to be the best evidence in this matter because the
     Tenant’s uncorroborated oral evidence is illogical, unreliable and lacks
     the ring of truth. The Tenant did not present any evidence as to the
     nature and extent of the light duties and whether such performance was in
     exchange of a full or partial amount of rent owed. As I explained to the
     Tenant at the hearing, her position would have had more merit on a balance
     of probabilities had it been supported by evidence to corroborate her oral
     testimony.

 

Therefore, for all of these reasons, I find on a
     balance of probabilities that the Tenant owes the Landlord $9,299.24 for
     rental arrears, cost relating to NSF cheques and the Landlord’s cost of
     filing the application.
