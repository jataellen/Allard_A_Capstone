Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35709-19
 
 
DR (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the
Landlords' maintenance obligations under the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') that the Landlords substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld
or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are obligated
to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on
June 16, 2021 VC75 and on July 22, 2021in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75. Only the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing
on June 16, 2021 and only the Tenant’s
representative, AB-S, attended
the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my
determinations on the liability of the Landlords pertaining to events
leading up to the Park’s closure and the availability of
remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf
of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief
for the discontinuance of power to the Park. A separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by
each of the fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and
inactions pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and
the effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35709-19 is
one of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded to completion on July
22, 2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier
appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-35709-19 proceeded on June
16, 2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of March 2018 and throughout the period
June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)     The above failures, combined with the Landlords’
decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018,
attract various remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October
2018 effective closure
and others pertaining to events following
that effective closure.
 
2.   
The Tenant claims for two classes
of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior to the Park’s effective closure in October 2018;; and second;
those attributable to the Park’s closure.
 
3.   
I
find the following
facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant and, where indicated, on certain documents
filed with the Board as Tab M of the Tenants’ productions;
 
a)     The Tenant paid rent of $400.00 per month at the Park;
 
b)     The sewage problems
at the Park were ongoing.
The Tenant was impacted by the
presence of raw sewage and by the water problems;
 
c)     
The Tenant was forced
to stay at the Park following its closure as she had nowhere
else to go until September 2020, when she finally left;
 
d)     The Tenant incurred
the following costs
to stay in the Park in
the face of no water, sewage service or power (Refer
receipts produced at Tab M-6 of the Tenants’ productions):




 
 
 
i)                   
$1,385.16 for purchase of a generator
($438.41), a wood stove ($500.00), a chainsaw and miscellaneous tools and
equipment for power and heat;
 
ii)                 
$363.02 for gas; and
 
iii)                
$20.00 for showers.
 
e)    
The Tenant suffered negative
impacts during her occupancy of the Park following the Park’s closure;
 
f)       The Tenant vacated
the Park in September 2020; and
 
g)     The Tenant was unable to move or sell her mobile home such that its value was lost.
 
First Type of Remedies - for the Period Prior
to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I
have considered compensation for events occurring between March
12 2018, being one year prior to the
date on this application was filed, and October 30, 2018, when the Park was
effectively closed.
 
5.    I find that the Tenant is
entitled to a rebate of $150.00, being 5% of the
$400.00 rent which she paid for 7 ½ months from mid-March 2018 (being one
year before the filing of the Tenant’s application with the Board) through
October 2018;
 
6.   
I find that the Tenant is entitled
to a rebate of $300.00, being 10% of the of the $400.00 monthly rent which they paid for 7 ½ months from mid-March 2018 October 2018 for
the impacts of the Landlords’ failure to maintain or repair the sewage
system.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
7.   
For the second type of remedies, as et out in the Base Order,
I find the following:
 
a)    
The Tenant is not entitled to compensation for the lost value of the mobile
home;
 
b)     The Tenant is entitled to compensation for her
out of pocket costs associated with living at the
Park without water, sewage or power services; and
 
c)     
The Tenant may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
8.    I find that the Tenant is
entitled to $1,768.18 for the out of pocket costs incurred
to stay at the Park, in absence of power, water or
sewage services, during the 9 month shortfall in
the Landlord’s notice of closure.
 
9.     I find that the Tenant’s continued occupancy of the
Park in the face of its effective closure was reasonable in circumstances she
they had no other place to go. That
circumstance was directly linked to the inadequate notice
given by the Landlords for the Park’s closure. I




 
find that the Tenant’s
reasonable enjoyment was negatively impacted
by the expedited closure of
the Park. I find that a damages award
of $1,500.00 is appropriate in the circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $3,718.18, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $450.00 for the impacts
of the compromised water supply
and problems with the sewage system;
 
b)     $3,718.18 for out of pockets
costs to stay at the Park; and
 
c)      $1,500.00 for damages.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
