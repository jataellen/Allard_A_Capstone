Tenants




 
 
 
6965083 Canada Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kenedy Lukwata,
Jane Sekaziga Namusoke
and George William Lubega (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 2,
2021 with respect to application TNL-30901-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TNL-35049-21, issued on October
28, 2021. On November 4, 2021
the Tenants filed a motion to set aside the order.
This motion was heard by video
conference on December
16, 2021.
 
The Landlord's Legal
Representative Faith McGregor attended the hearing. The Tenants’ Agent Mary
Adero attended on behalf of the Tenant Kenedy Lukwata. The Tenants Jane
Sekaziga Namusoke and George
William Lubega were not present
or represented at this hearing,
although properly served with a notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Landlord filed
an application claiming
that the Tenants
failed to comply
with the conditions of the
consent order TNL-30901-21, issued on September 2, 2021.
 
2.      On October 28, 2021, the Board determined that the Tenants
had breached the terms as alleged, and issued Order TNL-35049-21,
cancelling Order TNL-30901-21 and terminating the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants.
 
3.     
The Tenants seek an order setting aside Order TNL-35049-21.




 
4.      There are three Tenants, who constitute adult
family members, residing
in the rental unit. In the
motion, the Tenants are seeking additional time to pay for the arrears of rent.
 
5.      As a preliminary matter, the Tenant’s Agent M.A.
appeared before the Board to request an adjournment on behalf of one of the
Tenants, K.L. She explained that K.L. needed to attend his father’s burial.
M.A. did not offer further details. Neither the Tenant or M.A. sought to submit any objective evidence
in support of the
request, either prior to or at the hearing. Neither of the other Tenants
appeared at the hearing.
 
6.      The Landlord's Legal Representative F.M. opposed the
adjournment, on the basis that none of the Tenants were present, and that the Landlord was not apprised
of the situation in advance, or asked to consent to the adjournment
prior to the hearing, despite the Tenants being able to communicate with the
Landlord.
 
7.      Additionally, F.M. submits,
(i) M.A. represents only one Tenant K.L., and (ii) K.L. has not provided the Landlord or the Board
with the requisite written authorization to act on his behalf at the hearing.
 
8.     
I am not satisfied that the
Tenant’s friend was duly authorized to appear and represent the Tenants. I find that the Tenant, or Tenants, were not precluded from
requesting that the matter be
rescheduled before the hearing, or from seeking the consent of the Landlord to adjourn the motion. I also find that
the Tenant, or the Tenants,
had sufficient time to
properly authorize a person, in writing, to represent them at the hearing.
 
9.      The Landlord also submits that the motion
should be dismissed on the
basis that only one of the
Tenants commenced the set aside motion. As I understand it, it is the
Landlord’s position that the motion to set aside ought to name all of the
Tenants and be signed by all of the Tenants in order to be properly
considered by the Board.
 
10.   Respectfully, I disagree. Any of the named Tenants in
a joint tenancy is entitled to commence a set aside
motion, and the resulting order applies to the entire tenancy and all of the Tenants. The presumption is that the Tenant bringing
the motion is proceeding
on behalf of all of the Tenants. Therefore, this submission shall not be
considered.
 
11.   Based on the evidence before
me, and weighing
the prejudice to both parties,
the Tenant’s request for an adjournment is denied.
 
12.   In the particular circumstances, the parties are
encouraged to communicate and explore whether there is a resolution which would
be mutually satisfactory to both prior to the enforcement of the order.
It is for this purpose that I will order a brief delay in the lifting of the stay of Order TNL-35049-21.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The motion to set aside Order TNL-35049-21 is dismissed.
 
2.       
The stay of order TNL-35049-21 is lifted as of January
22, 2022.
