Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56218-21



In the
  matter of:


507, 180
CANTERBURY COURT SARNIA ON
  N7T7S3


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michael McDonald
  Patricia McDonald


Tenants



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Patricia
McDonald and Michael
McDonald (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 3, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Ayden Pearson, attended the hearing. As
of 3:27 p.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October
1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 20, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of February 1, 2022 is
$1,123.32.
4.    
The Tenants paid $4,440.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,110.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.




File Number: SWL-56218-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $185.91*.
 
3.    
However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenants: $36.93 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting February 25, 2022 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and $186.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  $1,309.32 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)  $2,432.64 if the payment is made on or before
March 7, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
