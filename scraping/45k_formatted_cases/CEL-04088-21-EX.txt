Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04088-21-EX
 
 



In the matter
of:


101, 170 GROVE
STREET E BARRIE ON L4M2P7


 




Between:


Siteline (170 Grove)
Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberley Zona


Tenant



 
 
 
Siteline (170
Grove) Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Kimberley Zona (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on October 4, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-01103-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $2,000.00 towards
the arrears, rent and costs on or before November 5, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $8,293.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-01103-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $8,293.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-01103-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2020
to January 5, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-01103-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $11,756.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 5, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
