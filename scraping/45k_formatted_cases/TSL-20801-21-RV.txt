Review Order
 
Imh Pool II Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jad Jaber (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-20801-21 issued on October
20, 2021. On November 16,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative T. Radam and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The parties agree that before
the hearing giving rise to the order under review
the Tenant had paid all
arrears and compensation owed to the Landlord as well as the filing fee.
The order finds that the Tenant owes arrears and orders the Tenant to pay
arrears and the fee. The Tenant vacated the unit prior to the hearing.
 
2.     Based on the facts agreed
by the parties, I found
at the hearing that there
was a serious error in the order. Accordingly, I granted the Tenant’s
request for a review. The original order must be cancelled and replaced with a
new order.
 
L1 application
 
3.     Based on the agreed facts, pursuant to subsection 74(2)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, the Landlord’s L1
application is discontinued.
