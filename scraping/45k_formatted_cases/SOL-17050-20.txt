Damion Wright Tanychia Black


Tenants




 
 
 
Abdullah Hassan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Damion Wright and Tanychia Black (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on June 23, 2021, beginning at 9:00 a.m..
 
The Landlord and the Landlord's Legal
Representative Heather Barnes
attended the hearing.
As of 9:57 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at this
hearing although properly served with the notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 6, 2020 to July 5,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September 12, 2020.
 
2.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from December 2, 2019
to September 12, 2020.
 
4.       
The monthly rent is $2,400.00.
 
5.       
The Tenants paid $2,200.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.       
The Tenants owe $40,665.20 to the Landlord
for arrears of rent to July 5, 2021.




 
7.       
On September 17, 2020 the Landlord
served an N7 Notice to End Your Tenancy on the
Tenants with a termination date of September 30, 2020.
 
8.       
On September 16, 2020,
the Landlord inspected the rental unit and discovered substantial damage to the
unit.
 
9.       
The Landlord claims that The
Tenants or an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenants
have wilfully caused undue damage to the rental unit and/or
residential complex as follows:
 
•        
damage to the carpets
•        
large stains throughout the residence
•        
toilet damaged to the extent it requires replacement
•        
the walls are covered
with markers, crayons
and adhesives
•        
accumulation of dirt/grime, debris
and clutter
 
10.    The Landlord introduced into evidence numerous
photographs and video recordings of the damages allegedly caused to the
rental unit by the Tenants. I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Tenants
have negligently or wilfully caused significant
damage to the rental premises.
 
11.    The Landlord is not seeking compensation to repair the
damage and/ or to replace property that was damaged and cannot be repaired, and no amount
for compensation was claimed
in the N7 Notice or the L2 application.
 
12.   
The Landlord’s
claim for arrears of rent for the period ending July 5, 2021 exceeds the
Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord indicated a desire to proceed
with the hearing of the application and voluntarily waived the portion of the
claim that exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
13.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. The Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
shall be requested to expedite the enforcement of the order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
The L1 Application
 
1.       
Unless the Tenants void the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.




 
3.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$78.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting July 6, 2021 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the applications.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 16,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.       
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust
$35,000.00, this order for
eviction based on arrears of rent will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated on the basis of arrears
of rent. If the Tenants
do not make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.       
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the order for termination based on arrears of rent if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after January 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
The L2 Application
 
10.   
Even if the Tenants void this
order as set out in paragraph 9, above, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is still terminated as of January 15, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the unit on
or before January 15, 2022.
 
11.    If the unit is not vacated on or before January 15, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is
directed to give vacant possession to the Landlord after January 16, 2022 on an
expedited basis.
