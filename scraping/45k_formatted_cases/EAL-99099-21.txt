In the
  matter of:


308, 1350
KENSINGTON PARKWAY
  BROCKVILLE ON K6V6B9


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Denise Chenier
  Tyler Green


Tenants



 
 
 
Siteline (760-800 Laurier) LP
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyler
Green and Denise Chenier (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants
pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on June
17, 2021 with respect to application EAL-92774-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order: The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before December 1,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $3,546.13 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-92774-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $1,513.53 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-92774-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,124.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from October 1, 2019 to
January 14, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-92774-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,875.08*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 14, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$37.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 15, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
25, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 26, 2022.

The tenant has until January 24, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 24, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 26, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
