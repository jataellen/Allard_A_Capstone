Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-20341-18
 











 
 

HZ (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict DR (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; used the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner
that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has caused or
can be expected to cause significant damage; substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant; and seriously impaired the safety of any person.  The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlord for the damage and claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (the ‘L2
Application’).
 
These applications were heard in Woodstock
on October 5, 2018.  Only the Landlord’s Agent, FZ,
attended the hearing.  As of 11:05 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from July 1, 2018 to October 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 17, 2018.
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $500.00.
4.     The Landlord is not holding a last month’s rent
deposit. 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed. 
Wilful or Negligent Damage
6.     The Tenant, an occupant of the rental unit or
her invited guest drilled a peephole through the entrance door to the rental
unit, thereby voiding its fire safety rating.
7.     The Tenant, an occupant of the rental unit or
her invited guest also destroyed the metal housing and the plate glass for a
fire extinguisher in the residential complex.
8.     As a result, I find that the Tenant, an occupant
of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the
Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit and
the residential complex.
9.     On July 2, 2018, the Landlord served the Tenant
with an N5 Notice to terminate the tenancy (the ‘N5 Notice’) pursuant to
subsections 62(1) and 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).
10.  The Landlord will incur costs of $490.00 to repair the
damage and replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
11.  As the Tenant did not pay any compensation to the Landlord
for the cost to repair or replace the damage to the premises, I find that the
Tenant failed to void the N5 Notice pursuant to subsection 62(3) of the Act.
Alteration to Lock 
12.  The Landlord also sought compensation for the cost to
replace the locking system to the rental unit as the Tenant had altered the
locks without his consent.
13.  However, the Act specifically addresses unauthorized
alterations to a locking system of the rented premises under section 35 of the
Act apart from other provisions.  Subsections 35(2) and (3) of the Act set out
the procedure and remedies available to the Landlord in relation to a breach of
subsection 35(1) of the Act:
35.   
(2) If
a tenant alters a locking system, contrary to subsection (1), the landlord may
apply to the Board for an order determining that the tenant has altered the
locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit or the residential
complex or caused the locking system to be altered during the tenant’s
occupancy of the rental unit without the consent of the landlord.  
 
(3) If the Board in an application under
subsection (2) determines that a tenant has altered the locking system or
caused it to be altered, the Board may order that the tenant provide the
landlord with keys or pay the landlord the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
necessary to change the locking system.  
 
14.  The Landlord did not file the required L8 Application under
subsection 35(2) of the Act with respect to the Tenant’s alteration of the
locking system.  As well, termination of the tenancy is not an available remedy
under subsection 35(2) of the Act.  While the Tenant’s actions may have
interfered with the Landlord’s right of access to the rental unit, this conduct
in and of itself does not permit the Landlord to serve a notice of termination.
15.  I find that had the legislature intended that unauthorized
alteration of a locking system to fall under the subject matter of section 64
of the Act, they would not have drafted section 35 to address precisely this
very situation.
16.  By including this conduct in the N5 Notice and the L2
Application, the Landlord has attempted to obtain a remedy that would not
otherwise be available under the proper L8 Application.  
17.  As a result, the Landlord may not rely upon the Tenant’s
alteration of the locking system to the rental unit to terminate the tenancy.
18.  Similarly, as the alteration of the locking system did not
result in any damage to the rental unit, the cost of replacement also does not
qualify as compensable damage pursuant to subsection 89(1) of the Act.  Compensation
for the cost of changing the lock is only available under an L8 Application.
Vagueness in N5 and N7 Notices
19.  As noted above, the N5 Notice also addressed allegations
that the Tenant, an occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
into the residential complex substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.  The Landlord also served the Tenant with an N7 Notice of termination
(the ‘N7 Notice’) on the same day, pursuant to subsections 63(1) and 66(1) of
the Act.
20.   However, I find that the N7 Notice and the
portions of the N5 Notice related to substantial interference are unduly vague as
they lack necessary references to specific details including dates and times
for the allegations.  While the Landlord may have intended to lead direct
evidence of the Tenant’s alleged misconduct at the hearing, the problem lies in
the actual text of the originating document – the N5 Notice – which is the document
against which the respondent Tenant must craft her answer.  I find on the
balance of probabilities that the vague allegations contained in both notices
frustrated her ability to fully and properly respond to the application.  If
the Tenant is deprived of the ability to know the precise dates and substance
of various allegations prior to the hearing, the missing information
necessarily compromises her defence.
21.   According to the Ontario
Divisional Court’s decisions in both Kuzyk
v. S.K. Properties[1]
and Ball v. Metro Capital Property and Lockhurst,[2] if a Notice of termination
issued by a landlord is confusing to the degree that a reasonable person could
not understand the precise actions or omissions that caused the landlord to
pursue eviction, a Member would find it defective.  Specifically, the
Court in Ball stated that “particulars should include dates and times of
the alleged offensive conduct, together with a detailed description of the
alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant.”[3] 

22.   In the present case, I find that the entire N7
Notice and the N5 Notice as it pertains to substantial interference are
defective as both are excessively vague and devoid of necessary details with respect
to the allegations that provide the basis for the application.  The Landlord
may not rely upon the N7 Notice or the portions of the N5 Notice that relate to
substantial interference to terminate the tenancy.
23.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
24.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,338.29*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 11,
2018.
2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $16.44
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 12, 2018 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before October 22, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from October 23, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
The L2 Application
5.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated as of October 22, 2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before October 22, 2018.
6.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $490.00,
which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and replacing the
damaged property.
7.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before October 22, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from October 23, 2018 at
3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.     If the unit is not vacated on or before October
22, 2018, then starting October 23, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord on or after October 23, 2018. 
Service of Order to the Tenant 
10.  Due to a potential Canada Post strike, the Landlord must
immediately give a copy of this Order to the Tenant by:
a.    handing it to the Tenant;
b.    handing it to an apparently adult person at the
rental unit;
c.    leaving it in the Tenant’s mailbox;  
d.    if there is no mailbox, leaving it at the place
where mail is ordinarily delivered to the Tenant; 
e.    placing a copy of the order under the door of
the rental unit or through a mail slot in the door; or
f.     
if there is a fax machine at
the rental unit or where the Tenant carries on business, by fax.
11.  The Landlord shall not use regular mail, registered mail,
Xpresspost or any courier service used by Canada Post to deliver the Order.
