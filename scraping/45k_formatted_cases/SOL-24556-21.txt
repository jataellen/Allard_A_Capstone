Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24556-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BARN APARTMENT, 527 GENEVA STREET ST. CATHARINES ON L2N2H7


 




Between:


Weiru Li


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ethan
Brouwer Hani Jafri


Tenants



 
 
Weiru Li (the
'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Hani Jafri and Ethan Brouwer (the
'Tenants') to pay compensation for the damages
caused by them or a person they permitted in the residential complex
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative, Karen Wong attended
the hearing. Stephen Berber attended
as witness for the Landlord. I am satisfied the Tenants were properly served
with Notice of Hearing. Karen Wong also testified and provided the Board
a copy of the disclosed evidence sent to the Tenants by email in
advance of this hearing to hanijafri25@gmail.com and brouwer1998@hotmail.com.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s Representative requested the consent
of the Board to withdraw a portion
of the application requesting an order to terminate the tenancy finding the
Tenants abandoned which was granted.
 
2.    
In order to consider
the Landlord’s claim for damage
of $3,948.00 under
section 89 of the
Act, the Tenants must be in possession of the rental unit on September 10, 2021
when the application was filed. This is not an L10 application for out of
pocket expenses and damage filed under section 88.1 of the Act.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s
application states, “on Sept.
4th, I visited the apartment for additional
information the engineer inspection required. Steven Barber, the Tenant lives in
the main house on the same property, saw me and told me on the evening of Sept.3rd, Hani and Ethan had told him that thy have
completely moved out. I opened the apartment door and saw all furniture and
personal items are gone””. The application also indicated the Tenants told him
they were moving on September 2, 2021 while he
was in the unit with the Fire Marshall inspecting the rental unit. Based
on the information from the Landlord on the application it appears the Tenants
vacated the unit and the Board has no jurisdiction to consider the damage
claim.




 
4.    
On September 21, 2021,
however, the Board held a hearing of application SOL-22751-21 which the Tenants and the Landlord
attended which satisfies me that the Tenants were still in possession of the
rental unit when the application was filed. The Board’s interim order confirms
the Tenant as of September 21, 2021 were still in possession of the rental
unit. Interim order SOL-22751-21 issued on October 26, 2021 states, “The Tenants stated they are still in
possession of the keys to the unit; however, they are residing in another
residence until the fire code issues are resolved by the Landlord.”
 
5.    
It’s important to note
that this application although filed
after September 1, 2021, was not
filed pursuant to the amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
made by Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020
(Bill 184) specifically section 88. 1 of the Act.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s request for costs
to remove garbage
is not considered under section
89 of the Act as it is not a
physical damage to the rental unit nor is this an application made under
section 88.4 of the Act for out of pocket expenses. For the same reason, I also
have no jurisdiction to consider out of pocket expenses for missing furniture.
This is not a situation where the application can be amended. As such, I only
considered evidence about the bedroom closet door, bedroom door and missing
door handle, and bedroom floor.
 
Closet door:
 
7.    
The photograph confirms
the bedroom closet door is split on the top right of one closet door of the bedroom. I find on a balance of probability the Tenants wilfully
or negligently caused undue
damage to the bedroom closet door. The Tenants owe the Landlord reasonable replacement costs in the amount of $200.00 as supported by the quote from
Great Falls Decorative Engineering Company.
Bedroom door and door
handle:
 
8.    
A photograph of the
bedroom door shows the door handle missing. On a balance of probability, the
Tenants wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to bedroom door handle. The
Landlord’s Representative also referred to damage of the bedroom interior door, however
I did not see the damage
from the photograph provided. I do not know the replacement costs for the door handle
since it was lumped together with the cost of the bedroom door on quote 1,2
and quote 3 which the Landlord provided to substantiate costs he will
incur to repair the damaged property.
 
Floor:
 
9.    
A photograph shows some very slight lifting
of the laminate flooring in a small area of the
bedroom under the window covering an estimated area of less than 2ft by 2 ft. The Landlord was not present
to testify about the condition
of the flooring before the Tenants’
moved in and SB was not working for the Landlord to know the condition of the
floors when the Tenants moved into the unit. There was not enough evidence to
establish the Tenants wilfully or negligently damaged the floor area situated
under the window in the bedroom.




 
10.  The Landlord provided three quotes (2 from
the same company). Labour costs are lumped together for all the repairs in each invoice.
Without a breakdown
of labour costs and time to repair each item, I
cannot guess what the labour costs would be for each repair.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$200.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of replacing the damaged closet door.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall also pay the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of the filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 22, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
