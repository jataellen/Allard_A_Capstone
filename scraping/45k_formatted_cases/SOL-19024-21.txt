Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-19024-21
 



In the matter
of:


34,
1505 UPPER WELLINGTON STREET HAMILTON ON L9B2J5


 




Between:


DMS Property Management Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Mckenna


Tenant



 
 
 
DMS Property
Management Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michelle Mckenna (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Frank Calcagni, attended the hearing. As
of 12:14 p.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination
effective October 21, 2020.
 
2.    
The Landlord
incurred charges of $5.00
for a cheque tendered by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,009.00.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,549.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

$16,509.00 if the payment

eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
