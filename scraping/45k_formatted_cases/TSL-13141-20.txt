Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-13141-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


1011, 5005
DUNDAS STREET W TORONTO ON M9A4Y6


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hafeez Fazl


Tenant



 
 
Toronto Community Housing Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Hafeez Fazl (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 26, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Rahel Abera, attended
the hearing. As of 2:34 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from December
1, 2018 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 30, 2019.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of February
1, 2020, the monthly
rent for the unit decreased
to $115.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $6,061.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,950.99*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $13.29
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 12, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $8,788.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March
1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
