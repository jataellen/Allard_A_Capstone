Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54428-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER, 100 CEDAR
STREET WOODSTOCK ON N4S3P8


 




Between:


Jeff
  Noels


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Hanna Chown


Tenant



 
 
 
Jeff Noels (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Hanna Chown
(the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on December 20, 2021. Only
the Landlord Jedd Noels attended the hearing. As of 10:12am
the Tenant was not present
despite receiving notice of hearing from the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is based on an N12 notice
served to the Tenant on June 18, 2021 with a termination date of
August 31, 2021. The Landlord’s N12 notice asserts
that the Landlord personally requires possession of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Landlord has
filed an affidavit pursuant to section 72(1)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(Act) certifying that he in good faith requires the rental unit for her own personal use.
 
3.    
The Landlord
has paid to the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
on June 18, 2021, pursuant to
section 48.1 of the Act.
 
4.    
The Landlord testified that the rental unit is a single
detached dwelling that consists of two
rental units. The Tenant on this application resides in the upper unit,
the Landlord resides in the
main floor and basement unit.
 
5.     The Landlord testified that his cousin and four
children require housing and intend to move into the main floor and basement
unit currently occupied by the Landlord. The
Landlord intends to move into upper unit to allow his cousin
and four children
to occupy the larger, two
floor rental unit.

6.    
Based on the
evidence before the Board I am satisfied that the Landlord in good faith
requires possession of the rental
unit for a period of at least one year. The Landlord’s testimony was credible and
consistent throughout the hearing.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
Tenant was not present to dispute the Landlord’s evidence or seek relief from
eviction.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of
February 14, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting
February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of

Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
