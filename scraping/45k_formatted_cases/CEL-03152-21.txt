Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03152-21
 



In the
  matter of:


1,
  10157 BERFORD STREET GEORGIAN BLUFFS ON N0H2T0


 




Between:


Top Notch
Restaurant & Motel


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Andrew Armour


Tenant



 
Top Notch Restaurant & Motel (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Andrew Armour (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. As of 2:27 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s agent, Alicja
Suwala-Andziak and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Jay Bradley attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 27, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful daily rent is $105.00.
 
4.     
The Tenant paid $1,950.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlord’s claim for the
period ending January 31, 2022 exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of
$35,000.00. The Landlord indicated a desire to proceed with the
hearing of the application and voluntarily waived the portion
of the claim that exceeds
the Board’s monetary jurisdiction for the period ending January 31,
2022.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Landlord has waived
the $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $35,000.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full
and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection
on or after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

In accordance with section 81 of

has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
