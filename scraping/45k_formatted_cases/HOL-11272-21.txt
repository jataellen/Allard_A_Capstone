In the
  matter of:


1526 FARROW CRESCENT INNISFIL ON L9S0L6


 




Between:


Anastasiya Nelyubina


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lalanya Riha Nicholas Stacey


Tenants



 
 
 
Anastasiya
Nelyubina (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Lalanya Riha and Nicholas Stacey (the 'Tenants') because they have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord;
and because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative, Elina Vasilieva, the Landlord’s Agent, Alex Nelyubin, the
Tenant, Lalanya Riha, and Tenant’s
Legal Representative, Ciara McMillan, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Landlord’s Application-N8 Notice of Termination
 
1.    
On July 10, 2021,
the Landlord served the Tenants
an N8 Notice of Termination (N8) with a
termination date of September 24, 2021 as the Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s Agent submitted that the Tenants
had been late with the rent twenty-two
(22) times since December
2018. The Tenants
usually paid in full but not on time.
However, the Tenants have not been late since July 2021.
 
3.    
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative asked for an order which would have the Tenants pay the rent on time for a twelve-month period. If the Tenants did not pay the rent on time and in full during this twelve-month
period then the Landlord could file with the Board for an eviction.




 
4.    
The parties
mutually agreed to resolve all matters at issue regarding
the N8 notice and requested
an order on consent.
 
Landlord’s Application-N5 Notice of Termination
 
5.    
On July 10, 2021,
the Landlord also served the Tenants an N5 Notice of Termination (N5) with a termination date of July 31, 2021, as the
Tenants have substantially
interfered with the lawful right or interest of the Landlord. This was the
first N5 notice served to the Tenants which allowed the Tenants to be able to
void the N5 notice if they corrected
their behaviour within 7 days of being served.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
that the Tenants
had accumulated
$3,996.49 in unpaid water/sewage service costs between
2019 and 2021 and that the
Landlord was forced to pay these bills to cover for the Tenants.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative asked
the Board for an order
for the Tenants
to pay the amount in full or
be evicted from the rental unit.
 
8.    
The Tenant’s
Legal Representative countered by requesting a ten (10) month repayment plan from the Board allowing the Tenants to remain in their home while being able to pay
back the Landlord.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
9.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
10.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay the Landlord the monthly rent due on or before
the 1st day of the month for the period of February
2022 to January 2023.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,996.49, which represents the unpaid
water/sewage service costs owing.
 
3.    
The Landlords’ application for eviction
of the Tenants is denied
on the condition that the Tenants shall make the following
payments to the Landlords in respect of the monies owing under paragraphs 1 and
2 of this order:
 
(a)  The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord nine (9)
payments of $400.00 monthly on or before the 10th day of the month commencing on February 10, 2022 to October 10, 2022.
 
(b)  The Tenants shall make a tenth payment
in the amount of $396.49 on or before November 10, 2022.




 
(c)  The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months
of February 2022 up
to and including January 2023 in full, on or before the first day of
each corresponding month.
 
4.    
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 3, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants,
and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already
ordered under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this order. The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 3 of
this order.
 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 2 of this order
shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the
post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
