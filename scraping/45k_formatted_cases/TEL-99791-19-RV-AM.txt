Amended Order under Section
126 Order under Section 21.2 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act
and the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
Amended Review Order
 
This
amended review order is issued to correct clerical original order issued on November 17, 2021.
The corrections have been bolded
and underlined for ease of reference in the order.
 
CLP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order permitting the rent charged to be increased
by more than the guideline
for one or more of the rental units
in the residential complex.
 
This application was resolved by written hearing
and order TEL-99791-19 was issued on February 18, 2021.
 
On March 17, 2021 tenant TB from
suite XXX (the ‘Tenant’) filed a request for review of this order on the grounds
of serious error and not being reasonably able to participate in the
hearing.
 
On March 25, 2021 the Board issued
an interim order directing this matter to a review hearing to determine whether
or not the Tenant was reasonably able to participate in the process. On March 30, 2021 the Landlord consented to granting of the Tenant’s
request for review.
 
On June 28, 2021 the
Board issued an interim order directing the matter to a new hearing and
extending the timelines for the written hearing to allow the Tenant to
provide written submissions. The Landlord had until July 7, 2021 to provide its
submissions, the Tenant had until August 2, 2021 to provide his submissions,
and the Landlord had until August 8, 2021 to reply. August 8, 2021 was a
Sunday, the Landlord filed his reply on August 9, 2021, and requested an
extension of time to file its reply if necessary. This request is granted as the deadline
of August 8, 2021 instead
of August 9, 2021 was set pursuant to a clerical error.
 
A written review hearing
was held.




It is determined that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord justified a rent increase
above the guideline
because of capital expenditures.
 
2.                 
The maximum rent increase
above the guideline
because of capital
expenditure is 2.02%.
 
3.                 
The Board received submissions
from the Tenant, TB. In his
submissions, the Tenant
raises maintenance issues
regarding his bathroom
tile and a leak it causes. The
Tenant also argues that other tenants allegedly have maintenance issues in
their units, such as broken fridges. Finally, the Tenant argues that there is a
two-tier maintenance system whereby the Landlord deliberately fails to maintain
older units in the residential complex. These submissions were taken into
consideration to the extent we can under the legislation.
 
4.                 
The Landlord submits it has maintained its obligations and fulfilled maintenance requests as required for any
unit that made such requests. The Landlord also submits that the Tenant
declined to file written maintenance requests.
 
5.                 
I
do not find that the Tenant proved that it is more likely than not the Landlord
deliberately neglects older units in the residential complex. These allegations
were speculative and unsupported by independent or documentary evidence.
 
6.                 
The Tenant’s submissions state
that this application should be dismissed because the Landlord failed to
maintain his unit along with some others contrary to s. 20(1) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). He argues that his bathroom needs to be
redone as the tile is broken and the bathroom leaks into the unit below. He also argues that other tenants have broken fridges and leaking AC
units. The allegations about his own unit are supported by photographs and audio recordings in which the Tenant speaks to Landlords’ agents and argues
with them about the necessity
of repairing the bathroom. The Tenant’s submissions acknowledge that the
Landlord made repairs to stop the leak but argues that this was a band aid
temporary solution.
 
7.                 
Based on the Tenant’s submission
and evidence filed, I find the maintenance issues raised by the Tenant do not rise to the level of a serious
breach as required by the Act and therefore cannot
be considered in an AGI application. The Tenant
has the right to file his own application with regard to these matters.
 
8.                 
The Board also received
a submission that any above guideline increase
awarded to the Landlord would pose a financial hardship on the tenants.
The Board is required to calculate any above guideline increase in accordance
with the
legislation and lacks the discretion to reduce the amount the landlord’s evidence justifies.
 
9.                 
The Tenant also filed a petition
apparently signed by 59 residents of the residential complex saying that they do not agree with the Landlord’s application.




In the column entitled “reason”
majority of the Tenants indicated “building security”, “loss of income”,
“repairs” or some combination thereof. I note that only the Tenant participated
in this hearing by making submissions to the
Board. Unfortunately, the Board cannot consider the petition. The questions
before the Board is whether the Landlord has met the conditions of s. 126 of
the Act for an above-guideline increase and in this case the Landlord has. As a result, the Board
must issue an order in favour of the Landlord.
 
10.             
The weighted useful life for the capital expenditures is 10 years.
 
11.             
The first effective date of the rent increase above the guideline is July 1, 2019.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord may increase
the rents charged by 2.02% for unit 1513.
 
2.                 
The percentage increase
set out in paragraph 1 is to be taken as follows:
a.      
The Landlord may increase
the rents charged
by 2.02% within
the time period of July 1,
2019 to June 30, 2020.
 
3.                 
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 1 may be taken in addition to the
annual guideline in effect on the increase date for the unit.
 
4.                 
The Landlord or the Tenants shall
pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order within 30
days.
 
5.                 
If the Tenants’ rent is increased
pursuant to the percentage increase ordered for capital expenditures and the same Tenant
remains in the unit after the expiration of the weighted useful life for capital
expenditures, then the rent
will be reduced.
 
6.                 
The annual guideline for 2019 is 1.8%
and for 2020 is 2.2%.
 
7.                 
The interim order issued on March 25, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order TEL-99791-19 issued on February 18, 2021
is lifted.
