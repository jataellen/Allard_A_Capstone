  matter of:


380 HIGHLAND ROAD FERGUS ON N1M3N8


 




Between:

and


 




 


Heather Wilson Mathieu Patenaude


Tenants



 
 
Mary Pat Hinton and John Barber (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Mathieu Patenaude and Heather Wilson (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
The Landlords and the Tenants attended the hearing.
It is determined that:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid $25,050.00 of the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from July 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 8, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Landlords incurred
costs of $186.00
for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
5.     The Landlords are holding a rent deposit
of $1,800.00.
 
6.     The parties agreed
that the amount
outstanding to February
28, 2022, inclusive
of rent arrears, and costs,
is $30,586.00.
 
7.     At the hearing,
the Landlords requested a standard order from the Board due to the excessive amount of rental arrears
owing.




File Number: SOL-25416-21
 
8.    
The Tenant, Mathieu Patinaude,
submitted that he had suffered some unfortunate setbacks over the past year but was now in a position to pay the rent moving
forward as well as be able to
pay back the Landlords the rent that was owing. The Tenant also proposed a very
satisfactory repayment plan which I have considered as part of this order.
 
9.    
The Landlords were reluctant at
first to accept the payment plan offer from the Tenants, however, they decided to try and recover the rental arrears
first as opposed
to having an order for eviction.
 
10.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be given.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay the Landlords
$30,586.00, which represents the arrears of rent
and costs outstanding for the period ending February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlords’ application for eviction of the Tenants
is denied on the condition
that:
 
(a) 
The Tenants shall pay installments of $3,000.00 on
or before the 15th of the month
for the ten (10) month period commencing February 15, 2022 to November
15, 2022.
 
(b) 
The remaining balance of $586.00 shall
be paid on or before
December 15, 2022.
 
(c) 
The Tenants shall pay the Landlords
the monthly rent for the months of March 2022 to
December 2022 in full and by the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.     If the Tenants
fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required then:
 
(a) 
The Landlords may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlords must make the application within
30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b) 
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
