Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-06540-19
 
 
 
 
 
TCHC (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict GOU(the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December
16, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, DM, and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant declined
the opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from September 1, 2019 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 4, 2019.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$179.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted
a rent ledger as evidence
which showed the rent arrears
in the amount of $358.00.
 
7.    
The Tenant testified that he disputed
that he owed $358.00 but did not submit any evidence to the Board to justify his
claim.




 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic upon the parties and whether the Landlord has attempted to negotiate a payment
plan, and find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction subject
to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. Although I find,
on a balance of probabilities, that the amount of arrears owed by the Tenant is
correct, I have determined that a payment plan would not be prejudicial to the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $533.00, which represents the arrears of rent ($358.00) and
costs ($175.00) outstanding for the period ending December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenants is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenants
shall make the following payments
to the Landlord in respect
of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  
The Tenants shall also
pay the Landlord the lawful rent for the months of January 2022 up to and including December 2022 in full, on or before
the first day of each
corresponding month.




 
3.    
If the Tenants fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)   The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenants, and for the payment of any new arrears of
rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance
owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
