File Number: EAT-87646-19
 
 



In the matter of:


320 KING
STREET WEST KINGSTON ON
  K7L2X1


 




Between:


Emma Jones


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Barbara Allinson


Landlord



 
 
 
Emma Jones
(the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Barbara Allinson (the 'Landlord') substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of
the Tenant's household (T2 Application).
 
AND
 
Emma Jones (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Barbara Allinson
(the 'Landlord’) Landlord
Gave a Notice of Termination in Bad Faith (T5 Application).
 
This application was heard via videoconference on October 20,
2021.
 
The Tenant and the Landlord
attended the hearing. Also, in attendance were the Tenant Representative, Ms. Naveera Bhutti,
and the Landlord
Representative, Mr. Greg Foss. The hearing commenced at 11:07 A.M.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.    The
Tenant alleges that she moved
out of the rental unit on
April 30, 2019 under pressure from the Landlord who stated
that she intended to repair or renovate the rental unit. However, the Landlord
re-rented the unit instead.
 
2.    The
Landlord Representative submitted
an Assignment of Lease with Consent of Landlord
(‘Assignment’) document, dated October 18, 2018. It was signed by the Tenant
and Ms. Rebecca Suggitt on October 23, 2018 and the former property owner, Mr.
Rod White, on October 28,2018.
 
3.    This
Assignment was scheduled to take effect
as of January 1, 2019 and stipulated that Rebecca Suggitt was to replace Emma Jones as an assignee
to the lease.




 
 
 
4.    The
Tenant's Legal Representative entered evidence emails between the former Landlord and Tenant dated October 26,
2018, indicating both parties had agreed not to proceed with the Assignment and
instead agreeing to make Rebecca Suggitt a Co-Tenant on the original lease
document. The former Landlord also advised that the new property owner, the
current Landlord, would be closing on the purchase November 2, 2018.
 
5.    The
Tenant's Legal Representative submitted the revised
lease at the hearing with initials
and signatures to that effect.
 
6.    I find that the Assignment of the
tenancy from Emma Jones to Rebecca
Suggitt was voided based on the emails between the Tenant and the former
Landlord, and accept
the modified lease agreement executed by the former Landlord and Ms.
Rebecca Suggitt adding her name to the lease as a Co-Tenant commencing January
1, 2019.
 
Tenant’s evidence
 
7.    The tenancy began on May 1, 2018 with
a total of four Tenants who all co-signed the Agreement to Lease on February 28, 2018,
including the applicant
Tenant Emma Jones.
 
8.    The
Tenant testified that she moved out of the rental unit
on April 30, 2019 because
the Landlord claimed that she intended to repair or renovate the rental
unit.
 
9.    However, the Landlord did not serve
the Tenant with a Notice to End
the Tenancy Because the Landlord Wants to Demolish the Rental Unit, Repair it
or Convert it to Another Use (N13)
pursuant to section
50(c) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) or pay the Tenant compensation
as required by section 54.
 
10. The Tenant also testified,
and it was confirmed later
in the hearing during the Landlord’s testimony, that the Landlord
had indicated her intention to move into the unit for herself personally. No N12 Termination for Landlord’s Own Use (s.48) was given to the Tenant.
 
11. Additionally, the Tenant
testified that no building permits
were provided to the Tenant and
that she had corresponded with the Landlord on Dec. 4, 2018, indicating she
wanted to exercise her first right of refusal request to move back into the
rental unit following any renovations.
 
12. Further to this, the Tenant submitted correspondence
from December 5, 2018 with the new Landlord that informed her that a rent increase
of 8.6% from $737.00 monthly
rent to
$800.00 would be required
if the Tenant was to continue month-to-month in the rental unit at the end of the term of the
lease.




 
13. The Tenant’s Legal Representative submitted additional
emails from the Landlord to Ms. Suggitt on April 27, 2019 indicating the Landlord had an agreement
to lease the rental unit
to another group of tenants commencing in September 2019 and that they were leaving
their luggage in the rental unit. In the same series of emails, the Landlord
referenced that she had given Ms. Suggitt a notice of this three weeks prior to
April 27, 2019.
 
14. The Tenant
moved into a comparable new rental
unit on May 1, 2019 at
a monthly rent of
$1290.00. The
Tenant provided evidence that the new rental unit lease agreement was secured on March 5, 2019, as she believed
at the time she had no other option,
in spite of having attempt to advise the Landlord that she had intended
to stay on as a Tenant, and was attempting to bring in some new co-tenants as
part of the lease agreement.
 
 
Landlord’s
evidence
 
15. With respect to whether the Tenant was pressured to move out, the Landlord
testified that the former
Landlord, Mr. White, indicated to her that it was the Tenant’s intention to
terminate the tenancy at the end of the lease term.
 
16. The Landlord testified
further, that had she known
that the termination of the tenancy
was going to be contested by the Tenant, she would not have responded to
the Tenant as nicely as she did, in her opinion.
 
17. The Landlord also testified that she was not familiar
with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the
Act’) and that she seldom had dealings with tenant matters, despite the fact
she has an interest in a number of other rental properties with her family
members.
 
18. The Landlord also testified about the extent
of renovations to the property, the significant
costs involved, and specifically emphasized that most of the costly work was
exterior landscaping related, with some cosmetic changes planned for inside the
residence.
 
Analysis
 
19. I find that the Landlord improperly pressured the
Tenant to terminate the tenancy and move out of the rental unit based on the
correspondence between the parties, and oral testimony provided by both the Tenant and the Landlord. In the Landlord’s oral testimony,
the Landlord was dismissive of her obligations under the Act, and proceeded to
contend that she thought the previous owner had done all the necessary due
diligence in relation to this Tenancy, and did not hold herself accountable in
any way.
 
20. Additionally, the fact that the Landlord did not give the Tenant
any Notices of Termination as required by the Act, along
with the Landlord’s email evidence which references the




 
prospect of an illegal
rent increase, clearly
demonstrated her lack of regard
for the Act’s requirements.
 
21. While the timing of the sale of the property may have
impacted on communication between the purchaser and seller, there is no
evidence to suggest that the Tenant had any
intention of moving out of the unit or terminating the tenancy
prior to being told by the
Landlord that she had to move out so the Landlord could renovate the unit. In
her testimony, the Landlord attempted to attribute her belief that the Tenant
intended to terminate the tenancy based on interactions she believed the Tenant
had with the previous Landlord, but offered no credible, direct evidence
establishing that the Tenant had ever given the prior Landlord a notice to
terminate the tenancy. Regardless, the fact that the Landlord may have believed
that the Tenant had told the former owner that she wanted to end the tenancy does not absolve
the Landlord of her responsibilities under the Act.
 
22. Further to this, based on the Landlord’s testimony, although her intentions may have been to move into the upper level, she
also stated that she already had a new group of tenants expected to move into the rental
unit in September, and that she
was already familiar with them from another property owned by the
Landlord. This evidence suggests that the Landlord had every intention of
terminating the tenancy with Ms. Jones for the purpose of re-renting the unit
for a higher rent.
 
23. I therefore find on the balance of probabilities
the Landlord substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant by improperly pressuring her to terminate
the tenancy and vacate the rental unit.
Remedy:
 
24. The Tenant testified
that she had incurred
direct costs because of having
to vacate the unit and is seeking the following:
•        
Moving costs in the amount
of $470.00,
•        
a
bed replacement amount
of $135.00,
•        
a
rent differential amount of $651.00
(12 months @ $54.33),
•        
rent abatement in the amount of $2948.00 (100% for a period of 4 months),
and
•        
$900.00 in lost wages.
 
There are corresponding receipts
for all the items requested
and employer correspondence
confirming lost wages in the amount of $136.00.
 
25. I find that the out-of-pocket costs and rent
differential claimed by the Tenant are all reasonable and warranted as they were incurred as a direct
result of the Tenant having to move out of
the rental unit. With respect to the requested rent abatement, I find that the




 
Landlord’s pressure
on the Tenant to terminate the tenancy impacted
the Tenant’s enjoyment of the
unit in the final four months of the tenancy and warrants a rent abatement of
$1000 in total for period from January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2019
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant a rent abatement of $1000.00.
 
2.    The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant
the amount of $651.00. This amount represents all the increased rent that the Tenant has incurred from May 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020.
 
3.    The
Landlord shall pay to the Tenant $470.00,
for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
that the Tenant has incurred related to moving expenses.
 
4.   
The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant $136.00
in lost wages.
 
5.   
The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenant
$50.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.   
The total amount the Landlord owes the Tenant is
$2,307.00.
 
7.   
The Landlord shall pay the Tenant
the full amount
owing by February
5, 2022.
 
8.    If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by February 5, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated February 6, 2022, at 2.00%
annually on the outstanding balance.
 
9.    The
Tenant has the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
