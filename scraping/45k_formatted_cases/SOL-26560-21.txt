In the
  matter of:


UNIT#1 (UPPER), 740
ARVIN AVENUE STONEY CREEK
  ON L8E5N1


 




Between:


Gino Yachetti


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Brian Tessier


Tenant



 
On November 17, 2021, Gino
Yachetti (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Brian Tessier (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on November 2, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-23671-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,100.00 on or before November
13, 2021 towards rent. The Tenant paid $800.00.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $186.00
for the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order SOL-23671-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $186.00 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order SOL-23671-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-23671-21 is cancelled.




File Number: SOL-26560-21
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00.
This amount represents the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
January 21, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 21, 2022, then starting
January 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.

The tenant has until January 20, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 20, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 22, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
