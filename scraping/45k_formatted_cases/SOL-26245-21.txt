Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26245-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


101, 10 GLENBROOK DRIVE GUELPH ON N1E1A9


 




Between:


Rovicorp Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Van Roon


Tenant



 
 
 
Rovicorp Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amanda Van
Roon (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rentThe Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on February 9, 2022.
The Landlord’s Agent, Ronald Yloothius and the Tenant attended the hearing. Determinations:
1.     The N8 Notice contained a typographical error which
did not confuse the Tenant. The Notice substantially complies
with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and is sufficient respecting contents of the form.
 
2.     The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Tenant works in a restaurant and her hours were reduced. The Tenant made no
payments towards rent after the N8 Notice was issued on November 22, 2021. As
such, also December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022 rent payments were
late. The Tenant indicated she’s
working two full time jobs that allegedly started either one or two weeks.
There wasn’t enough evidence to corroborate her claim.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 26, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 26, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26245-21
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 26, 2022, then starting February
27, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 27, 2022.
