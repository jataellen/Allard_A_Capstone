Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-20936-21-EX
 
 



In the matter
of:


15 CALE AVENUE COURTICE ON L1E0H5


 




Between:


Pirathapan Muruguppillai


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sheriza
  Mohamed


Tenant



 
 
 
Pirathapan
Muruguppillai (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sheriza Mohamed (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on September 24, 2021 with respect to
application HOL-08950-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay $608.33
towards the arrears on or before October
20, 2021. The Tenant failed to pay the
full lawful monthly rent in full on or before
November 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $7,486.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's
application fee in Order HOL-08950-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $7,486.00
and that amount is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order HOL-08950-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,400.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020. There is no further interest owing since
there was no guideline rent increase allowed (consequently no interest) in 2021
due to COVID19.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order HOL-08950-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord $8,021.67*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 4, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to
the Landlord $78.90 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting
January 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.

s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
