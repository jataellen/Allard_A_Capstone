Review Order
 
Valiant Rental Properties Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Colin Davidson and Kathleen
Davidson (the 'Tenants') to pay compensation for the damages
caused by them or
a person they permitted in the residential complex.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-10784-20 issued on June 16, 2021. On July 16, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative C. Aylwin attended the hearing. As of 9:24 a.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Garett Wood (GW) testified
on behalf of the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based
on the ground of serious
error.
 
2.     The order under
review results from a hearing
that took place on June 1, 2021.
Both parties attended.
 
3.     The order under
review dismisses the Landlord’s application on the basis that the damage claimed by the Landlord is to elements
of the rental unit that are old. The




 
Member reasoned that these
elements would need replacing in any event because of their age (relying on s.27(1) of Ontario Regulation 516/06) and so it would
not be fair to the Tenants
to order them to pay for the repair of these elements.
 
4.     At the review hearing (as at the original hearing),
the Landlord’s property manager GW testified that the floors in the building
are high quality hardwood parquet and all that is normally required to bring
them to a suitable condition in between tenancies is sanding and refinishing.
These floors are several decades old but as long as they are not damaged by
more than wear and tear they can last a very long time with only being
refinished. In this case the damage was so extensive throughout the unit that
the only option was to replace the floors. The Landlord opted to replace the
hardwood parquet with less expensive laminate parquet at a cost of $3,650.72. GW testified that the cost to
refinish the floors instead would have been around $500.00 or $600.00.
 
5.    
There is no indication in the order that the Member considered the quality of the floors. The Member accepted the Landlord’s evidence and submissions that the Tenants had caused damage to
the floors throughout the unit by allowing a cat to urinate on them.
 
6.     I find that it was a serious error to dismiss the
claim with respect to the damage to the floors. The Landlord established that
the Tenants did damage the floors such that the floors had to be replaced. Because
of this damage, the Landlord
lost the option to refinish the floors and was forced to
replace them. It is unfair to require the Landlord to absorb this entire cost
under these circumstances. It was unreasonable to find that, due to their age,
the floors would have required replacing in any event, especially in the face
of evidence to the contrary.
 
7.     The appropriate remedy for this error is to cancel and
replace the original order with an order requiring the Tenants to pay the difference between
the cost of refinishing and the
cost of replacing the floors. The Landlord would be unjustly enriched if their
normal turnover cost of refinishing the floors was to be paid by the Tenants.
The difference in these amounts is $3,050.72.
 
8.     The Landlord gave no evidence with respect to the other elements that form
part of the review request. The
argument that was successful with respect to the floors would not have been nearly as persuasive with respect to appliances or kitchen cupboards in any event.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TEL-10784-20 issued
on June 16, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the following:
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,050.72, which represents the reasonable
costs of replacing the damaged property.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
4.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 28, 2022, they will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
