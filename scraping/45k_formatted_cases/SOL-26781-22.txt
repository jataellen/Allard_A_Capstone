On January 5, 2022, Lloyd George Wood (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Carol Anne Thibedault (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to
terminate the tenancy as of December 31, 2021 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination
date set out in the agreement.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
