and


 




 


Michelle Pamarang


Tenant



 
East Briar Towers Limited
c/o Brialane Rental Property Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Michelle Pamarang (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on November
25, 2021.
The Landlord's Legal Representative David
Ciobotaru and the Tenant attended
the hearing. The Tenant spoke
with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
Determinations:
1.    
The residential complex is a four (4) storey
multi unit apartment building.
2.    
On January 19, 2021 the Landlord
filed the application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenants based on two (N5 form) notices
for termination given to the Tenant.
3.    
The Tenant has lived
in the residential complex since 2014.
4.    
The first N5 notice was given
to the Tenant on January 4, 2021, alleging
the Landlord has received a
complaint that the Tenant on January 4, 2021 was making loud banging noise and
what was dragging something heavy believed to be furniture across the floor of
the rental unit at approximately 2:10 am and that the noise continued for
approximately 20 minutes.
5.    
Subsection 64(1) of the Act
states: A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant(s), another
occupant of the rental unit or a person
permitted in the residential complex
by the tenant(s) is such
that it substantially interferes
with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right,
privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.




 
 
6.    
Section 64(3) of the
Residential Tenancies Act 2006, (the
‘Act’) provides that the type of N5 Notice served by the Landlord is
void if the Tenant, within seven (7) days after receiving the notice stops
the activity or corrects the conduct/behaviour. In this case, the
N5 was served on January 4, 2021, which means the seven (7) day voiding period
ran from January 5, 2021 to January 11, 2021.
 
7.    
The Landlord provided copies of emails
received from a neighbouring Tenant (Unit#414) that excessive noise was first
heard on December
30, 2020, then on January
4, 2021, on January 7, 2021, January 11, 2021 and
again on January 17, 2021.
 
8.     I find the Tenant did not
void the first N5 notice.
 
9.    
Pursuant to section 68 of the Act,
before serving a second N5 notice of termination the Landlord must have
previously been given a valid first notice of termination with an opportunity to void the notice within 7 days of it being given. It is only if this first notice is given and the conduct
resumes or a situation
arises that constitutes grounds for a notice
of termination within six months after the first notice was given that a
non-voidable N5 notice can be served.
 
10.  A second (N5) notice was given to the Tenants on
January 18, 2021 for further complaints that the Landlord received
from other tenants
in the residential complex
of noise emanating from the Unit #416.
 
11.  The Tenant submitted copy of a joint letter received
from Tenants’ in units #412, and #417 lodging a harassment complaint towards the landlord’ witness Tenant from #414.
 
12.  The Tenant refutes the allegations being made by the
Tenant from #414 and submitted photographs taken within her apartment illustrating the type of furniture she has citing
the difficulty it would be to drag such furnishings across the unit
floor.
 
13.  All in all, I’m faced with a he said, she said
dilemma.
 
14.  Since this is the Landlord’s application, the Landlord
bears the burden
of proving the allegations on a balance of
probabilities.
 
15. 
The standard
of proof requires
that evidence “must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy
the balance of probabilities test.”
 
16. 
On any application, but especially on an application like this, a landlord cannot
simply make general allegations against a tenant and expect termination
of the tenancy to follow. A termination of a tenancy must always be a remedy of
last resort.
 
17.  In my view, based on the totality of the testimonies
given and the documentation presented, all the necessary elements
of the alleged offence have not been made out in
this case.




 
18.  All in all, I was not satisfied the Landlord’s evidence
is insufficient to rise to the level necessary to meet the Landlords’ burden
of proof to warrant to end the tenancy.
 
19.  The Landlord’s application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenant is to be dismissed.
 
20.  This order contains
all the reason for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Landlord's application is dismissed without
prejudice.
