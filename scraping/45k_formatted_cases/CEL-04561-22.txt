On November 1, 2021, Real Property
Management Services (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andrea Perez and Yoalmo
Molina (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they
owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on March 18, 2021 with respect to application CEL- 93282-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord filed
the application more than 30 days after
the Tenant failed
to meet the condition specified in the Order.
 
2.     Order CEL-93282-20 sets out a payment plan, which
required the Tenants to make payments toward arrears over a period ending October 1, 2023, and that
the Tenants pay rent in full or on time. The Order
also included a provision that if the Tenants breached these provisions, the
Landlord could apply to the Board, under section 78 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
for
an eviction order without notice to the Tenant.
 
3.     Subsection 78(5) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the “Act”) requires that any application made under section
78 be made not later than 30 days after the failure
of a tenant to meet any such
condition in the previous order.
 
4.     The Landlord filed this L4 Application on November 1, 2021. In the Declaration that was filed with
the application, the Landlord states that contrary to order CEL-93282-20 the
Tenants failed to made payment of rent and arrears on October 1, 2021. No other ground for breach was sated in
the application.




File Number: CEL-04561-22
 
5.    
November 1, 2021 is 31 days after
October 1, 2021. More than 30 days
had passed since the Tenants’
alleged breach before the application was brought. Therefore, this L4 Application
is statute-barred by limitation.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application under section 78 of the Act is dismissed.
 
2.     Order CEL-93282-20, issued
on March 18, 2021 remains
in effect.
