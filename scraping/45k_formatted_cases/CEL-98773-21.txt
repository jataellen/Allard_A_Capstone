and


 




 


Tricia Brown Wayne
Green


Tenants



 
 
 
99 Agnes Holdings Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wayne Green
and Tricia Brown (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on October 25, 2021. The Landlord and the Landlord’s legal
representative, Howard Levenson,
attended the hearing.
The Tenants’ daughter Rachel Brown (‘RB’) attended the
hearing on behalf of the Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,095.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,095.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to February 19, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenants paid $14,665.00 after
the application was filed but before the hearing was held. Any payments made by the Tenants after October 25, 2021 are not included
in this amount.




 
7.    
Parties agreed that as of the date of the hearing
the arrears of rent owing to the Landlord
to the end of October 2021 were $4,190.00.
 
Filing Fee
 
8.     The Landlord incurred
the cost of $186.00 in filing this application and is entitled
to a reimbursement of this
cost.
 
9.     At the hearing
the Tenants requested that the fee be waived because the Tenants fell into
arrears of rent due to medical conditions and because they had informed the
Landlord that rent would be paid late for medical reasons.
 
10.  The Tenants did not dispute
that they were in arrears
of rent when this application was filed nor did they dispute that they were still in arrears
of rent as of the date of the hearing.
 
11.  It is the Board’s normal
practice to award
a landlord its costs of filing an application for arrears of rent in any situation
where the tenant was in arrears as of the date the application was filed. This practice is informed by the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act), the Board’s Rules of Practice and the Interpretation
Guidelines.
 
12.  Subsection 204(2) of the Act states, “The Board may
order a party to an application to pay the costs
of another party.”
This provision provides
the Board discretionary power to order a
party to pay costs.
 
13.  However, in the context of an application for arrears
of rent, subsection 74(2) is instructive. This provision says that if a tenant
pays all of the rent owing and the landlord’s application fee, then an arrears
application is “discontinued”. This provision supports the conclusion that it is the normal
expectation that in arrears
situations a tenant will be required to reimburse the
landlord its cost of filing the application.
 
14.  The Board’s Interpretation Guideline #3 entitled
“Costs” states: “In most cases, the only costs allowed will be the application
fee. This should be ordered if the applicant is successful in obtaining an order which
allows the relief
they asked for in the application, or substantially all of that
relief.”
 
15.  Similarly, Rule 27.1 of the Board’s Rules of Practice
states, “If the applicant is successful,
the LTB may order the respondent to pay the application fee to the applicant as
‘costs’”.
 
16.  Given the above, it appears that the Board is expected
to award a landlord its costs of filing a non-payment of rent application where
the tenant is found to be in arrears as of the date the application was filed.
The parties did not dispute that this is the situation in the case before me.
The circumstances of this case are not such that would warrant departing from
the Board’s standard practice. While I sympathize with the Tenants’
circumstances, they are not unique and they are not such that would allow them
to not pay their rent. The Landlord
was therefore entitled
to file their application and the Tenant is ordered to pay the $186.00
application fee the Landlord incurred.




 
Relief from eviction
 
17.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), including the
impact of Covid-19 on the
parties and whether or not the Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment
agreement with the Tenants,
and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject
to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
18.  The Tenants requested a payment plan whereby they
would pay regular monthly rent plus $300.00 a month towards arrears of rent on
or before the 15th of every month until the arrears of rent are paid off. The first payment
would be made no later
than November 15, 2021. In
response to a question about the Tenants’ ability to pay the Tenants improved
their proposal to $600 a month towards arrears of rent.
 
19.  The Tenants’ evidence
was that their income was affected by their health issues and that
there are 5 occupants at the rental unit – the Tenants and their 3 children
aged 4, 8 and
20.  Their income was starting to increase as the female
Tenant was going back to work.
 
20.  
The Landlord did
not consent to the Tenants’ proposal of $600.00 a month towards arrears of rent but did not object to it. The Landlord objected
to the payment date of 15th of every month, however, as it would
represent a departure from the lease agreement which stipulated that rent would
be paid on the first of every month.
 
21.   I have considered all of the circumstances and find
that it would not be unfair to substantially grant the Tenants’ request subject
to some modifications. First, given the date of issuance of this order the
Tenants will have until February 15th, 2022 to
make all of the payments they would have had to make by that date under their
proposed plan. Second, they will have to pay rent on the first of every month
as required by their lease starting March 1, 2022. They will have to make the
additional payment of $600 a month on or before the first of every month
starting April 1, 2022. This will give the Tenants additional time to organize
their affairs but will not permanently change
the agreement the parties reached regarding the date on
which the rent is due.
 
22.  
I
am substantially granting
the Tenants’ request
for a payment plan because
they have made good faith
efforts to pay the arrears of rent, and because they have two minor children
living with them. While I am concerned that the Tenants did not attend the
hearing to provide direct testimony about their medical and financial
circumstances, I found RB’s evidence to be generally credible and I accept that
the proposed payment plan is fair and that the Tenants are able to comply with
the proposed plan.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$4,376.00, which represents the arrears of rent
and costs outstanding for the period ending October 31, 2021.




 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for
eviction of the Tenants is denied on
the condition that the Tenants pay to the Landlord
the following amounts
in respect of the monies
owing under paragraph 1 of
this order:
 
(a)  
$2,400.00 on or before
February 15, 2022.
Any payments towards
arrears of rent made after October 25, 2021 shall be
subtracted from this amount;
 
(b)  
$600.00 on or before
March 15, 2022;
 
(c)  
$600.00 on or before
the 1st of every month for 2 months
starting April 1, 2022 and ending on May 1, 2022; and
 
(d)  
$176.00 on or before
June 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay the Landlord $8,380.00
representing rent for the months
of November 2021, December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022 on or
before February 15, 2022. Any payments towards rent for these months already made by the Tenants after October 25, 2021
shall be subtracted from this amount.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord the rent for the months of
March 2022 to June 2022 in
full, and on or before the first of each corresponding month.
 
5.     If the Tenants
fail to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 or 4
of this order, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an
order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of
any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make an application within 30 days of
a breach of a condition set out in paragraphs 2, 3 or 4 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default.
The monies owing shall bear interest at the post- judgment interest rate determined
under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
