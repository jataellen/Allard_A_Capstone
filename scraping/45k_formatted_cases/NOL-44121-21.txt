In the
  matter of:


204, 166 LOUIS
STREET SUDBURY ON P3B2H3


 




Between:


Greater Sudbury Housing
  Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Owen Brohart


Tenant



 
 
 
Greater Sudbury
Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Owen Brohart (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Francine MacMillan attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On September 13, 2021 a
guest of The Tenant’s was captured on video surveillance laying on the floor in the hallway kicking
and causing damage including holes in the wall.
The cost to repair the damage was $650.00. Later
that same day, the Tenant’s guest threatened another tenant who resides in the
residential complex.
 
2.    
I find a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant caused damage and substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
 
3.    
Considering the fact it was guest of the Tenant’s who committed these acts, I find it appropriate to grant relief from
eviction with conditions.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant, an occupant
of the rental unit or any person the Tenant permits into the residential complex
shall not substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant for the next twelve consecutive months.




File Number: NOL-44121-21
 
2.    
In the event the Tenant fails to comply
with the conditions as set out in paragraph 1 of the order, the Landlord shall be entitled
to apply to the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this Order,
without notice to the Tenant, for an Order terminating the tenancy and evicting
the Tenant, pursuant to Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
