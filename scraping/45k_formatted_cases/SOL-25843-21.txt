Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25843-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 211
WEST AVENUE NORTH HAMILTON ON L8L5C7


 




Between:


Steve Berry


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Collette Arnott


Tenant



 
 
 
Steve Berry (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Collette
Arnott (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 12, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
 
1.      For the reasons
that follow, I find that the Landlord‘s application is dismissed.
 
2.     
The rental unit is a duplex
with the Tenant’s one bedroom
rental unit in the basement while the other rental unit in
the duplex is on the main and upper floors, is four bedrooms and is currently
rented to a family.    The Tenant has resided in the rental unit since October
1, 2017 and pays $500.00 per month in rent.
 
3.     
Along with the Landlords’ L2 application, an N12 notice
of termination, certificate of service, declaration and Schedule B were completed and
attached.
 
4.     
On June 26, 2021 the Landlord
served an N12 notice of termination on the Tenant. The N12 notice of termination states
that the Landlord’s son intends to move into the rental
unit and occupy it for at least one year. The N12 notice of termination sought possession of the rental
unit for August 31, 2021.




 
5.     
The Tenant testified that her
address on the N12 notice of termination is incorrect as it states “211 West Avenue
North Hamilton Ontario
L8L 5C7” and her rental unit is identified as “basement”.            The
N12 notice of termination does not specify any rental unit. The Tenant produced copies of
correspondence from her bank and from a utility company that show her address
as “211 West Avenue North, Basement, Hamilton, Ontario L8L 5C7”.
 
6.     
The N12 notice of termination does not clearly
identify any rental
unit, rather it states “211 West Avenue North Hamilton Ontario
L8L 5C7”.
 
7.     
The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) does not take a relaxed
or loose approach to the identification of rental
units in notices of termination such as the N12 notice of termination at issue
here. Subsection 43(1) of the Act sets out the minimum requirements for
a notice of termination of a tenancy:
 
Where this Act permits
a landlord or tenant to give a notice of termination, the notice
shall be in a form approved by the Board and shall,
 
(a)  
identify the rental unit for which the notice is given; [emphasis added]
 
(b)  
state the date on which the tenancy is to terminate; and
 
(c)    
be signed by the person giving the notice,
or the person's agent
 
 
8.     
It is clear, and undisputed, that
when the Tenant was served with the N12 notice of termination, there were two
tenancies in the complex – one involving the Tenant in the basement and the
other involving another Tenant on the main and upper floors. The basement Tenant, given the evidence provided, receives at least some mail identifying her unit as “basement”.
 
9.     
I find that the correct identification
of the rental unit is a clear
and unequivocal requirement of the
legislation. The Landlord’s N12 notice of termination does not comply with
subsection 43(1) of the Act as the address of the rental unit was not
correctly identified. The N12 notice of termination does not specify the exact
rental unit therefore the N12 notice of termination is defective. The Landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy cannot be granted without a valid
notice of termination.




 
 
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
 
February 8, 2022
Date Issued
 
Southern-RO
119 King Street West,
6th Floor Hamilton ON L8P4Y7
