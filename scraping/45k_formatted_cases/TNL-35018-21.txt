the rental unit on November

possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,204.08.
 
4.

is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
6.    
The Tenant paid $1,289.00
after the application was filed.

The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,103.11*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit.

for the cost of filing the application.

owing* on or before February
