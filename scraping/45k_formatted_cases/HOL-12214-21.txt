Vasiliki Ouzounis


 
Tenant



 
 
Baytree Property Management Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Vasiliki Ouzounis (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on January 26, 2022.
 
Only the
Landlord's Legal Representative, Shannon Jackson, attended the hearing. As of
1:41 p.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,500.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application
was filed.
 
5.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
