Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-73575-18
 











 



 


 


 



 
 

M S (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict S C and S C (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants because: 
a)    they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted
in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and 
b)    they have been persistently late in paying their rent. 
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 Application).
 
This application was heard in Mississauga on March 1,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord's
Legal Representative, K. L attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
Regarding L1 rent owing
application
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2017 to
March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 6, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,650.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 1, 2016 to February 6,
2018.
 
NSF charges
4.     
The Landlord claimed NSF
charges at the hearing.  The Landlord's Legal Representative requested an
amendment to the L1 application to include $100.00 representing NSF charges
incurred.
5.     
The L1 application was not
amended and served to the Tenants as provided for by Board rule 16.  The
Tenants were not present to provide a response to the request for an amendment.
6.     
This claim is denied. The
NSF charges were incurred prior to February 13, 2018 when the application was
filed with the Board.  The Landlord did not provide any reasons why he did not
include these charges in the L1 application when it was filed.  The Landlord's
Legal Representative indicated that $100 was claimed for NSF charges and
submitted copies of 4 cheques which were returned to the Landlord. The Landlord
did not specify the amount of bank charges and administration charges claimed. 
There is no information on the submitted cheques regarding any bank charges. Even
if I were to grant the amendment, the Landlord did not provide the required
details regarding NSF charges incurred.  The Landlord did not provide the amounts
claimed for bank and administration charges in either the L1 application or
L1/L9 update form.
Regarding L2 Application
Persistent late rent
7.     
On January 9, 2018 the
Landlord gave the Tenants an N8 notice of termination pursuant to subsection
58(1)(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (the 'Act').  The notice
is effective March 31, 2018 and alleges that the Tenants persistently paid rent
late.
8.     
The Tenants have
persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. 
9.     
Rent is due on the first day
of each month. The Tenants paid rent late 12 times out of the last 15 months. 
The Landlord submitted a copy of the tenancy agreement and rent ledger to
support the late payment dates.
Substantial interference 
10.  
On January 22, 2018 the
Landlord gave the Tenants an N5 notice of termination pursuant to subsection
64(1) of the Act.  The notice alleges that the conduct of the Tenants
substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment or a lawful right of the
Landlord.
11.  
This N5 notice did not become void because the
Tenants did not correct the problem within the 7 day time period set out in the
notice.
12.  
The rental unit is a
condominium unit.
13.  
The Tenants substantially
interfered with a lawful right of the Landlord by allowing an unauthorized and unlicensed
vehicle to occupy the parking spot assigned to the unit.  As well, the vehicle
is leaking oil in the parking spot.  The Landlord has been given two notices of
violation from the condominium security company which he submitted. These
notices indicate that the vehicle may be tagged or towed and it is probable
that the Landlord would be liable for payment of these costs by the condominium
corporation.
14.  
The Landlord did not provide
sufficient evidence to demonstrate substantial interference regarding his
testimony that the Tenants are renting out the unit through airbnb.  The
Landlord directed me to a clause in the tenancy agreement which states that the
Tenants agreed not to sublease the unit without the consent of the Landlord. 
The Act contains provisions regarding subletting a unit.  The Board A2 application
form relates to sublet of a unit. The Landlord relies on section 64 of the Act
in this application, not on the sublet provisions.  Furthermore, the Landlord
did not provide evidence regarding the condominium bylaws that are contravened
because the Tenants are renting out the unit through airbnb or the impact to
the Landlord of any such contravention.  Merely mentioning the condominium
bylaws in the N5 notice is not sufficient to support the allegations in the
notice.
Relief from eviction
15.  
The Landlord seeks final
termination of the tenancy as of March 31, 2018.
16.  
No circumstances were
disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, to consider relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,305.44*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to March 7, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $54.25 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting March 8, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 31, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from April
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2018.
