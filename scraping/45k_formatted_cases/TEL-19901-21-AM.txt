This
amended order is issued to correct clerical errors in the original order. More
specifically, the order is being amended to remove minors who were identified as parties
in the order and to correct who attended the hearing. The corrections have been
bolded and underlined for ease of reference.
 
Yin Ying Wang and Ricky Wen Yue
Li (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Lisa Rachel Manwarren and Tyran
Nicholson (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe. The Landlords also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on January 19, 2022. The
Landlord Yin Ying Wang, the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Honghui Zhou, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 30, 2021.
 
2.   
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.   
The lawful monthly rent is $2,780.00.
 
4.   
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.




File Number: TEL-19901-21-AM
 
5.   
The Landlords incurred charges
of $49.00 for cheques tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenants, which were
returned NSF and $140.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.   
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,780.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlords.
 
7.   
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 16, 2021 to
September 30, 2021.
 
8.   
The Tenants disputed the amount of
the arrears stating that they made additional payments after the application
was filed. the Tenants did not provide any documentation to support this assertion
prior to the hearing. The Tenants wanted to submit additional documentation to support their assertion at the hearing.
I denied the Tenants' request as it was contrary
to Rule 19. I also did not find it appropriate to exercise my authority under
Rule 1.6 to waive Rule 19.
 
9.   
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants
and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants requested relief from eviction in the form of
a payment plan which would have the arrears paid off in 10 months. The
Landlord was opposed to the payment plan. I found that it would be unfair to
grant the relief requested by the Tenants given the amount of arrears, the
short duration of the tenancy (commencing July 16, 2021), the fact that the
arrears began to accumulate in the first full month of the tenancy (August
2021), and that no payments have been made since October 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $13,580.01*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 27, 2022 and the total charges related to
NSF cheques tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenants, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $91.40 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
7, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 8, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 7, 2022, then starting February
8, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 8, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$14,010.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$16,790.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 7, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
