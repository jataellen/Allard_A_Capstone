Tenants



 
 
 
Tripat Homes Inc. c/o Stephanie
Tripp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tony Davis Aka. Anthony Davis
and Gail Davis (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 20, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Kira Passell, attended the hearing. As of 10:02 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on
November 23, 2021, as the result of the Sheriff enforcing SWL-53596-21 previously
issued by the Board. The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $600.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
23, 2021, the date the Sheriff returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord through enforcement
of SWL-53596-21.

owing and compensation up to November 23, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
10, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 11, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
