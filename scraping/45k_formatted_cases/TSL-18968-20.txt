Amelin Property Management (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Swann Poirier (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard via video conference on June 16,
2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative, Tiffany Raymond,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from November 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective November 21, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant moved out of the rental unit on September
30, 2021.
 
3.    
The arrears of rent owing for the period
ending September 30, 2021, total
$18,485.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord incurred costs
as a result of filing
the application in the amount
of $186.00 and is entitled to be reimbursed for those costs
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,925.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from September 1, 2020
to November 21, 2020, in the amount of $9.51.
 
7.    
The Tenant paid $2,690.00 after the application was filed.

As the Tenant has vacated the rental unit,
the Landlord is seeking an order
only for the outstanding arrears. An order will issue accordingly.
