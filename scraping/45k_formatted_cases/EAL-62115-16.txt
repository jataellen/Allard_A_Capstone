Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-62115-16
 










 




In
  the matter of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


PPM


Landlord




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


VM


Tenant




 


 


 



 
 
PPM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict VM (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L-1
application\N-4 notice).
 
And
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because she has been persistently late in paying her rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
 
These
applications were heard together in Ottawa on February 1, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Mr. AK attended the
hearing. As of 1:30 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
In accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, I canvassed the Landlord’s Legal Representative as to
whether there are any circumstances in this case that would cause me to
consider granting relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Landlord’s Legal Representative was open to the possibility of the Tenant
preserving her tenancy if the Tenant can void the L-1 portion of the
application as set out in the order and pay her rent on or before the first day
of each month for the next twelve months.
 


 
Determinations:
 
L-1
application/N-4 notice
1.    The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 19, 2016.
2.   
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.   
The monthly rent is $1,252.49.
 
4.   
The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,199.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
6.    Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2013 to
December 19, 2016.
7.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L-2
application/N-8 notice
8.    The
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
9.    I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
L-1
application/N-4 notice
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 18, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,574.22*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 7, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $41.18 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 8, 2017 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 18, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 19, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 18, 2017, then starting February
19, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 19,
2017.
8.      If,
on or before February 18, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,927.47** to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust, the L-1 portion of this order for
eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and
on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the L-1 portion of this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after February 19, 2017 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L-2
application/N-8 notice
10.   In
the event that the Tenant complies with the requirements in paragraph # 8 or
paragraph # 9 she may continue the tenancy as long as she pays the lawful
monthly rent on or before the first day of each month for the next twelve
months starting March 2017 through to and including February 2018.
11.   In
the event that the Tenant fails to make any of the payments referred to in
paragraph # 10 in full and on time, the Landlord shall be entitled to apply to
the Board, no later than 30 days after a breach of this order, without notice
to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and
for any arrears that have become due after the date of this order, pursuant to
Section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006.
