468 Ottawa
North Residences Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sufian Nineza and Ahmed Ismail Noor (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January
11, 2022. The Landlord’s representative, Ann Skelley,
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Tenants have not paid the total
rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.     As of January
1, 2022 the monthly rent for the unit is
$1,011.74.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid all arrears for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application was
filed.
 
6.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
7.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to January 31, 2022 is
$186.00.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.

Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest

2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
