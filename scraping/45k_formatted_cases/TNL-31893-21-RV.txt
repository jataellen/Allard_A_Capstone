Review Order
 
 
Ben Mehdizadeh (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Farzad Esmizadeh (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to
the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant
to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was resolved by order TNL-31893-21 issued on August
23, 2021. On September 7,
2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard on February 17, 2022. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. The Tenant also did not attend
the hearing on August 19, 2021.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord did not receive
the notice of hearing. Considering the fact this is the Landlord’s application, I find the
Landlord was not reasonably able to participate.
 
2.     The photographs submitted
as evidence and the Landlord’s testimony shows that the
Tenant has caused extensive damage to the rental unit.




 
3.    
The Tenant has installed walls to
create rooms that are being rented out. This has happened on the main floor as
well as in the basement. The Landlord
has had an inspection done and there are now structural issues as a result of the unauthorized work that was performed.
 
4.     The Tenant has failed to pay utility
costs which are now over $10,000.00.
 
5.     I find the Tenant has wilfully damaged
the rental unit. The Tenant has also substantially
interfered with the Landlord’s lawful right and privilege.
 
6.     I find that the Landlord
will incur costs
in excess of the amount claimed in the application to repair the damage done to
the rental home.
 
7.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order TNL-31893-21 issued on August 23, 2021 is
cancelled and replaced by the following: The tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenant is terminated, as of February 27, 2022. The Tenant
must move out of the rental unit on or before February 27, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $24,478.20, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$22,306.08, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from May 1, 2021 to
February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$82.19 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 27, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 27, 2022, then starting February
28, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
February 28, 2022. The Sheriff
is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
