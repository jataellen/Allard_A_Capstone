In the matter of:      1432 ASPENRIDGE CRESCENT
NE
LONDON ON N5Y5N2

Madilynn Turner Shaceson Turner Shareena Turner Sophia Turner


Tenants




 
 
Eyad Taysser Abusalah (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Madilynn Turner,
Shaceson Turner, Shareena
Turner and Sophia
Turner (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord's Agent, Ibrahim Albayoumi, attended the hearing. As of 11:20 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,400.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,400.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2021 to
September 24, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$11,386.83*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $78.90
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 16, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $15,586.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated; and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 4, 2022
