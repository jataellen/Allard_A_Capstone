            Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-85218-17
 










 
 
 

J.F.T.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.W.and
J.W. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they
permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on November 10, 2017 and February 5, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing on November 10,
2017.  Only the Landlord attended the hearing on February 5, 2018.  The
Landlord was represented by K.Z. both dates.  S.K.(the ‘Basement Tenant’)
attended the first hearing as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.     At
the first hearing the Tenants spoke with Tenant Duty Counsel and then stated
they wished to bring forward issues under section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  
2.     Due
to timing, only the Landlord’s application was heard on the first hearing date
and the Tenants’ section 82 issues would be heard at the next hearing date.  At
that time, an interim order was issued to both parties.  The interim order
required the Tenants to provide the Landlord with a list of issues they planned
to raise under section 82 and disclosure on or before December 1, 2017.  It
also directed the Tenants to pay new rent as it came due into the Board in
Trust.
3.     The
Tenants paid one month’s rent into the Board pursuant to the interim order.  No
further payments have been made by the Tenants.  Furthermore, the Tenants did
not provide the Landlord with the appropriate disclosure and list of issues by
December 1, 2017.
4.     The
Tenants did not attend the second hearing held on February 5, 2018, none of
their section 82 issues were disclosed and they did not comply with the interim
order; therefore, the hearing proceeded on the Landlord’s application.  Also,
because the Tenants did not attend this hearing to provide their defence to the
Landlord’s application heard at the previous hearing, the evidence submitted at
the first hearing is essentially uncontested.
Determinations:
 
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 18, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from August 2, 2017
to October 18, 2017.
4.     The
Tenants have paid $1,800.00 to the Board in trust since the application was
filed. **.
APPLICATION
FOR SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE 
5.      The
Landlord served the Tenants with a Notice of Termination under section 64 of
the Act because the Tenants were bothering the basement tenant, allowing urine
to run off of balcony, causing excessive noise, smoking marijuana and not
paying the utility bills.  The Tenants had a seven day period to remedy these
issues.
6.      The
Landlord testified that the Tenants did not pay for the utilities.  A copy of
the lease was provided by the Tenants, which indicates the Tenants are
responsible for 60% of the overall utilities for the house.  The Tenants reside
in the upstairs unit and the Basement Tenant is in the basement and is
responsible for 40% of the utilities.
7.      The
Landlord further submitted a copy of text correspondence regarding the
utilities and that the Tenants owe the Landlord.  
8.      It
was unclear whether the Tenants remedied the other items claimed in the Notice
of Termination; however, it is evident the Tenants did not void the issue
surrounding unpaid utilities.  
9.      Based
on the uncontested evidence before the Board, I am satisfied the Tenants not
paid their portion of the utilities and this conduct has substantially
interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. 
Termination of the tenancy is granted based on this Notice of Termination.
10.  I have
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 23, 2018.The amount of $1,800.00 plus accrued interest shall be
paid out to the Landlord.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $7,840.54*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $59.18 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 13, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
23, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from March 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 23, 2018, then starting March 24,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 24, 2018.
8.     The
Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount of $1,800.00 together with any
accrued interest. **
