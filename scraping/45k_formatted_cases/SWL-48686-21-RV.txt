Review Order
 
Amiraco
Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Michael Matar (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque
charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-48686-21 issued on October
20, 2021. On November 19,
2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
On November
22, 2021 interim
order SWL-48686-21-RV -IN was issued,
staying the order
issued on October 20, 2021.

mailbox in May 2021 when the Board mailed the Notice on May 26, 2021. There’s
no record on the Board’s file that the Notice was returned by Canada Post as
undelivered. The Notice was mailed out to the correct address. Pursuant

Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’)
