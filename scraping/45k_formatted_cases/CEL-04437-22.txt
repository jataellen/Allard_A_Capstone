Tenants



 
 
 
George Woods and 2732686
Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Rob Stevens and Sam Carson (the 'Tenants') and for
an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on January 5, 2022 with respect to application
CEL-98409-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified
in the order: The Tenants
failed to pay $2000.00 towards the arrears on or before December 20, 2021. The
Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly rent in full, on or before January 1,
2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$8,916.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-98409-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $8,916.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order CEL-98409-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,350.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 25, 2017 to January 21, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-98409-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $9,852.82*.
This amount represents the rent owing up to January 21, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent
deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$46.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 22, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2022, then starting February
2, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 2, 2022.
 
 
January 21, 2022

The tenant has until January 31, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 31, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 2, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
