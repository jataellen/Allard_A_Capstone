On February 7, 2022, Zhiyi Du (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alexandra Senterre (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the
tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to
terminate the tenancy as of January 16, 2022 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date
set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 7, 2022, then starting
March 8, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
