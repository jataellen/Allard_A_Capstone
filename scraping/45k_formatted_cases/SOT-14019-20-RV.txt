Tenant




 


and


 




 


Alan Mclean


Landlord



 
Review Order
 
Veronica King (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Alan Mclean
(the 'Landlord'), gave a
notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was resolved by order
SOT-14019-20 issued on August 10, 2021.
On August 20, 2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
On August 31, 2021 interim order SOT-14019-20 -IN was issued.
 
The request was heard
by videoconference on November 26, 2021.The Tenant,
the Tenant’s Representative,
Carrie Lynn-Lee, and the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant and her Representative both stated
they did not receive the Board’s Notice
of Hearing held on August 4, 2021.
 
2.     On the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a
serious error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the proceedings.
 
3.     Rule 5 of the Board’s
Rules of Procedure gives the Board the discretion to serve a Notice of hearing by email in appropriate circumstances. As the Board is operating in the
middle of a pandemic, the Board issued a Notice to the Tenant and another to
her Representative electronically through email on June 18, 2021 at 11:48 a.m.
The email addresses were verified
at the hearing and were the same email addresses they provided to the
Board. The email addresses were correct and there was no clerical error made.
 
4.     The Board also emailed the Order issued on August 10, 2021
by email to the same email
addresses the Notice was sent. The Tenant nor her Representative could explain
why their email account both accepted the Order and not the Notice.

5.    
The Tenant stated she didn’t see
the email containing the Notice and that she checked her history ‘yesterday’ which would be November 25, 2021. This is over five months
after the Notice was issued. She stated her emails are gone after 30
days.
 
6.     The Representatives’ email
address is not a general
email address for the legal
aid clinic. The
Representative’s email address is a personalized employee email that identifies
her surname and initials. The
Representative stated she did not have access to her email and provided no
reasonable explanation or evidence to explain and understand what if any
technical problems related to her account occurred. She is in the best position
to respond to know how her technology would have interfered with not having
received the Notice and she did not demonstrate such circumstances.
 
7.     The Board sent one email to all the parties containing
the Notice on June 18, 2021 at 11:48 a.m and it included
the Landlord’s email address. The Landlord received
the email containing the
Notice and attended the hearing on August 4, 2021. It’s very improbable
the Board’s technology could have interfered with service when one recipient received the Notice. It’s
also unlikely that the email would be lost in cyber space for both the Tenant
and her Representative.
 
8.     There’s no record on the Tenant’s file that the emails were undelivered. Had there been a
return email, the Board would have mailed the Notice to the Tenant’s address
and to her Representative as per Board procedure and they did not.
 
9.     Pursuant to subsection 191(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
(the ‘Act’) the Notice is deemed to have been given 5
days after mailing.
 
10.  This is not a situation where the Tenant was inadvertently prevented from attending the hearing as a result of Board’s
procedural process. It appears the Tenant and her Representative did not
participate a result of their own negligence.
11.  As stated by the Court in Q Res IV Operating CP
Inc. v. Berezovska 2017 ONSC 5541, “[I]f parties are not diligent in
dealing with legal proceedings then they cannot demand that a Tribunal waste
its resources by rehearing matters a second time. To allow this would undermine the ability of the administration of justice to deliver timely
cost-effective and final orders.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order SOT-14019-20 issued on August 10, 2021 is
denied. The order is confirmed
and remains unchanged.
