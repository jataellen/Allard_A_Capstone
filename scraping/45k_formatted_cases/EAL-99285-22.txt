Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99285-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


09, 16 RUSSELL STREET KINGSTON ON K7K2E4


 




Between:


Sisopha Say


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kathy Shewan


Tenant



 
 
 
Sisopha Say (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kathy Shewan (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board
on November 23, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-96944-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $900 rent on or before February
1, 2022. The Tenant did not pay
$100.00 arrears on or before
February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $3,277.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-96944-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $3,077.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-96944-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $900.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2019 to
February 16, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-96944-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 27, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,613.46*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 16, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 17, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 27, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 27, 2022, then starting February
28, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 28, 2022.
 
 
February 16, 2022

The tenant has until February 26, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 26, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 28, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
