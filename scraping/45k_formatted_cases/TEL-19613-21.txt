Christina Wu (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ji Ping
Huang, Qin Yao Zhang and Jansen Huang (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 25, 2022.
 
The Landlord Christina Wu, the Landlord’s witness Rose Chan attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.       
At the hearing, the Landlord
testified that she did not pay compensation equal to one month’s rent to
the Tenant on or before
the termination date of December
14, 2021 noted on the N12 Notice to End the
Tenancy because the Landlord’s Chid Requires the Unit.
 
2.       
Section 48.1 of the Act provides
that a landlord shall compensate a tenant in an amount
equal to one month’s rent if the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination
of the tenancy under section 48.
 
3.       
Section 55.1 of the Act requires
that this compensation be paid no later than the
termination date in the notice served.
 
4.       
Because the Landlord failed
to comply with section 55.1 of the Act, the Board
has no authority to terminate
the tenancy under these circumstances.
 
5.       
This order contains all the reasons
in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
