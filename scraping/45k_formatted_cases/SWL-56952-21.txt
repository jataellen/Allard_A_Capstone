Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter of:


12, 84 KING EDWARD AVENUE LONDON ON N5Z3S8


 




Between:


King Edward
Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Moo Loo Ku Paw Aeh


Tenants



 
 
 
King Edward Apartments (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Moo Loo Ku and Paw Aeh (the 'Tenants') The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on February 17,
2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Kasandra
Jang, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The
Landlord’s application is based on two notices
that were served pursuant
to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') (the “1st N5”) and pursuant
to 68 of the Act (the “2nd N5”). The
notices comply with all of the mandatory requirements of the Act and are valid.
 
2.    
The Landlord says that the Tenants have failed to prepare
the rental unit for pest control treatment and this inaction
substantially interferes with the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or
interest. At the hearing, the Landlord provided pest control reports, a unit
preparation instruction sheet as well as pictures from inside the rental unit which confirm that the Tenants have failed to
prepare the rental unit for pest control treatment. The Landlord served the
Tenants with the 1st N5 to give them an opportunity to correct their
behaviour by preparing the rental unit for treatment. However, the pictures of
the rental unit confirm that, although
the Tenants made some efforts
to prepare the unit, they failed
to clear out the cupboards, remove garbage and clean up sitting water in the
rental unit. The Landlord then served the 2nd N5 notice and the
Tenants continued to fail to properly prepare the unit for
pest control treatment.

3.    
Based on the evidence before me, I
am satisfied that the Tenants repeatedly failed to prepare the rental unit for pest control treatment
and this inaction
substantially interferes with
the Landlord’s lawful right, privilege or interest.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). In particular, I have considered the Landlord’s
request for a conditional order
requiring the Tenants to prepare
the rental unit for pest control treatment,
subject to the Landlord’s right to apply
for an order to evict the Tenants in the event of a
breach. For these reasons, I find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
For the period commencing March 1,
2022, to February 28, 2023, and after receiving written notice of an upcoming pest control treatment, the Tenants shall prepare the rental
unit in accordance with the instructions contained in the “Cockroach Treatment
Preparation” sheet.
 
2.    
If the Tenants fail to adhere to
the conditions outlined in paragraph 1 of this order, the Landlord may, without notice
to the Tenants, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of
the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants. The Landlord must make
this application no later than 30 days after the Tenants’ failure
to make a payment.
 
3.     On or before March 30, 2022, the Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $186.00 for the costs
of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 30, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
