John Larter


Tenant



 
 
 
Thuy Phuong
Tran (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
John Larter (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Thuy Phuong Tran, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Thirusenthuran
Sivapatham, attended the hearing. The
Tenant was not present nor represented although properly served a Notice of
Hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice of
Termination (‘the Notice’) on August
20, 2021 that clearly identified the allegations being made against the Tenant.
 
2.     The allegations set out in the Notice
included that on or about
May 24 and June 26, 2021, the Tenant was not wearing a mask
in the elevator contrary to the condominium’s Covid- 19 policy and that he
abused another Tenant. On or about
June 1, 2021, the Tenant negligently damaged the balcony glass divider between
his rental unit and the attached unit. On
or about July 16, 2021, the Tenant spilled a liquid in the elevator causing a
permanent stain and on or about July 31, 2021, the Tenant spilled wine in the
hallway causing a permanent stain.




 
3.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted that the
Landlord was pursuing the application based on the damages to the balcony glass
divider only and was not presenting any evidence with respect to the other
allegations.
 
The Damaged
Balcony Glass Divider
 
4.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted exhibit
LL#1, which is a series of photos taken June 2021 to evidence the shattered
balcony glass divider.
 
5.     The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted exhibit
LL#2, which was an email thread between the Landlord and the Tenant whereas the
Tenant admitted to negligently breaking the balcony glass divider by throwing a
bottle of liquor at the glass divider. The
Tenant agreed to pay for the damages,
sometime in the first week of
August 2021, for the total amount of $1,666.75.
 
6.     The Landlord testified that after receiving an invoice
from Highrise Glazing, as evidenced by exhibit LL #3, she paid for the damages
to the balcony glass divider .The Landlord further testified that she has not
been reimbursed by the Tenant for the damages.
 
7.    
I am persuaded by the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence and submissions. On
a balance of probabilities, I find that the Tenant wilfully or negligently
caused damage to the rental unit as described in Schedule A of the Notice. Further, I find that the Tenant did not
void the Notice as provided for under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
8.     The Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy, an
order for the Tenant to reimburse her for the damages and the cost for filing
the application. The Landlord further
testified that she has been in contact with the Tenant’s parents and has been
advised that the Tenant will not be returning to the rental unit although the
keys have not been returned to the Landlord.
 
9.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of March 1, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 1, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 1, 2022,
then starting March 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,666.75, which
represents the reasonable costs of
replacing the damaged balcony glass divider.




 
 
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from March 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
