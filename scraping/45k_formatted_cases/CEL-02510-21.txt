Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02510-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


UPPER UNIT A, 1024 MACLEAN STREET INNISFIL ON L9S1V8


 




Between:


Ashley Knack Scott Knack


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Ellen Goodfellow John Cardoso
Leslie
Gomes


Superintendents



 
 
 
Ashley Knack and Scott Knack (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leslie Gomes, Ellen Goodfellow and John Cardoso
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 6, 2021. Only the Only the Landlord's
Agent, Ellen Good Fellow
attended the hearing. As of 3:40 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August 18, 2021.
 
1.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
2.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,800.00.
 
3.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
2.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
1, 2019 to August 18, 2021.




 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords
$7,450.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit
is not vacated on or before January
15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlords, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,986.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be
void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
