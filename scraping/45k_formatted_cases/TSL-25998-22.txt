and
 




Chloe O'Riordan David Hayes


Tenants




 
 
 
On January 12, 2022, Briarlane
Rental Property Management In Trust Of CMHC (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David Hayes and
Chloe O'Riordan (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition
specified in the consent order
issued by the Board
on December 29, 2021 with respect to L1 application TSL-23694-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the
Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed
to pay the lawful monthly rent, on or before January
1, 2022. This was
a breach of the consent order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of
the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4
application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$6,536.00 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-23694-21. The amount that is still owing from that order
is $3,536.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order TSL-23694-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On December 1, 2017, the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,418.00 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest was last paid out to the Tenants
up to the period ending December, 31, 20202.
Interest is owing on the rent deposit for the period from January 1, 2021 to
this order date, January 25, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
TSL-23694-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move
out of the rental
unit on or before
February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations
below.
 
See attached Summary
of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,282.31*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 25, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $46.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022
to the date the Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.

The tenant
has until February
4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 4, 2022 the order will be
stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August
6, 2022 if the order has not been filed
on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the
rental unit is located.
