Order under Section
100
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34374-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      119, 67 GODSTONE
ROAD
NORTH YORK ON M2J3C8
 
Between:                  Yanyan Li                                                                                                      Landlord
 
 
And
 
Gorken Picakci                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
and
 
David Unknown                                                                    Unauthorized Occupant
 
 
Yanyan Li (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of Gorken Picakci (the 'Tenant'),
and for compensation for the use of the rental unit because the Tenant
transferred possession of the unit to
David Unknown (the Unauthorized Occupant) in a manner
not permitted under the
Residential Tenancies Act , 2006 (the Act).
 
The application was heard by videoconference on February 3, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, Rong Wei Yu, and the Landlord attended
the hearing. By 3:40 p.m.,
neither the Tenant nor the Unauthorized Occupant attended the hearing though
properly served with the Notice of Hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord testified that the Tenant texted the
Landlord on July 30, 2021 stating: that the
Tenant vacated the rental unit on July 30, 2021;
that the Tenant
left the key to the unit
in the mail box of the unit and; that
an individual identified only by his given name, David, remained in the unit
and refused to leave.
 
2.     The Landlord further testified that thereafter she
went the unit, at which time the person who answered the door identified themselves only as David and stated that he refused
to leave the unit.
As well, the keys were not in the mailbox
and were not otherwise found by
the Landlord.




 
3.    
The Landlord
further testified: that no rent has been paid since August
1, 2022; that David
continues to occupy the unit and that; the monthly rent for the unit is
$2,500.00.
 
4.     Based on the above uncontested and believable
testimony I determined: that the
Tenant transferred the occupancy of the unit to the Unauthorized Occupant in a manner
that was not authorized by
the Act; that the Landlord did not enter into a tenancy agreement with this
person; and that; the Unauthorized Occupant
was in possession of the rental unit
on the date the application was filed.
 
5.     Based on the above uncontested and believable
testimony I also determined that the Landlord is entitled to compensation for
the use of the unit from August 1, 2021 to February 7, 2022 in the amount
of $15,616.10, based
on the daily compensation rate of
$82.19.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. Specifically, the Landlord
did not identify
such circumstances and none
appeared from my review of the record.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated as of February
18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall move out of the rental
unit on or before
February 18, 2022.
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated by February 18, 2022, then
starting February 19, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (the Sheriff), so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord after February 19, 2022.
 
5.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall pay to the Landlord
$15,616.10, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from August 1, 2021 to February 7, 2022.
 
6.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall also pay the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
7.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing by February 18, 2022.
 
8.     If the Unauthorized Occupant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing by February 18, 2022, they will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 19,
2022 at 2.00% on the outstanding balance.




 
9.    
The Unauthorized Occupant shall
also pay to the Landlord $82.19 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February
19, 2022 to the date they move out of the unit.
