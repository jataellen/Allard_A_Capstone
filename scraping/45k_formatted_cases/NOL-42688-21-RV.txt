Tammy Gravelle


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tammy Gravelle (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order NOL-42688-21 issued on September 2, 2021. On October
1, 2021, the Tenant requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s representative D. Sager and the Tenant’s
legal representative T. Lasook attended the hearing. As of 9:58 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Note: The Tenant’s legal
representative had instructions with respect to the review
hearing but not the de novo
L1 hearing that followed. I allowed the Tenant’s legal representative to
give information within her knowledge regarding factors relevant to the L1
application but the L1 application was essentially unopposed.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Tenant’s request
for a review is based
on the ground of serious
error.
 
2.     The Tenant submitted that the consent
order issued on September 2, 2021 did not reflect the agreement that was made at
the hearing on August 19, 2021. The order terminates the tenancy on October
31, 2021 and does not give the Tenant an opportunity to void the




 
eviction by paying the amount owed to the Landlord. The Tenant submitted
that she agreed to a voidable
order.
 
3.     AW is the Landlord’s resident manager. At the review
hearing AW testified that her understanding was that the Tenant had agreed to a
non-voidable termination, as the Tenant had said at one point that she just
wanted to leave. However, AW’s notes from the
hearing indicate that the parties
agreed to an “eviction order if not paid.” This strongly
suggests that the parties were
agreeing to an order that would give the Tenant an option to stay if she paid
off the arrears.
 
4.     A recording of the hearing
on August 19, 2021 is not available.
 
5.     Based on the above, I find, on a balance of
probabilities, that the parties agreed to a voidable termination order. I therefore find that there
is a serious error in the order.
At the hearing I granted the
Tenant’s request for a review.
 
6.    
The least intrusive way to remedy
the order would be to amend it to make it voidable by paying the arrears by
October 31, 2021. However, that would be unfair to the Tenant, who filed her
request for a review well before that date. The review request was sent to a
hearing on October 18, 2021. This is also well before the termination date in
the order. The order was under review on the date which was the Tenant’s
deadline to pay (if the order was voidable) and was found to contain
a fundamental serious
error as was alleged
by the Tenant. It would be unfair to
the Tenant in these circumstances to retroactively set October 31, 2021 as the
voiding date. For this reason, the original order will be cancelled and I heard
the L1 application de novo.
 
L1 application
 
7.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 6,
2021.
 
8.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
9.     The monthly rent is $894.10.
 
10.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $894.10 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
11.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to April 6, 2021.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
13.  I have considered that this is a lengthy tenancy (it
started in 2009), that the arrears accumulated
in part because of the death of the Tenant’s
partner and that the Tenant has
two grandchildren of school age living with her.
 
14.  I have also considered that I cannot order a payment
plan without submissions from the Tenant. I have further considered AW’s testimony that the Tenant
has been seen moving
belongings out of the unit recently and that the Tenant told her that the
Tenant intends to return the keys on
January 19, 2022. I give AW’s testimony a great deal of weight because earlier
in the hearing AW made an admission that was against the Landlord’s interests
in the review. Based on this testimony, it appears that the Tenant will not be
prejudiced by a standard order without any postponement of the termination
date, which will be after January 19, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order NOL-42688-21 issued
on August 31, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,516.40*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
20, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.40
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
9.     If, on or before January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $6,902.61** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
