Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97278-21
 
 
In the matter of:      487 GARNEAU STREET
HAWKESBURY ON K6A1M6
 




Between:                  Dominick Dicaire Jonathan Dicaire


Landlords




 
 
and
 




Jean-raymond Baker Ryan Baker


Tenants




 
 
 
Dominick Dicaire and Jonathan
Dicaire (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan Baker and Jean-raymond Baker (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 6,
2021.
 
Only the Landlords attended the
hearing. As of 1:25 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective July 7, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord submitted that the
Tenants only paid 2 and half months of rent since the tenancy started
in January 2021. The Landlord
further submitted that the Tenants
do not follow up on their
promises to pay. The Landlord stated that the Tenants told him that they will
pay the rent arrears when they receive their tax returns but failed to make any
payment subsequently.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. Based on the uncontested evidence
provided by the Landlord at the hearing, I find that the Tenants failed to pay
their rent in full. I see no reason to deny the eviction requested by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: EAL-97278-21
 
 
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $8,603.40*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords
$23.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenants
wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$8,951.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,651.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 6, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
