Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56080-21



In the
  matter of:


312, 1666
OUELLETTE AVENUE WINDSOR ON
  N8X4V2


 




Between:


Ira
  Udaskin
Marine City Apartments


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Stacey Gagnon


Tenant



 
 
Ira Udaskin and Marine City
Apartments (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stacey
Gagnon (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
video conference on February 3, 2022. Only
the Landlord, Ira Udaskin, attended the hearing. As of 10:08 a.m. the Tenant was not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2021 is
$798.77.
4.     
The Tenant paid $1,188.07 after the application was filed.
 
5.     
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $789.30 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlords.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 1, 2014 to
September 24, 2021.
 
7.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with section 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SWL-56080-21
 
 
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 7, 2022.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $2,528.89*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
24, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$26.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 25, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before March 7,
2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 8, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 8, 2022.
 
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)         
$3,752.67 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)        
$4,551.44 if the payment
is made on or before
March 7, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March
8, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
