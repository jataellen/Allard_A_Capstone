Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36605-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN & 2ND FLOOR, 96 CATALPA CRESCENT VAUGHAN ON L6A0R6


 




Between:


Zichun Bai


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Danny Ormonde
Freitas
Dillon Valerio Freitas De Oliveria


Tenants



 
 
 
Zichun Bai (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dillon Valerio Freitas De Oliveria and Danny Ormonde
Freitas (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.

the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on September 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this
date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial
