Leah Taylor


Tenant



 
 
On January 10, 2022, Falls View Terrance Non-profit Homes C/O Shabri
Properties Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Leah Taylor (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on December 21, 2021 with respect to
application SOL-24759-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$259.00 on or before December
24, 2021 towards arrears of
rent and costs.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the
payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$259.00 for rent arrears in Order SOL-24759-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $259.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order SOL-24759-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant
has also failed to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
Since the date of the order,
the Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00
for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant
which were returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
7.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $234.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-24759-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $626.66*. This amount represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022 and the total charges related to NSF cheques
tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$28.83 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January
30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 1, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the
Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
