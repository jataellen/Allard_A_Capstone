In the matter
of:


204, 576
WOOLWICH STREET GUELPH ON

Between:


The Corporation Of The County

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Crystal Savoie


Tenant



 
 
 
The Corporation Of The County Of
Wellington (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Crystal Savoie (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. ; because the Tenant or another occupant
of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental
unit or the residential complex. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on February 9, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Representative, Peter Schroader attended
the hearing. Lynn Johnson also attended as a witness for the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On September 16, 2021, the Tenant’s guest, A. Levy
committed an illegal act in the residential
complex. Photographs show the Tenant’s
guest in the common area removing
and walking away holding a ceiling tile and security camera. The witness
confirmed the person in the photograph is A. Levy, a guest of the Tenant. The
Occurrence Incident Report produced by police confirmed the Tenant’s guest was
charged with mischief causing damage under
$5,000.00 and theft contrary
to section 334(b) and section 430(4)
of the Criminal Code of Canada.
 
2.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Landlord is seeking a conditional order to
give the Tenant a chance to preserve the tenancy.




File Number: SOL-25956-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant, an occupant of the

2.    
If the Tenant fails to
comply with paragraph 1 of this order for a period
of 24 months, the Landlord may, without notice
to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of
the Act for an order
terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must file their application within 30 days after the breach.
