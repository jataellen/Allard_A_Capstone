Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-20880-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


603, 111 CHESTNUT STREET TORONTO ON M5G 2J1


 




Between:


Toronto Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Roobi Galmo Sabrina
Galmo


Tenants



 
 
 
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Roobi Galmo and Sabrina Galmo (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 26, 2022. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Dale
Maingot attended the hearing. As of 2:45 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2019 to October 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 9, 2019.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,526.00.
 
4.     The Tenants paid $3,600.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     There is no last month’s
rent deposit.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to
the Landlord $35,000.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022, but limited by the Board’s
jurisdiction.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $50.17
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $36,904.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
