Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-16817-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 338 KING STREET WELLAND ON L3B3K3


 




Between:


Bruno Carusetta


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Miranda
Leonard


Tenant



 
 
 
Bruno Carusetta
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Miranda Leonard (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord
has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 29, 2021. Only the Landlord
attended the hearing. As of
11:50 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing as it appears from the Certificate
of Service.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The application is
based on a single voidable Notice of Termination (form ‘form ‘N5’) deemed served
on the Tenant on August
28, 2020 wit a termination date of September
9, 2020 because the Tenant or an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential
complex by the Tenant has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the rental unit by dislodging the unit front door by
kicking it.
 
2.    
The Landlord
advised that a guest of the Tenant
kicked in the front door to
the rental unit. The Tenant re-hung the door however, after an inspection
by the Welland Fire Department, it was determined the door no longer met the
fire safety code and required replacement.
 
3.    
The Landlord
will incur costs
of $810.00 to replace property that was damaged and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
4.    
The Tenant vacated the
rental unit in “early summer.” Because
the Tenant no longer resides in the rental unit,
the application for eviction is moot and consideration will only be




File Number: SOL-16817-20
 
given to the damage claim pursuant to section 89 of the Residential Tenancies
Act (2006, (the ‘Act’).
 
5.    
I find that based on
the balance of probabilities, the Tenant or their guest wilfully or negligently caused damage to the rental
unit and that the cost of $810.00
to replace the damaged door is reasonable and owing
to the Landlord.
 
6.    
At the hearing the Landlord
sought to claim an additional $6,699.14 in damages discovered after the Tenant
vacated the rental unit. The
increased damages is not reflected in the Application, nor the Notice to Terminate the Tenancy (N5). The Tenant is
not aware of additional costs the Landlord is claiming. The Tenant has the right to be aware of the allegations against
her. In this matter this is not the
case. It would be unfairly
prejudicial to the Tenant to award damages for which she is not aware,
therefore no additional damage will be considered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated the date the Tenant moved out of the rental unit.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$810.00, which represents the reasonable costs
of replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.
