File Number: TSL-20970-21

1211, 25 MABELLE AVENUE TORONTO ON M9A4Y1


 




Between:


North Edge
Proerties Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Farin Rezai


Tenant



 
 
 
North Edge Proerties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Farin Rezai (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via
videoconference on July 21, 2021 at
1:00 p.m.
 
Only the
Landlord, represented by Jason Paine, a licensed Paralegal, attended the
hearing. The Tenant, Farin Rezai, was not present or represented at the hearing
though being properly
served with the Notice of Hearing by the Board.
The hearing proceeded without
the Tenants at 3:49 p.m.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 7,
2021.
 
2.     The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit when the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,333.70.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,197.43 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1, 2020
to March 7, 2021.




 
6.    
As of the hearing
date, the Tenant owed the Landlord, $4,345.07 including arrears of rent to July 31, 2021 of
$4,159.07 and the application fee of $186.00. Since the hearing, another seven
rental periods have begun, and seven more month’s rent have become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes
August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021, December
2021, January 2022 and February 2022’s rent. If the Tenant has paid the
Landlord August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021, December
2021, January 2022 and February 2022’s rent, and /or made any payments to the
Landlord since the hearing, the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the
amount owing in this order.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Tenants did not attend the hearing to present evidence or
submissions in support of granting
relief from eviction and no circumstances were disclosed at the hearing or
appeared in the Board file.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$15,072.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 2, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$43.85 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 3, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 13, 2022, then starting
February 14, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 14, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $17,595.97** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment




 
is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 14, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
