Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006










 
 

MSK or the Landlord applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict CCES or the Tenant because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 Application)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has used the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner
that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has caused or
can be expected to cause significant damage;  and because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential
complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has
three or fewer residential units.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.  (L2
Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on
January 23, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.  As well, ZK was in attendance as a co-landlord and
instructing witness.  I did not call this matter forward on an uncontested
basis until 12:40 pm.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective December 18, 2017.
2.     
MSK confirmed there is no
last month’s rent deposit being held by the Landlord
3.     
MSK confirmed the Tenant did
not make any payment to the Landlord after the filing of the application.
L2 Application
4.     
MSK stated that he and ZK
live in a unit above the Tenant’s rental unit, and there are only two units in
the building.
5.     
The Landlord served the
Tenant with a 10-Day Notice to Terminate a Tenancy Early (the ‘N7 notice’) on December
3, 2017.  The termination date in the N7 notice is December 14, 2017 and
Landlord is seeking termination of the tenancy on the following grounds:   the
Tenant has permitted at least five other people to reside in the unit and they
have caused disturbances late at night and into the morning hours, have smoked
in the unit, have strewn garbage about the property, and have fought outside
the rental unit.  
6.     
MSK confirmed that he is
only submitting on the claim of substantial interference with reasonable
enjoyment and lawful rights, and MSK confirmed that the Tenant and her
occupants do use the rental unit as a residential unit.  As this does not
prejudice the Tenant, I permitted the narrowing of the application to the
single basis.
7.     
MSK testified the Tenant had
originally applied for the rental unit so she and her 2-year old son would live
there.  MSK stated that instead, the Tenant and her friend moved in, and then
allowed more than three others to use the rental unit.
8.     
MSK submitted exhibit LL#1,
which is a series of security camera photos taken on November 17 and 24/2017
and on January 12/2018, to evidence the coming and going of people into the
rental unit late on those nights.
9.     
MSK testified that on
November 17/2017 between 6:30 pm and 3:30 am, there were 8 to 10 people in and
around the unit.  MSK stated they caused so much noise, that they began to
fight and throw items at one another. MSK testified the police were called and
exhibit LL#2 provides photo evidence of policing arriving that evening.
10.  
Apart from November 17th,
MSK testified the police had be called a number of times to the unit because of
undue noise, fights, smell of smoke and use of drugs.  MSK submitted exhibit
LL#3, which is a description of the incidents requiring police intervention on
November 23, 27/2107, December 27/2017 and January 12, 21/2018.
11.  
MSK testified the unit was
rented to the Tenant as a ‘no-smoking’ unit, and the Tenant acknowledged that
her permitted guests were smoking inside the unit (exhibit LL#5).
12.  
MSK testified the Tenant and
her permitted guests dismantled the smoke and CO alarms so that no alarms would
trigger from the smoking that went on inside the unit daily.  
13.  
MSK stated he contacted the
Fire Department to inspect the unit and exhibit LL#4 was submitted by MSK to
evidence the inspectors including one from the SPCA, whom MSK had called to
inspect the unit.  MSK testified that one of the inspectors, BD informed him
that the alarms were functional but not working when he arrived.
14.  
MSK testified that the
frequent noise, smoking and fighting have impacted his and his family’s ability
to live above.  MSK testified he himself suffers from hypertension and diabetes
(although no medical documentation was submitted to support this part of the
testimony).  MSK and ZK testified that their children are afraid of the Tenant
and her permitted occupant(s) and guests.
15.  
MSK submitted exhibits LL#6
and LL#7, which are a series of text message notices from the Landlord to the
Tenant, and associated photographs, all concerning two of the instances when
garbage was strewn about the rental unit by the Tenant and/or her occupant(s)
and guests on October 21/2017 and December 14/20217.
16.  
ZK testified that one of the
male friends of the Tenant living inside the unit was arrested recently by
police and ZK believes it was because of something to do with drugs.  This was
not supported by any direct evidence so I do not place much weight on this part
of the testimony.
17.  
On a balance of
probabilities, the uncontested testimony and evidence of the Landlord are
sufficiently persuasive and reasonable for me to find that the Tenant, a
co-occupant and/or a guest of the Tenant, have substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment and/or lawful rights of the Landlord.  
18.  
In other words, I find in
favour of the Landlord’s application and am granting the Landlord’s request to
terminate the tenancy in a final way.
19.  
I provided this decision
orally at the hearing.  Since the termination date set out in the N7 notice of
termination has well passed, the Landlord requested a standard eleven-day
non-remedial (final) termination date.
20.  
If his request for a
non-remedial termination date is granted for 11-days after the date of this
order, the Landlord then requested that the L1 application be converted into an
L9 application for arrears only.  As there were no circumstances disclosed to
give me any reason not to grant this request, I agreed to order a standard
eleven-day non-remedial termination date under the L2 application, and to
convert the L1 application into an L9 application for arrears only.
Section 83
21.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 and L2 Applications
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated in a final way (non-remedial) effectively
on February 10, 2018.  
2.     
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before February 10, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,205.84*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to January 30, 2018 (the date of this order).
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 10, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 11, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 10, 2018, then starting February 11, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 11, 2018.
