Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12414-21
 
In the matter of:      145 MONEYPENNY PLACE
THORNHILL ON L4J0L1
 




Between:                  Rostam Khosraviani Nahid
Arjasbi


Landlords




 
and
 




Kermeisha Kerr A.K.A. Kermeisha Lediamond Precious


Tenant




 
Rostam Khosraviani and Nahid
Arjasbi (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kermeisha
Kerr A.K.A. Kermeisha Lediamond Precious (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. As of 3:00
p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, Ali Golabgir, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October
14, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $3,050.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords are not holding a last
month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant made no payments after
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is
ordered that:




 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $25,636.24*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $100.27 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 23,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 22, 2022, then starting
February 23, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 22, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $27,636.00** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
