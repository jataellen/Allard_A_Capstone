Martha Young


Tenant



 
 
 
217440 Ontario Ltd. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Martha Young
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
24, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s representative Howard Tavroges attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 4, 2021
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
1, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of October
31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,824.95*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before November 11, 2021,
the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from November 12, 2021
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
