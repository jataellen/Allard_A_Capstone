Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25723-21-SA
 



In the matter
of:


UNIT 112,
187 QUEEN VICTORIA DRIVE HAMILTON ON L8W1W6


 




Between:


Mohammed Anas
Khan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Donatella Pepe


Tenant



 
 
Mohammed Anas
Khan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Donatella Pepe (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
That application
was resolved by order SOL-25723-21
issued on December 1, 2021. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order
SOL-25723-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 31, 2022. The Landlord, the Landlord's
Legal Representative, L. Barder and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Landlord and the Tenant signed an Agreement to End
the Tenancy (N11) with a termination date of September 30, 2021.
 
2.   
The Landlord filed an eviction application under section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 alleging that the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination date set out in the agreement. This
resulted in ex parte eviction order SOL-25723-21.
 
3.    The Tenant testified that having signed the notice of termination,
she has had trouble securing alternative accommodation. The Tenant recently
secured a property with an expected closing date of March 31, 2022 and
requested an opportunity to reside
in the unit with a possible move out date prior to March 31, 2022.
 
4.    The Landlord stated that the notice of termination was signed in good faith and allowing
the Tenant to stay in the unit
to March 31, 2022, will be prejudicial taking into consideration
the enforcement period if the Tenant did not vacate the unit by March 31, 2022.
The Landlord compromised by asking that the stay is lifted on March 5, 2022.
 
5.    I have considered all the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 78(11)
(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it
would be unfair to grant the Tenant’s motion.
