In the matter of:      1570 BRIAR AVENUE
SUDBURY ON P3A4J1
 
Between:                  Greater Sudbury

Tenants




 
 
 
Greater Sudbury Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Brodie Lavoie-Kingsbury and Sheryl Lavoie (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants failed to meet a condition specified
in the mediated settlement issued
by the Board on September
25, 2018 with respect to application NOL-32942-18.
 
On December 1, 2021 Greater Sudbury
Housing Corporation (the ‘Landlord’) requested that order
NOL-44293-21 issued on November 26, 2021, be reviewed.
 
On December 9, 2021, the Board issued interim
order NOL-44293-21-RV-IN granting
the Landlord’s preliminary request to review and directed the matter to
a review hearing.
 
In the request, the Landlord
alleged that the order issued on November 26, 2021 contained a serious error because Member dismissed the L4 application on the basis that the breach is not
connected to a ground for termination in the underlying application.
 
This application was heard by way
of video conference on February 3, 2022. The Landlord’s Agents, Francine
MacMillan and Rebecca
Osmond, the Tenant,
Sheryl Lavoie and the Tenants’ Legal Representative, Yvan Pilon
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
At the hearing, the Landlord’s Agents sought the consent of the Board to withdraw
their request to review the order as they recognized they filed the L4
application in error. In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I
consent to the withdrawal of the application. The Landlord’s Agents submitted
that this was their first time as property managers and did not intentionally
make the error.




File Number: NOL-44293-21-RV
 
2.       
The Tenants’ Representative submitted
that the Landlord
should be ordered
to pay cost for the Tenants legal fees. The Tenants’ Representative that $500.00 cost would be
appropriate to cover the Tenants legal fees to prep and attend todays hearing.
 
3.       
I decline to order the Landlord to
pay costs to the Tenants. I say this
because I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they filed this
application as abuse of process or on
the premise that they did not
have substantial grounds to do so. Rather,
I am of the opinion that
this was an error on their part given their newness to the position of property
managers for the Landlord. Further,
as soon as the Landlord Agents realized they made a mistake, they did not
prolong the hearing and immediately spoke up to address the issue.
 
4.       
The matter having been withdrawn; the Board’s file is closed.
