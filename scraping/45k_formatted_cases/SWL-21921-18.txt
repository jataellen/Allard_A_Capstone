Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-21921-18
 











 
 

ASPE (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict GD and JB
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard in London on October 29, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant, GD attended the hearing. The Tenant appeared on
behalf of both Tenants and declined the opportunity to speak with Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.    The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit. 
 
2.    The monthly rent is $710.00.
 
3.    The Tenants have not paid the total rent they
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2018 to October 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 18, 2018.
 
4.    The Tenants paid $532.50 after the application
was filed.
 
5.    For the reasons set out below, the Tenants is
entitled to an abatement of rent of $142.00 for the Landlord’s failure
to comply with order SWT-17657-18.
 
6.    The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $710.00
from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to September 18, 2018.
 
8.    I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
Maintenance
(S.82)
 
9.    At the hearing the Tenants raised the following maintenance
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'): cockroach infestation and a broken front
door locking system.

The
     Tenant testified that on July 4, 2018, order SWT-17657-18 was issued by
     the Board with regards to the maintenance application he filed. The
     Landlord was ordered to hire a professional pest control company to
     address the cockroach infestation and to repair or replace the front entry
     door, the handle and lock.

 

The
     Tenant stated that the front door is in a worse condition than before and
     that the current locking system moves and the door cannot be properly
     shut.

 

The
     Tenant also testified that there are cockroaches running around everywhere
     in his rental unit and can even be found in the fridge and oven. 

 

The
     Landlord gave evidence that after he received the order, he hired a
     renovation specialist who strengthened the lose lock with longer nails. He
     stated that the female Tenant checked the door afterwards and was
     satisfied with it.

 

He
     further stated that on July 11, 2018, he contacted a professional pest
     control technician who attended the unit to treat it for cockroaches and
     recommended a total of three treatments. The Landlord followed up with a
     second treatment with the superintendent on October 2, 2018.

 
Analysis
 

Section
     20 (1) of the Act  states that a Landlord is responsible for providing and
     maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a
     good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health,
     safety, housing and maintenance standards. 

 

Order
     SWT-17657-18 issued on July 4, 2018, orders the Landlord to hire a
     professional pest control company to treat the unit and to repair or
     replace the front entry door, and fix the door handle and lock as
     necessary. 

 

With
     regards to the cockroaches, I find that the Landlord partially complied
     with the order.  A pest control technician was hired but only one
     treatment was conducted even though three treatments were recommended. The
     second treatment was carried out by the Landlord and the superintendent
     who are not professional pest control technicians three months after the
     first treatment. More importantly, the Landlord has not adequately
     addressed the issue as the infestation has continued.

 

With
     regards to the front door, order
SWT-17657-18 found that the front door was
     deteriorating and could no longer hold the lock and door handle properly
     and the Landlord was ordered to repair or replace the door. The Landlords
     repair efforts were inadequate. He strengthened the lock with longer nails
     but this was a temporary fix as the Tenant’s evidence is that the lock is still
     loose and the door does not shut. 

 

The
     Landlord is in breach of the portions of the order relating to the
     extermination of the cockroaches and repairing the front door. Order SWT-17657-18
     authorizes the Tenant to deduct $35.50 per month or 5% from the monthly
     rent until the repairs are completed if the Landlord fails to carry out
     the repairs on or before July 15, 2018. As a result, $35.50 for the months
     of August, September, October and November for a total of $142.00 will be
     deducted from the rent arrears the Tenants owe. The Landlord will be
     ordered to replace the front door and to contact the pest control
     technician again and follow through with any recommended treatments at the
     recommended times. 

 
It is ordered that:
            
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before November
19, 2018.
 
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit  plus the abatement the Landlord owes exceeds the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $250.88*.
 
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants: 
$23.34 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 9,
2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 19, 2018, then starting November 20, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 20, 2018.
 
7.     
If, on or before November
19, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,162.76** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after November 20,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
9.     
The Landlord shall replace
the front entry door on or before November 30, 2018.
 
10.  
The Landlord shall hire a
professional pest control technician to inspect and treat the rental unit for
cockroaches on or before November 22, 2018.
 
11.  
The Landlord shall follow
the recommendation of the pest control technician with regards to the number of
treatments necessary and the duration between the treatments.
 
12.  
If the Landlord fails to
replace the front door or to hire a professional pest control technician by the
specified dates in paragraphs 9 and 10 of this order, the Tenant is authorized
to deduct $35.50 per month or 5% from the monthly rent until the repairs are
completed.
 
13.  
Due to a potential Canada Post strike, the
Landlord must immediately give a copy of this Order to the Tenants by:
 
•       
handing it to the Tenants;
•       
handing it to an apparently adult person in
the rental unit;
•       
leaving it in the Tenants’ mailbox; or, 
•       
if there is no mailbox, leaving it at the
place where mail is ordinarily delivered to the Tenants; or
•       
placing a copy of the order under the door of
the rental unit or through a mail slot in the door; or
•       
if there is a fax machine where the Tenants
reside, by fax
 
The Landlord shall not use regular mail, registered mail, Xpresspost
or any courier service that is used by Canada Post to deliver the Order.
