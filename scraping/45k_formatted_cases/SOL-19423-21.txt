Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-19423-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


556
  MARY STREET HAMILTON ON L8L4X7


 




Between:


Cole Fawcett


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rodney Grattan


Tenant



 
 
 
Cole Fawcett (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rodney Grattan (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
via video conference on July 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord
and the Landlord’s legal representative, Dawn Carr attended
the hearing. At 9:43 a.m. the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
For the reasons stated at the
hearing, the Landlord’s Notice to Terminate a Tenancy at the End of the Term
(Form N8) did not have sufficient detail as to the dates that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the rent. Therefore, the Landlord’s Form N8 notice to terminate a tenancy is
defective.
 
2.    
On the notice, the Landlord indicated that the rent is due on the 1st day of each month, and then indicated that the Tenant
has paid the rent late or not at all for the following months:
 
July 2015, August 2015, October 2015
 
January 2016, February 2016 - November
2016
 
January 2017 - September 2017, November 2017
 
January 2018 - December
2018




File Number: SOL-19423-21
 
January 2019 – July 2019, September
2019 – December 2019
 
January 2020, February 2020, April 2020, June 2020 – August
2020, October 2020
– November 2020.
 
3.    
The notice does not contain
sufficient detail as to what months the rent was not paid, or the dates when the rent was paid late. For example,
it is not clear from the notice whether
the rent was not paid in July 2015, or whether it was paid
late. This can be said for all the months the Landlord has cited on
the notice. Instead, the Landlord should have made it clear that the July 2015
rent was not paid, or he should have stated the specific date the July 2015
rent was paid late. As such, the Landlord has failed to provide sufficient
detail on the notice to indicate that the Tenant has been persistently paying
the rent late.
 
4.     A tenancy cannot terminate on a defective
notice of termination.
 
5.     As I stated at the hearing, the Landlord’s application shall be dismissed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed, without
prejudice.
