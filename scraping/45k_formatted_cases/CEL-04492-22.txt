Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04492-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


605, 171 COLLIER STREET BARRIE ON L4M1H6


 




Between:


Q Residential


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Margaret Osborne
  Richard Osborne


Tenants



 
 
 
Q Residential (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Margaret Osborne and
Richard Osborne (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on December 29, 2021 with respect to application CEL- 97567-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants failed to prepare
the rental unit fully for pest control
treatment on January 7, 2022. The Tenants failed to
maintain their rental unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness as of the current
date. The Pest Control report states that the unit is cluttered with personal
belongings in the living room. Live Bed Bugs found crawling in between the
pieces of papers and in personal belongings left in the living room and stated
that the unit needs to be fully decluttered and have belongings removed and
that only 75% prepared treatment was completed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-97567-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 14, 2022.




File Number: CEL-04492-22
 
3.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February
15, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
4.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.

The tenant has until February 13, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 13, 2022
the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.
