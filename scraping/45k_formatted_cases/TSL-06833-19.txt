Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-06833-19
 










 
 

L1
Application 
 
M
H (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict H W
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
L2
Application
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex have: 
 
•        
wilfully
or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and 
 
•        
substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. 
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant or another occupant has committed and illegal act or
is carrying on an illegal business in the residential complex.
 
The
Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the
Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. 
 
This
combined L1/L2 Application was heard in Toronto on August 27, 2019.
 
Only
the Landlord attended the hearing. 
 
The
Tenant failed to attend despite the Board serving a Notice of Hearing on all
parties that indicated the time, place and purpose of the hearing. There was no
record before me of a request to adjourn. In spite of this, I waited 30
minutes. When the Tenants still failed to attend, I proceeded to determine the
application on the basis of the materials before me. 
 
Determinations:
 
L1
Application 
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2019 to August 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 17, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.      Since
the hearing, the rent for September 2019 has become due. September’s rent is
included in the amount owing in this order. If the Tenant has paid September’s
rent and/or any other amounts toward the arrears since the hearing, those
amounts should be deducted from the arrears owing in this order.
 
L2 Application 
 
N5
Notice of Termination: Substantial Interference and Damage
 
4.      I
am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant, an occupant or a
guest substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant and wilfully or
negligently damaged the residential complex by: 
 
o   Turning
off the power for the residential complex on March 4, 2017, causing the furnace
and water heater to break; 
 
o   Turning
off the power for the residential complex on January 3, 2019, causing another
tenant’s television and cable box to break; and 
 
o   Refusing
to answer the door for police on March 12, 2019, causing the police to break
down the unit door. 
 
5.      The
N5 Notice includes other allegations, which are dismissed because either the
Tenant voided them or the Landlord provided insufficient details (specifically,
dates and times) of the conduct as required by section 43 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) and the Divisional Court’s decision in Ball
v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931. 
 
6.      Pursuant
to section 89 of the Act, the Tenant is ordered to pay the Landlord the cost of
repairing and replacing the furnace, water heater and unit door. According to
an invoice the Landlord submitted from a construction company, this cost totals
$8,780. I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that this is the
reasonable cost of repairing and replacing the damaged property and the
Landlord has incurred this cost. The Landlord’s request for the cost of
replacing the other tenant’s television and cable box is denied because I find
that this is another tenant’s personal property and not part of the residential
complex or the rental unit. Therefore, this property/damage is not captured by
section 89 of the Act. 
 
N6
Notice of Termination: Illegal Act
 
7.      The
Landlord testified that on March 12, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. police had broke down
the door to the rental unit searching for drugs. The Landlord did not have the
police report for the incident. The Landlord testified that while he was told
that the Tenant was arrested, he does not know what the Tenant was charged with
or what was found during the search of the rental unit. 
 
8.      Without
any evidence before me about what transpired during this search and the basis
for the Tenant’s arrest, I cannot find that the Tenant committed an illegal
act. Therefore, the allegation in the N6 Notice of Termination is dismissed.
 
9.      In
short, the L2 Application is granted based on the allegations of substantial
interference and damage to the furnace, water heater, other tenant’s television
and the rental unit door.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Pursuant
to the L2 Application, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated, as of September 14, 2019. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before September 14, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,827.12, which includes: 
 
o   $1,047.12*
for arrears of rent to September 3, 2019 and the application filing fee; and
 
o   $8,780,
which represents the reasonable cost of repairing and replacing the damaged
furnace, water heater and rental unit door. 
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.66 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit from September 4, 2019 to the date the Tenants moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
September 14, 2019, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from September 15, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before September 14, 2019, then starting
September 15, 2019, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after September 15, 2019.
