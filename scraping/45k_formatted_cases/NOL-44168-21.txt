Favourable Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Brigette Lariviere (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Angie Gravelle, attended the hearing. As of 2:37 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October
10, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 28, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $900.00
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated effective October 28, 2021, when the Tenant
returned vacant possession of
the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $5,328.49*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 28, 2021.




File Number: NOL-44168-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
4, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
