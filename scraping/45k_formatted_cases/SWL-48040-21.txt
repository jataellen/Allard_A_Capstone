ROAD

Gailin Payette Kylie Payette Leah Payette


Tenants




 
 
 
Servico 724 Management Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Gailin
Payette, Kylie Payette and Leah Payette (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted
in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the
damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Mark Gabriel, attended the hearing. As of
1:45 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Based on the uncontested evidence and pictures
submitted at the hearing, I am satisfied that the Tenants have wilfully or negligently damaged the carpeting in the rental unit and removed or damaged the light
fixtures in the rental unit.
 
2.     Additionally, the Tenants failed to maintain the
rental unit in a reasonable state of cleanliness, stored substantial amounts of
garbage, clutter, and waste in the garage of the rental complex. This conduct has substantially interfered with the Landlord's and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. The garbage and waste creates a foul smell and attracts
rodents and other pests.

3.    
The Landlord claims damage
costs of $5,000.00. No invoices, estimates
or receipts were submitted at the hearing to prove
this claim. Therefore, this claim is denied.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $34.52
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 21, 2022 to the
date they move out of the unit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before January 31, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February
1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
