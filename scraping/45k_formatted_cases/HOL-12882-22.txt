Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12882-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


15754
  NINTH LINE STOUFFVILLE ON L4A3N4


 




Between:


Future Delight
Investment


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Roger Nice


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 24, 2022, Future
Delight Investment (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Roger
Nice (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
January 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 15, 2022, then starting
February 16, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 16, 2022.
