Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99228-22
 



In the matter
of:


3, 101 ELEVENTH STREET
EAST CORNWALL ON K6H7B8


 




Between:


Mostafa Elgazzar


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dominic Penson


Tenant



 
On January 14, 2022, Mostafa
Elgazzar (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dominic
Penson (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 23, 2021 with respect to application EAL-96933-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,000.0 on or before January
1,2022 towards rent.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears
of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$8,786.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
EAL-96933-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $7,786.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-96933-21 is cancelled.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-96933-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.

3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $8,786.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$32.88 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 12, 2022.

The tenant has until February
10, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by February 10, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
