In the
  matter of:


EAST DETACHED PPT,
8850 LAKERIDGE RD UXBRIDGE ON L9P1R3


 




Between:


Jun Ling Yin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christina Grigor
  Jeremy Hubbert


Tenants



 
 
 
Jun Ling Yin (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jeremy Hubbert and Christina Grigor (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe (L1); and because they
have been persistently late in paying their rent (L2).
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
926 3019 7558# on October
26, 2021. Only the
Landlord, represented by Rong Wei Yu, attended the hearing.
 
The Tenants had requested
an adjournment which was granted
to prepare for section 82 submissions. The Tenant did not attend.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 20, 2019 to November
19, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from June 17, 2017 to April 24, 2021.
 
4.     The Tenants have been persistently late paying rent.
 
5.     This order cannot
be voided due the persistently late payment of rent.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 13, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$23,421.68*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 2, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$73.61 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
13, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 14, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 14, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $27,069.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 14, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
