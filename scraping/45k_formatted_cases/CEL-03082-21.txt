In the
  matter of:


PH12, 1110
CAVEN STREET MISSISSAUGA ON
  L5G4N4


 




Between:


IMH POOL
XVIII LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kamal Baddad


Tenant



 
 
IMH POOL XVIII LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kamal Baddad (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed
administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Matt Anderson, attended the hearing. As of 9:57 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,081.93 as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $20.00 for administration charges
related to a cheque
tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant, which was returned NSF.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,091.66 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period from January
1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $4,289.26 after the application was filed.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $179.26*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
8, 2022 and the total charges related
to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the
Tenant, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$35.57 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 19, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,538.85** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
