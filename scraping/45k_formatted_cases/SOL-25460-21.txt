Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: SOL-25460-21



In the matter
of:


2,
407 NIAGARA STREET WELLAND ON L3C1L3


 




Between:


Joel Gauthier Justin Gauthier


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Chris Rodrigue Robert Richardson


Tenants



 
 
Joel Gauthier and Justin Gauthier
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Robert Richardson and Chris Rodrigue
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 1, 2022.
Only the Landlords and their
Legal Representative, Judith Callender, attended the hearing. As of 1:52 p.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective October 13, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in
possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $875.00.
 
4.    
The Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $875.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October 3, 2018 to October 13, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $2,725.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $497.86*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlords $28.77
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $2,201.00** to the Landlords or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during
the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
 
February 8, 2022
