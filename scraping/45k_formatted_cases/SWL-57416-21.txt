Kelsey - Rose Macdonald Kenneth Macdonald


Tenants




 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kelsey -
Rose Macdonald and Kenneth Macdonald (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have
the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on November 25, 2021 with respect to application SWL-53726-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The order provided that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
1.       
I find that the Tenants have not
met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1059.11 rent on or before December
1, 2021 they also did not
pay $300.00 arrears and costs on December 3, 2021.
 
2.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
3.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$5,373.77 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SWL-53726-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $5,373.77
and that amount
is included in this
order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-53726-21 is cancelled.
 
4.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,059.11 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period from October 1, 2020 to January 7, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order SWL-53726-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated as of January
07, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 18, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $5,616.45*. (less any payments made by the Tenant after the
application was filed on or after December 13, 2021.)This amount represents the rent owing up to January 7, 2022 and the costs
related to the application
fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$34.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 8, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 19, 2022.
 
8.       
The tenant has until January
17, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
17, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
9.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 19,
2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
