Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24693-21



In the
matter of:


304, 18 DUNDAS
STREET DUNDAS ON L9H6Z7


 




Between:


Victoria
Park Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Danita Simpson


 
Tenant



 
 
 
Victoria Park Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict
Danita Simpson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Lange, attended the hearing. As of 1:31 p.m. the Tenant was
not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Naleah Cuff is removed as a party to the application.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1,
2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 26,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $895.00.
4.    
The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $271.91 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant up to December
31, 2020.
 
6.    
The amount outstanding to December 31, 2021, inclusive of rent arrears ($3,170.00), and
costs ($186.00), is $3,356.00.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. Based on an agreement reached by the parties,
the Landlord requested an order with the conditions outlined below.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,356.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($3,170.00) and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending December 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
(a)  
The Tenant
shall make the following payments
to the Landlord in respect
of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  
The Tenant shall
also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of January 2022 up to and including May 2022 in full, on or before
the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to
make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30
days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under
paragraph 1 of this order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
