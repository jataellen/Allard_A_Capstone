Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-03751-19
 











 
 

D.L.H.I. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict C.D and W.E (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 6, 2019.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, B.R, and one of
the Tenants, CD, attended the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants owe the Landlord
$5,178.60. The Tenants have until May 24, 2019 to pay the Landlord the full
amount owing to avoid eviction. 
The Tenants owe the Landlord $5,178.60
2.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1,
2019 to May 31, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 20, 2019.
3.     
The Tenants paid $1,000.00
after the application was filed.
4.     
The Tenant, CD, did not
dispute that he owes the amount the Landlord is claiming. CD testified that he
made one payment that is not reflected in the Landlord’s calculations - $900.00
paid by e-transfer on May 1, 2019. However, the Landlord’s legal representative
advised that as of the hearing date this amount had not been received by the
Landlord. The Landlord’s legal representative advised that if/when the Landlord
receives this payment, the Landlord will adjust the amount the Tenant owes
accordingly. Therefore, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenants
owe the Landlord $5,178.60, including arrears of rent to May 31, 2019 and the
application filing fee. 
5.     
CD testified that the other
named Tenant, WE, no longer lives in the rental unit and he moved out in
December, 2017. However, WE did not present any evidence to corroborate his
claim that either he or WE gave the Landlord notice that WE was moving out.
Further, the Tenants are both listed on the tenancy agreement. Therefore, I
find that they are jointly and severally liable for the rent. Accordingly, WE
remains a party to this application. 
6.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
7.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from June 1, 2014 to February 20, 2019.
Section 82 issue 
8.     
CD testified that he has had
problems with the heat during the tenancy. I asked CD if he was ready to
proceed with a hearing of that issue and, specifically, I asked CD if he had
proof of the temperature in the rental unit on any particular days. CD
testified that he did not come to the hearing with proof of any temperature
readings from the unit. 
9.     
I told CD that he did not
have sufficient evidence to prove that the Landlord breached its maintenance
obligations under section 20(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”). Specifically, without evidence of the temperature in the unit, I
cannot determine that the Landlord violated Chapter 497 of the Municipal Code
by failing to maintain a minimum temperature of 21 degrees Celsius in the unit
between September 15 and June 1 of the following year. I note that this does
not prevent the Tenant from filing his own application in respect of this
issue. 
Section 83 considerations 
10.  
CD asked for conditional
relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan. However, I do not think
that this relief is appropriate because I did not get a true sense of the
Tenant’s financial circumstances such that I am confident that the Tenant can
adhere to his proposed plan and/or afford to pay the rent going forward.
11.  
Initially, the Tenant
testified that he was living with the mother of his child and splitting the
rent with her. The Tenant subsequently testified that he was living with a co-worker
and splitting the rent with him. Neither of these individuals attended the
hearing to attest to their living situation, whether they are contributing to
the rent, their income and/or their other monthly expenses. Due to the
contradictions in the Tenant’s evidence, I find that the information he
provided about his own financial situation unreliable. Therefore, I am not
convinced that the Tenant can afford the rent and/or the arrears. 
12.  
The Tenant asked that if I
grant the application and order termination of the tenancy, that I postpone
eviction for a month to give him time to find another place to live. However,
the Tenant also testified that as of the hearing date he had made no efforts to
find a new home. Therefore, I do not think that it would be appropriate to
postpone eviction since the reason for the extension he was requesting was his
own lack of diligence and his failure to make reasonable efforts to find a new
home, despite having ample notice of the application and hearing. 
13.  
Further, without reliable
evidence regarding his financial circumstances, I am not convinced that
postponing eviction will not result in an increase in the arrears owing.
Accordingly, I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 24,
2019.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,424.04*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 10, 2019, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $49.37 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 11, 2019 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 24, 2019, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 25,
2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 24, 2019, then starting May 25, 2019, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 25, 2019.
8.     
If, on or before May 24,
2019, the Tenants pay the amount of $5,178.60** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 25, 2019
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
