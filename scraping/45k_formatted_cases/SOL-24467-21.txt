Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SOL-24467-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
12, 5 FOREST
HILL DRIVE GUELPH ON N1G2E1


 




Between:


Guelph Campus
Cooperative


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jennifer Laing


Tenant



 
 
 
Guelph Campus Cooperative (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jennifer
Laing (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord’s Agents,
Tina Sorbara and Tom Beemink, attended the hearing. As of 11:00 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
13, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $950.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlord waives
the application filing
fee.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $9,842.07*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.23
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 20, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
7.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $10,170.47** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant
is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
