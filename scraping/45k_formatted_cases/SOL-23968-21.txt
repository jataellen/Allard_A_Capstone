Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23968-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1, 111 ALDER
STREET DUNVILLE ON N1A1C8


 




Between:


Jovo Ivekic


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Angela
Viau


Tenant



 
 
Jovo Ivekic
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Angela
Viau (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in
paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 10, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative P Balatidis attended the hearing. The Tenant did not attend the hearing
although properly served with notice of hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
served the Tenant
with a Form N8. This application is for persistently late payments.
 
2.    
In this case, the Tenant only made partial
payment in May 2021, and since June 2021
there has been no payments.
 
3.     I do not find that the
Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due,
as the Tenant has altogether not paid rent from June onwards. In situations
where the Tenant has not paid the rent, the Landlord must serve the Tenant with
a Form N4.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
