Order under Section
87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97796-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 23 BAKER STREET KINGSTON ON K7K4Z2


 




Between:


Fern Gauthier


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Akoela Edwards


Tenant



 
 
 
Fern Gauthier
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Akoela Edwards (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
in Passcode: 935 7744 5092#
on January 11, 2022.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 3:36 p.m., the Tenant was
not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1683.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $8,340.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$75.00, which represents the amount of rent owing up to January 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: EAL-97796-21
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 8, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 9, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
