Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18532-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UPPER UNIT, 1166
VENUS CRESCENT OSHAWA ON
  L1J6E4


 




Between:


Joshua Galliford
  Erica Galliford


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Kimberly Howes


Tenant



 
 
 
Joshua Galliford and Erica Galliford (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Kimberly
Howes (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant.
 
This application was heard on February
1, 2022. The Landlord, represented by Han Hao, and the Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served
an N5 notice to terminate the tenancy based on substantial interference with reasonable
enjoyment.
 
2.    
The allegations include an extension cord that was moved over a car while the grass was being cut; the Tenant’s children
hitting and damaging a car; the lower unit tenant unable to park in their spot
due the actions of the Tenant’ and her children; a recording of an argument
between the lower unit tenants that was circulated without consent, which the
Landlord alleges has caused mental anguish and significant strain. The Landlord claims the lower unit tenants
are uncomfortable being recorded.
 
3.     The Landlord introduced as evidence of video recordings of the Tenant,
the Tenant’s children and her
guests, as evidence to support the allegations in the notice.
 
4.     Recordings show a child throwing a stick in the yard, a child skipping with a hula hoop, a car parked in the driveway
of the home and then leaving, and a man pulling an extension
cord over a car while cutting the grass. The
Landlord claims these incidents damaged the
car parked outside.
Damage was not a ground
for terminating the tenancy on the N5 notice served on the Tenant. Having watched the videos and based on the
testimony

and allegations made in the N5, I find the notice does not support the allegation of substantial interference with
reasonable enjoyment.
 
5.    
The Landlord argues there were additional issues after the N5 was served. Considering the fact that the N5 notice was insufficient to terminate the tenancy, the application must be dismissed. There was also no evidence that the Tenant did not
remedy the notice in the seven days after the notice was served and thus
voided the notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords' application is dismissed.
