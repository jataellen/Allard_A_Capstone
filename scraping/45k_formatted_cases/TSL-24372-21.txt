Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24372-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


301, 30 SPRINGHURST AVENUE TORONTO ON M6K1B3


 




Between:


Janwalk Investments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Anthony David Bowring


Tenant



 
 
Janwalk Investments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Anthony David Bowring (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sean Beard, attended the hearing. As of 11:04 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September
3, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $901.92
as of January 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $894.55 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenant for the period
from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 30, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,153.66*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 19, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.65
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 20, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 31, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 30, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $6,572.74** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
31, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
January 19, 2022                                                                                     Date Issued                                                                           Richard
