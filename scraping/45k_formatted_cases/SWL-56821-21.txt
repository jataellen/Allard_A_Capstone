Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56821-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


29, 585 MILL STREET WINDSOR ON N9C2R7


 




Between:


Ibrahim Georges Samira Georges


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Dawood Aoea Oshana


Tenant



 
 
 
Ibrahim Georges and Samira
Georges (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dawood
Aoea Oshana (the 'Tenant') because
they intend to do major repairs
or renovations to the rental unit. The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
The hearing was held by videoconference on January 10th, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s son, Winsam Georges
and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Melissa Bradley attended the hearing. The
Landlord’s son gave evidence on the Landlord’s behalf.
 
The Tenant had initially attended the hearing
however, he advised
the Board that he required
an Arabic interpreter. Noting that the Tenant had never made a request
for an interpreter, I had advised the Tenant that he could have a friend of
family member call-in to assist with interpretation which he left
the hearing in order to do so. By 3:46
pm, the Tenant never returned
to the hearing and the application proceeded in his absence.
 
Landlord’s Son’s Evidence
 
1.     
The complex in question
is a 30-unit complex that is 30 years old. The complex
contains 3 floors containing 10 units per floor with a shared kitchen
for each floor. Each unit contains its own bathroom.
 
2.     
As the result of an accident
that occurred in June 2021, extensive damage had occurred to 4 units which caused the City
of Windsor to issue an Unsafe Order. This order was never filed as evidence.
 
3.     
This incident
caused the Landlords to rethink their ownership of the building. The Landlord’s son testified that the accident
caused his parents
a lot of mental anguish




 
which led them to decide to either conduct
extensive renovations of the complex,
or to sell.
 
4.     
The Landlords had hired
a realtor and have received
only one offer to purchase however, the sale is conditional
on vacant possession of the entire complex by
February 1st, 2022. He provided further evidence that should
the sale of the complex fall though, that he would have to hire a project
manager for the renovations. He also advised that the purchasers may also
renovate the building, as well.
 
5.     
Only 6 tenants remain in the rental complex,
the Tenant is one of those 6The Landlord’s
son described the remaining Tenants as
having requested unreasonable compensation to leave the complex and have made
the process difficult for his parents.
 
6.     
The Landlord’s son testified that
the complex requires extensive renovations including replacement of the heating
system from electricity to either a forced air gas or boiler system which would
require the complex’s electricity to be turned off for a significant amount of time. He also testified that the complex
will also be installed
with a hot water line,
bathrooms and kitchens will be updated among other repairs.
 
7.     
The Landlord has not submitted any
building permits from the City of Windsor. The Landlord’s son testified that he is unable to get any permits without
first being able to
have free and open access to the units. He requires access to conduct
exploratory demolition of the complex to determine the scope of work.
 
8.     
He requires free and open access to all the units, including
the Tenant’s unit to allow for an estimator access
to the building and to be able create drawings
for the scope of work. Once the drawings are completed,
then applications for permits with the City will be made.
 
9.     
The Landlord’s son testified that he has yet to hire a contractor, but that he had one or
two in mind who he had worked with in the past.
 
10.   Further, the Landlord’s son testified that the rent
for the Tenant’s unit is $450. He acknowledges that he must pay the Tenant
$1350 for compensation as required under section 54 of the Residential
Tenancies Act (the “Act”) but has not done so yet, as the Tenant has not agreed
to move. He testified that he would pay the compensation prior to
the Termination date once the Tenant is evicted.
 
11.   For the following reasons, the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
Reasons
 
12.  
I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord
has not taken reasonable steps
to obtain permits for the renovations pursuant to s. 73(1)(b)(ii) of the
Act.




 
13.  
No documentary evidence was ever tendered
to support the testimony of the Landlord’s son that no permits could be
obtained, or any other exploratory work could have taken place without vacant
possession of the complex.
 
14.   Some evidence from the City of Windsor’s Building
Department could have supported this assertion or even some evidence from a contractor however, no contractor has even been hired
for this work by the Landlord.
 
15.  
The Landlord’s
Legal Representative had asked me to consider the cases of Two Clarendon Apartments Limited v. Sinclair
(2019) ONCS 3845, as well as TSL-04695-19 and TSL-04702-19 but this
case can be distinguished from the cited cases, as those cases involved
demolition permits where contractors were hired.
 
16.   I am further confused about the Landlord’s true
intentions with the complex. The Landlord has applied to the Board for the
eviction of the Tenant for renovations but has also sold the complex
conditional on vacant
possession. The Landlord’s son testified that the new owner may also conduct the
same renovations or the ones that he described in his evidence. The Landlords
are bringing these applications prematurely without knowing
entirely what their plan for the building is. The purchasers never attended the
hearing, and no Agreement of Purchase and Sale was ever submitted as evidence.
 
17.  
As such, I am not satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord’s application was made in good faith.
 
It is ordered that:
 
18.  
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
