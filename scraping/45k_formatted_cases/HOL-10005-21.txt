226 CRAFTER CRESCENT STONEY CREEK ON L8J0J1


 




Between:


Nawab Mohammed Abul Khan


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wajdi
  Mashaleh


Tenant



 
 
 
Nawab Mohammed Abul Khan (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wajdi Mashaleh (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
 
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on September 1, 2021 at 9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord, represented by Rajesh
Kumar, a Lawyer,
and the Tenant, represented by Kimberly
Farrell, a licensed Paralegal, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
This is a “N12”, a
notice to End you Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family Member
Requires the Rental
Unit – L2 Application to End a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant because with a termination date
of April 15, 2021
 
2.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
an N12 Notice of Termination under section 48 of the Act because he wants to move into the
rental unit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit when the application was
filed.
 
4.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$2,030.00
 
5.    
The rent is
due on the 15th day of each month.
 
6.    
The N12 notice was served on the Tenant,
via email, on March 15, 2021




File Number: HOL-10005-21
 
7.    
The application is
dismissed because the Landlord did not pay the Tenants the compensation required
for this application under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”).
 
8.    
Section 48.1 of the Act
states that, “a landlord shall compensate a tenant in the amount equal to one month’s
rent or offer the tenant another rental
unit acceptable to the tenant if
the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy under
section 48”.
 
9.    
Section 55.1 of the Act
requires that compensation under section 48.1 be paid to the tenant no later
than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination. In the
present case, the termination date in the N12 Notice
of Termination is January 31, 2022.
 
10.  At the hearing the Landlord was unable to
confirm that paid the Tenants any compensation under section 48.1. Therefore, I
find that the Landlord has not satisfied a statutory requirement for this application and the application must therefore be dismissed.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed.
