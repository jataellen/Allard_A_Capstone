Review Order
 
P. M. L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict N. A.D. A. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes and has been persistently late paying
the rent.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-89392-18
issued on May 17, 2018 and amended on May 25, 2018.
 
On May 25, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the
order.
 
The request was heard in Toronto on June 1, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, D.
C., and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Request
for Review
1.    
The sole ground for the
request for review is that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in
the hearing held on May 15, 2018.
2.    
The Tenant testified that
due to his stressful home life of losing his job, his wife being very ill and
the eviction proceedings against him he became overwhelmed and drank the night
before the hearing.  He had planned on attending, however; slept through the
hearing and did not realized until it was too late.
3.    
The Landlord opposed the
request for review stating the Tenant provided no proof of his statements and
the Tenant’s excuse is just lame.
4.    
In King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments Ltd., [2008] O.J. No. 4697 (Ont. Div. Ct.) the tenant
did not attend the hearing because she misread the notice of hearing and got
the dates mixed up. The Divisional Court ruled the Board should have granted
her request to review on the grounds of not reasonably able to participate
because the tenant genuinely intended all along to participate and otherwise
she would be denied the right to be heard. The Court stated: “Being reasonably
able to participate in the proceeding must be interpreted broadly, natural
justice requires no less.” 
5.    
9. The Court’s decision in King-Winton
v. Doverhold Investments Ltd. is binding on the Board. As I am satisfied
the Tenant genuinely intended to participate in the hearing I believe the
request for review must be granted. 
Application
for Non-payment of Rent
6.    
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2017
to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 28, 2018.
7.    
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,140.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 15, 2016 to February 28,
2018.
9.    
The Tenant paid $1,157.00
after the application was filed.
10.  The Tenant testified that he lost his job, but
is now working again and can make payments towards the arrears of rent in the
amount of $300.00 or $400.00 a month along with the monthly rent.  This
repayment plan would take approximately 12 to 16 months to complete.  
11.  The Landlord argued that the Tenant has not
provided any evidence as proof of work or how much income he has to support
this repayment plan.  The Tenant stated he worked for a man with the nickname
‘Easy’, but when we called this individual during the hearing to obtain
confirmation of his employment this person said he did not know the Tenant.
Application
for Persistently Late Rent
12.  The Landlord submitted a copy of the Tenant’s
ledger, which shows late payments as well at the Notice of Termination.  The
rent is due on the first day of each month and the Tenant has not paid on time
going back as far as April 2017.
13.  Given the lack of evidence from the Tenant to
support his claim that he can make payments, the fact that nothing has been
paid by the Tenant since March 12, 2018, and the Landlord’s supporting evidence
of persistently late payments, I find a remedial order is not likely to change
the Tenant’s behaviour regarding the paying on time or that he has the
resources to pay the arrears.  
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
15.  This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-89392-18 issued on
May 17, 2018 and amended May 25, 2018, is cancelled and replaced by the
following: 
2.    
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before July 7, 2018.
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,272.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to June 25, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $38.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
June 26, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 6, 2018, then starting July 7, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 7, 2018.
