Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
SOL-25371-21
 



In the matter
of:


45 CHESTNUT STREET
E
ST. CATHARINES ON L2T1G9


 




Between:


Carrie Lieberman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Deb May Nick Lambert


Tenants



 
 
 
Carrie Lieberman
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Deb May
and Nick Lambert (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference
on February 1, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sidney Sheridan,
attended the hearing. As of 10:20 a.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from October 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,000.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 3, 2021 to October 17, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $5,213.06*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February
8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$65.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $8,786.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
