In the matter
of:

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Stone


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
 
Rosa D'Amata (RD) and Antonio D'Amata
(AD) (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Robert Stone (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The
Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-32472-21 issued on November
8, 2021.
 
On November 16, 2021, the Tenant requested
a review of the order and that the order be stayed until the request to review the
order is resolved.
 
On November 18, 2021 interim order TNL-32472-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on November 8, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on January 31, 2022.
 
The Landlord RD, the Landlords’ legal
representative J. Shabes,
and the Tenant’s
legal representative T. Sivapatham attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Prior to the hearing, the Tenant did not request
that this review
hearing be rescheduled.
 
2.     At the review hearing, the Tenant’s legal
representative stated that he did not have instructions to request an adjournment. He offered some reasons why the Tenant was not present, including that the Tenant
was recovering from a vaccination that he received on




File Number: TNL-32472-21-RV
 
January 28, 2022 and that the Tenant’s partner
had recently tested
positive for COVID- 19.
 
3.     The Tenant’s legal
representative’s speculations on why the Tenant is not present
are not sufficient to
constitute a request for an adjournment.
 
4.     The Tenant’s legal representative did not have instructions to conduct the Tenant’s
request for a review in the Tenant’s absence.
 
5.     Since the Tenant
did not appear
at the hearing to support
the review request, I find that this review request has been
abandoned.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order
TNL-32472-21 issued on November 8, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on November 18, 2021 is cancelled. The stay of order TNL- 32472-21 is lifted on February 14,
2022.
