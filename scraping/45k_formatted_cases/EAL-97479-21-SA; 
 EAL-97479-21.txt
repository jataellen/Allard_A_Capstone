Jumana

Tenant



 
 
Q Res IV Operating
GP Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jumana Mustafa (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent he owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on August 17, 2021 with respect to application EAL-95625-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order EAL-97479-21, issued on September
15, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order EAL-97479-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on December 21, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s agent,
T. Shaw, and the Landlord’s legal representative, S. Korman, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
did not attend the hearing
scheduled for 1 p.m. I waited until 1:35 p.m.,
and then I proceeded to hear the matter on an uncontested basis.
 
2.    
Since the Tenant did not attend the hearing
to support his motion, I find that the Tenant has abandoned their set aside
motion.
 
3.    
The Landlord
requested their costs pursuant to Rule 23 of the Board’s Rules
of Procedure.
 
4.    
The Landlord
said that the original order EAL-95625-21 was mediated
at the hearing on August
10, 2021, with $6,388.14 of arrears owing. The
Landlord also said that the payments to repay the arrears
owing were supposed
to take place
between August and December 2021.
 
5.    
The Landlord
submits that the Tenant made none of the payments
that had been agreed,
and the arrears are now $11,277.98 to the end of December, 2021. The Landlord submits that the Tenant has
engaged in an abuse of process by filing the set aside motion in order to delay
eviction, and live rent-free.




 
 
 
6.    
The Landlord
requests $260.00 for preparing for the motion
and attending the hearing.
 
7.    
Pursuant to Rule 23.3
of the Board’s Rules of Procedure, a “party who engages in unreasonable conduct
which causes undue delay or expense may be ordered
to pay costs to another
party.”
 
8.    
The Board’s
Interpretation Guideline 3 provides that conduct is unreasonable if it causes undue expense or delay, and it
includes, bringing a frivolous or vexatious application or motion, or
initiating an application or any procedure in bad faith.
 
9.    
The Tenant negotiated a
mediated agreement on August 10, 2021, and immediately breached the agreement
on the first scheduled payment. The
Landlord obtained an ex parte eviction order on the basis of the breach,
and the Tenant then filed a motion to set aside the eviction.
 
10.  The Landlord filed the eviction
order with the sheriff, and they were then prevented
from evicting the Tenant for a
further three months before the hearing. The Landlord’s agent
and legal representative prepared for the set aside motion, and they attended
the set aside motion. The Tenant
chose not to attend.
 
11.  Consequently, I find that the Tenant’s
actions prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the set aside motion was
either frivolous or vexatious, or it was launched in bad faith in order to delay the eviction and live without
paying rent, or making any payments towards the increasing arrears. The Tenant now owes almost double what
they owed in August, 2021, and the Landlord has been prejudiced by the delay.
 
12.  I find that the Landlord
has justified its allegation that the Tenant’s
conduct was unreasonable, and
they will be awarded $260.00 costs.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order EAL-97479-21, issued on September 15, 2021, is denied.
 
2.    
The stay of order EAL-97479-21 is lifted immediately.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay the Landlord $260.00
costs.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
January 22, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
