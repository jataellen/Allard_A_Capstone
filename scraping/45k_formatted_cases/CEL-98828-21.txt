IMH Pool IV LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dana Matei
and Andreea Matei (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Mathew,
attended the hearing.
As of 9:35 a.m. the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears,
the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February
9, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on June 30, 2021.

rent was $2,249.42.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $8,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.

collected a rent deposit of $2,249.42 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenants up to December
31, 2020.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The
tenancy is terminated as of June 30, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$229.83*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to June 30,
2021, less the rent deposit.

for the cost of filing the application.

full amount owing* on or before February 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
