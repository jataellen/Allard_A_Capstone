In the matter
of:


305, 3 GOLDFINCH COURT TORONTO ON M2R2C1


 




Between:


Q Res IV Operating GP Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Aram Grigoryan


Tenant



 
 
 
Q Res IV Operating GP Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Aram Grigoryan (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 29, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Bryan Rubin, attended the
hearing. As of 10:38 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective August 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful
monthly rent is $1,639.03.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,569.92 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2020
to August 19, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
December 31, 2021 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$5,328.63*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January
4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to
the Landlord $53.89 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 5, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,459.21** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain
in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
16, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
