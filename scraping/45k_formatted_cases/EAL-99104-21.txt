On December 10, 2021, District Realty In Trust (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Germaine Lowe (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 12, 2021
with respect to application EAL-96174-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:

to pay to the Landlord
the lawful rent on or before December
1, 2021.

The Tenant
was ordered to pay $1,974.08 for rent arrears
in Order EAL-96174-21. The Tenant has paid the full amount owing from that order.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $795.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit
for the amount of $87.55 is
owing to the Tenant for the period from May 27, 2014 to January 17,
2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-96174-21 is cancelled.

or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
