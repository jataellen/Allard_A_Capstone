Review Order
 
Metcap Living Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Luz Ofelia Giraldo and Jhon
Palacio (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-28887-20 issued on August
16, 2021.
 
On November 3, 2021, the Tenants
requested a review
of the order because the Tenants’
Representative (who is an occupant of the rental unit) was not able to
participate in the proceedings as the Representative was out of the country on
the date of the hearing.
 
On November 5, 2021, the Board
issued interim order
TNL-28887-20 staying the order issued
on August 16, 2021.
 
The Tenants’ request was heard
by way of video conference on January 25, 2022. The Tenants’ Representative (spouse),
Israel Sosa, the Tenants’ Agent, Ricardo Colonnese and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sara
Matthew attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues
 
The Tenants submitted in writing
to the Board that Israel Sosa (‘IS’) is authorized to represent their interest
at the hearing. IS is the
spouse of the Tenant, Luz Ofelia
Giraldo. IS also lives in the rental unit.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenants’ Request to Review




 
1.       
IS testified that on the date of hearing,
May 10, 2021, he did not attend
because he was out of the
country tending to his mother who was ill. IS
testified that he had difficulty returning to Canada due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. He only returned
to Canada on October 16, 2021.
 
2.       
IS testified that he represents his spouse in most matters
as she has difficulty speaking English. Further, his spouse was also out of the country at the time of the hearing and had difficulty
returning due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
3.       
IS testified that because
both he and his spouse were out of the country when the Notice of Hearing was mailed, they did not
receive it until their return to Canada in October 2021.
 
4.       
The Tenants’ Agent submitted that IS’ evidence
is clear that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing.
 
5.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted
that IS’ evidence
is reasonable as to why the
Tenants could not participate in the hearing.
 
Findings
 
6.       
Based on the uncontested evidence
before me, I am satisfied that the Tenants were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing. I say this because the Tenants and IS were
out of country when the Notice of Hearing was mailed to their rental unit and
on the date of the hearing. The Tenants had no idea a hearing was scheduled.
 
7.       
The Tenants’ request to review the order is granted.
 
New Hearing
of Landlord’s L1 Application
 
8.       
The Tenants have not paid the
total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 26, 2020.
 
9.       
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
10.    The lawful monthly
rent is $$1,077.10.
 
11.    The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $894.87
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
12.    Interest on the rent
deposit is owing
to the Tenants for the period
from January 1, 2020 to October 26, 2020.
 
13.    The Tenants paid $7,178.87 after the application was filed.
 
14.    The parties agreed the amount
owed to the Landlord
is $11,132.93 which is inclusive
of arrears of rent ($10,946.93) and the cost ($186.00) for filing the
application.




 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
15.   
The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the Landlord has reached out to the Tenants by way of letter on
October 7, 2020 and October 27, 2020 requesting a repayment plan for the arrears of rent. The Tenants never responded to the Landlord’s request.
 
16.    The Landlord’s Representative submitted that the Landlord cannot
accept a payment
plan longer than 6 months. Later
in the hearing, during closing submissions, the Landlord’s Representative
submitted that if the Board grants relief by way of payment plan, it is the
Landlord’s request that the plan be less than 2 years in length.
 
17.   
The Landlord’s Representative further
submitted that since early 2020 the Tenants
have consistently been in arrears of rent. As such, the Landlord
requires assurance that the Tenants will pay the arrears of rent and the
monthly rent.
 
Tenants’ Evidence
 
18.   
IS testified that because
of the impact of COVID-19,
he lost his job in 2020. His income
was insufficient to pay the monthly rent.
 
19.    IS testified that since November
2021, he has been gainfully
employed and can afford to pay the monthly rent plus $600.00 a
month for the arrears of rent. This
translates to an 18-month payment plan.
 
20.    IS testified that he and his family would have no place
to go if they were evicted. They want to stay in the rental unit. IS advised that the household monthly
income is approximately $4,100.00 to $4,600.00.
 
21.   
The Tenant’s Agent submitted that
relief from eviction by way of payment plan has minimal prejudice to the
Landlord as they would receive repayment of the arrears of rent and the monthly rent in full. Further, if the Tenants
default on the payments, the Landlord
could rely on section 78 of the Act to evict the Tenants.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
22.   
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a)
and 204(1) of the Act. In making my finding,
I considered the fact that the Tenants’ proposed repayment plan
is reasonable and is less than two years as requested by the Landlord’s
Representative. Further, should the
Tenants default in making any of the payments, including the monthly rent, the
Landlord can apply to the Board under section 78 to evict the Tenants. I am satisfied in this matter that relief
from eviction by way of a payment plan is the most just and fair decision.
 
It is ordered that:




 
1.       
The Tenants’ request to review the order is granted.
 
2.       
Order TNL-28887-20 issued on August 16, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
3.       
The Tenants owe the Landlord the amount of $11,132.93 which
represents rent owing to
January 31, 2022 and the cost to the Landlord to file this application with the
Board.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the total amount
owing as follows:
 
a)     Starting February 1, 2022,
through to and including August
1, 2023, the Tenants shall pay $600.00 each month on or before
the 1st day of the month.
 
b)    
On September 1, 2023, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
the final arrears

of $332.93.
 
c)     
The Tenants
shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months February 2022 up to and including September 2023 in full, on
or before the 1st day of each
corresponding month.
 
5.       
If the Tenants fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph
4, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a) The
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants,
and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already
ordered under paragraph 2 of this order. The Landlord must make the application
