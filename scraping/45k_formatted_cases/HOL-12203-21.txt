104, 3 CANDLEWOOD DRIVE GUELPH ON N1K0E1


 




Between:


Galaxy Real
Estate Core Ontario Properties LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nazim Deen


Tenant



 
 
 
Galaxy Real Estate Core Ontario
Properties LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Nazim
Deen (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Stephanie
Lauersen, attended the hearing. As of 9:59 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective June 28, 2020
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January 1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $1,917.51.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,894.78 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
January 1, 2022.
 
7.     The Landlord’s claim for the period ending January 31, 2022 exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. The Landlord indicated
a desire to proceed with the




 
hearing of the application and voluntarily waived the portion
of the claim that exceeds
the Board’s monetary jurisdiction.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.    
As of January 24, 2022, the Tenant owes the Landlord
$37,224.94*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 24,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
The Board is only authorized to order the Tenant to pay
the maximum of its monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00. Therefore, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the maximum amount of $35,000.00.
 
3.    
The Tenant would normally
have to pay to the Landlord $63.04
per day for compensation
for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves
out of the unit. Having exceeded the
Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00 this amount of daily compensation
shall not be ordered.
 
4.     The Tenant would normally also have to pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application. Having exceeded the
Board’s monetary jurisdiction of $35,000.00 the cost of filing the application
shall not be awarded.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.     If the Tenant
wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust
the maximum amount of $35,000.00 on or before February 04, 2022. (If the Board’s monetary jurisdiction had
not been limited to
$35,000.00 the Tenant would
have to pay the following amount to continue
the tenancy:
i)       
$39,712.17 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)      
$41,629.68 if the payment is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.)
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the




 
appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 5, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
