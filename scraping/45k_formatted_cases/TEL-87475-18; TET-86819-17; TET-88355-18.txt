Landlord’s L1 application.
The B. G. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S. C. J. and P. J. (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
T. B. G. (the 'Landlord')
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S. C. J. and P. J.
(the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.
 
Tenants T2 application.
S. C. J. and P. J.(the
'Tenants') applied for an order determining that T. B. G. (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened or interfered with them and substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants
or by a member of their household.
 
Tenants T6 application.
S. C. J. and P. J. (the
'Tenants') also applied for an order determining that T. B. G.(the 'Landlord')
failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety,
housing or maintenance standards.
 
These applications were heard
in Whitby on April 27, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s agent T. T., the
Tenants and their representative P. M. attended the hearing.
 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from December 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 8, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,550.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from April 27, 2015 to January 8, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants also attempted
to raise an issue under section 82 of the Act with respect to the lack of last
months rental deposit but the Landlord pointed out that they did agree that
there was a deposit in place and that matter died. 
5.     
The Tenants have paid
$1,565.50 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until May 31, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act.
7.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application, this
part of the application was based on an N5 notice that was given to the Tenants
on December 22, 2017 with a termination date of January 8, 2018.
8.     
This is a total of 17 days
while the Act states that it must be a minimum of 20 days.
9.     
As a result the notice was
found to be void and was dismissed without prejudice.
10.  
Under the L2 application the
Landlord also requested damages but was unable to provide sufficient evidence
as to what the problems were and what the costs were and this matter too was
dismissed.
11.  
With respect to the Tenants
T2 application, the Tenant
raised two main issues.
12.  
The first was over noise
complaints that they had against others who also live in the rental complex.
13.  
The Tenants in this
application actually have other tenants living both above and below them.
14.  
Starting in October of 2017
the Tenants started experiencing higher amounts of noise complaints about the
other tenants and informed the Landlord of the issues.
15.  
As far as the Tenants are
aware there has been no action taken.
16.  
The Landlord claims that he
was well aware of the complaints from all parties and was doing his own
investigation.
17.  
The problem with this is the
Landlord has never told the Tenants what is going on and in fact the only
action the Landlord actually took was to give the Tenants an n5 notice which
was dismissed as above.
18.  
One of the other parties
involved is also related to the Landlord which makes the lack of transparency
even worse.
19.  
It is clear that all parties
are having problems with each other but it was also clear to me that the
Landlord had made his mind up as to who to get rid of and no further
information was given to them
20.  
This is not right and I have
therefore assessed a 5% rental abatement against the Landlord for the months of
October through to April.
21.  
This then is 7 x 5% x
$1,565.50 = $547.93.
22.  
The other issue that the
Tenants raised in the T2 application dealt with a heating issue however they
were unable to provide any evidence of any problems encountered and therefore
this matter was dismissed.
23.  
Therefore, I find that the
Landlord interfered with the Tenants and substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants
or by a member of their household.
24.  
With respect to the Tenants
T6 application, the only matter
here was over what the Tenants referred to as a flood of the lower area however
again no evidence of how this affected them was produced.
25.  
The Landlord agreed that
there had been a water pipe issue that had been quickly repaired and that the
Tenants were not affected in anyway.
26.  
As there was no evidence of
how the Tenants could have been affected this matter was dismissed.
27.   The Reasons contained in this order constitute
all of the reasons used in making my decision.
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 31,
2018.The amount of $1,565.50 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,467.74*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 9, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenants.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $51.47 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 10, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
The Landlord will credit to
the Tenants the sum of $547.93 as a rental abatement for the Tenants
applications.
6.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 31, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 1,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 31, 2018, then starting June 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 1, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before May 31,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $7,469.57** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.  
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 1, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
11.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $1,565.50 together with any accrued interest. **
