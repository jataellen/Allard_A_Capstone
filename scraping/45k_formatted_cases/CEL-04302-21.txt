Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


207, 195 KENNEDY
ROAD S BRAMPTON ON L6W3H2


 




Between:


Ranee Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mark Kerr


Tenant



 
 
Ranee Management (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Mark Kerr (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the mediated
settlement issued by the Board on August 9, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-00615-21.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 17, 2022 at
9:35am.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Ilana Glickman.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application was filed pursuant
to section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). Applications of this
nature normally result in the Board issuing an eviction order without a hearing.
However, this application was sent to a hearing because of a discrepancy with
the payments received by the Landlord.
 
L4 APPLICATION
2.    
The order issued on consent
provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if they
did not meet certain conditions specified in the settlement.
 
3.     At the hearing, the Landlord testified that as of the
date of the L4 application (December 1, 2021), the Tenant had failed to make the payment of $2,200.00 on or before November 30, 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord further
testified that the Tenant never achieved a zero balance
or paid off the arrears between the date of the
original hearing on July 26, 2021 to the date of the hearing of the L4
application (February 17, 2022).




 
5.    
Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I find that the Tenant was in breach of the order dated August 9, 2021;
specifically, the Tenant failed to pay $2,200.00 on or before November 30,
2021.
 
6.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
7.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $13,243.18 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
CEL-00615-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $9,542.48 and that amount is included in this order. As a
result, the previous order CEL-00615-21 is cancelled.
 
8.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
9.     The Landlord seeks
an order terminating the tenancy and an order
for the outstanding arrears.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that
would justify relief from eviction.
 
11.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,374.30
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
12.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.
 
13.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $16,413.28*. This
amount represents the rent arrears and costs owing up to
February 28, 2022, less the rent
deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$45.18 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 11, 2022, the Tenant will start to
owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 12, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 11, 2022, then starting
March 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.
 
February 28,
2022
