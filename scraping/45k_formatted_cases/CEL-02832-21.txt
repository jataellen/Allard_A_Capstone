Termination effective September 17, 2021.

The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
November 14, 2021.
The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.

rent was $4,200.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $4,200.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.

Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from August 16, 2018 to September 17, 2021.
