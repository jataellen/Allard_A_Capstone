Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57732-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


4, 683 CORONATION BOULEVARD CAMBRIDGE ON N1R3G5


 




Between:


William Poje


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lora (Laura) Winter


Tenant



 
 
 
William Poje (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lora (Laura)
Winter (the 'Tenant') and for
an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
January 13, 2022 with respect to application SWL-53489-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1400.00 rent
on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $16,196.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-53489-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $16,196.00 and that amount is included in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-53489-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,400.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 1, 2020 to February
24, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-53489-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 7, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$15,899.27*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 24, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 25, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 7, 2022, then starting March
8, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 8, 2022.
 
 
February 24, 2022

The tenant has until March 6, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If
the tenant files the motion by March 6, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
