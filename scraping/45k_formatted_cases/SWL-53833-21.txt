of:


205, 80 KING
EDWARD AVENUE LONDON ON
  N5Z3S9


 




Between:


King Edward
Apartments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kyle Page Lacey Wease


Tenants



 
 
 
King Edward Apartments (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kyle Page and Lacey Wease (the 'Tenants') The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 1, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s agent,
Kasandra Jang (‘KJ’), attended the hearing. As of 11:05 a.m. the Tenants were
not present or represented although properly served with the notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application claims the Tenants
substantially interfered with the Landlord or another tenant’s reasonable
enjoyment and/or lawful right, privilege or interest, and is based on two N5
notices of termination. The first N5 was served on the Tenants on July 30, 2021
whereas the second N5 was served on August 19, 2021. The Landlord’s N5 notices
clearly notify the Tenants of multiple disturbances and interferences on cited
dates July 30, 2021 (the first N5), and between
August 3, 2021 and August
11, 2021 (the second N5): continual fighting, loud
noises, screaming, banging, smoking, leaving unattended syringes, and broken
glass in a common area.
 
2.    
KJ testified about the complaints
she received and about the events alleged
in the two notices of termination.
 
3.    
It was KJ’s evidence
that on July 30, 2021 the Tenants
were fighting. On that date they
were yelling, banging on other residents’ doors, thus disturbing other residents.
The Landlord received multiple complaints from other residents and the Police were called.
 
4.     The Landlord’s evidence was that the disturbances
continued after July 30, 2021. As indicated in the second N5 notice, fighting
and loud noise continued on at least two more occasions: on August 3, 2021 and on
August 9, 2021. The Landlord again received




 
complaints about loud noises,
yelling, banging and fighting. The Landlord also received complaints about smoking in common areas on multiple
occasions and about the Tenants leaving unattended broken glass
and syringes in the hallway between August 5, 2021 and August 9, 2021.
 
5.     KJ testified that the noise and the smoking seriously
affected other residents and interfered with the Landlord’s rights as the
Landlord received multiple complaints from other tenants who were continuously
disturbed by the Tenants. One of the Tenants was arrested as a result
of one of the incidents. The Landlord argued
that leaving unattended broken glass and syringes
in the hallway seriously endangered other residents, including children.
 
6.    
Based on KJ’s uncontested
testimony and the submissions adduced, I find that on a balance of
probabilities the Tenants substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment and/or the lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant in the residential building.
While KJ didn’t
have first-hand knowledge
of the events alleged in the notices, her testimony was accompanied
by documentary evidence and I have no reason to doubt the credibility or
reliability of KJ’s evidence despite it being based in part on hearsay.
 
7.     KJ testified that the Tenants’ conduct has not
improved and that the Landlord continues to
receive noise and disturbance complaints regarding the Tenants
from other residents.
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
9.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,450.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
10.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1, 2021 to
August 27, 2021.
 
11.  As of the date of the hearing the Tenants had not made
any payments for rent after the termination date of August 28, 2021 noted in
the second notice of termination. I am therefore awarding per diem compensation
for every day the rental unit was occupied after August 28, 2021. Any rent
payments for the period starting
August 28, 2021 made by the Tenants
after the date of the hearing are to be subtracted from the amount owing
calculated below.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 21, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,510.54, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from August 28, 2021 to February 10, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$47.67 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 11, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 21, 2022, then
starting February 22, 2022,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 22, 2022.
