Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35729-19
 
 
 
LD (the 'Tenant') applied for an
order determining that RVPI, HD and JD and RVPI (the 'Landlords') failed to
meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are
obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on June 16,
2021 in VC75 and on July 22, 2021 in Passcode 215 965
491 VC 75. Only the Tenant and the
Tenant’s representative, (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 16, 2021 and only the
Tenant’s representative, AB-S, attended
the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16
related tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park and certain maintenance and repair issues
leading up to the time of the
effective shut down. The park was
known as RVP (the ‘Park’)
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my determinations on the liability of the
Landlords pertaining to events leading up to the Park’s closure and the
availability of remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a
multi-tenant T2 application brought
on behalf of fifteen
tenants identified in Schedule 1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief for
the discontinuance of power to the Park. A
separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the
fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and inactions
pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and the
effective closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35710-19 is one
of those applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded
to completion on July 22,
2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number
NOT-35707-19 proceeded on June 2, 2019. The procedural history
is set out in the Compendium Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in order NOT-33990-18-HR, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s water
system such that the supply of potable water was compromised
for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)    
The above failures, combined with
the Landlords’ decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018, attract various
remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October 2018 effective closure and
pertaining to events following that effective closure.
 
2.    The Tenant claims for two classes of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing
of the Landlords prior to the Park’s effective closure in October 2018; and
second; those attributable to the closure.
 
3.   
I
find the following
facts on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant;
 
a)     The Tenant had lived at the Park for four years before
she vacated in November 2018 following the effective closure of the Park;
 
b)     The Tenant paid rent of $240.00 per month at the Park up to and including September 2018;
 
c)     
The Tenant
contributed $55.00 towards
the cost of repairing a transformer in the Park in 2018;
 
d)     The Tenant was negatively affected
by the sewage issues, but less so by the water problems, as she was accustomed to
buying bottled water;




 
e)    
The uncertainty associated with the potential closure of the Park
caused the Tenant considerable anxiety in the period leading up to her
departure from the Park;
 
f)       The Tenant’s new rent was $131.70 higher per month than the Park rent.
 
First Type of Remedies
- for the Period Prior
to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I
have considered compensation for events occurring between March 15, 2018, being one year prior to
when this application was filed, and
October 31, 2018.
 
5.    I find that the Tenant is entitled to a rebate of
$156.00, being 10% of the of the $240.00 monthly rent which she paid at the
Park for the 6 ½ month period from mid-March 2018 through September 2018 for the impacts
of the Landlords’ failure to maintain or repair the sewage system.
 
6.   
I
find that the Tenant is entitled to $55.00 in compensation for her contribution to the costs of the transformer repair in 2018.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
7.   
For the second type of remedies,
as set out in the Base Order, I find
the following:
 
a)    
The Tenant is entitled
to compensation for the increased costs of rent,
over and above the rental rate at the Park, for
the period from when she vacated the Park to July 31, 2019; and
 
b)    
The Tenant may be entitled to compensation for mental distress.
 
8.    I find that the Tenant is entitled
to payment of $1,053.60 for the $131.70 increase in rent for a period
of 8 months.
 
9.    I find that the Tenant
suffered some anxiety during the period leading
up to her departure from
the Park and find that an additional award of $1,000.00 is warranted for mental
distress.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant a total of $2,264.60, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $156 for the impacts
of the problems with the sewage system;
 
b)     $55.00 compensation for the Tenant’s
contribution to the transformer repair
in 2018;
 
c)      $1,053.60 in compensation for increased rent; and




 
d)     $1,000.00 for mental
distress.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
