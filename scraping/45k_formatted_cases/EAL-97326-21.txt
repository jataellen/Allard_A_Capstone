Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97326-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3293 OLD MONTREAL ROAD CUMBERLAND ON K4C1H8


 




Between:


Claire Mcneely


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Andre Montigny


Tenant



 
 
 
Claire Mcneely
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Andre
Montigny (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 10:35 AM. The Landlord and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is based on an N8
notice of termination served on August 23, 2021, with a termination date of
October 31, 2021, alleging that the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
rent.
 
2.    
Rent is due on the
first of each month. The Landlord’s
allegations on the Notice of Termination, which were uncontested by the Tenant,
was that between July 2020 and August 2021, the Tenant paid rent on 10
occasions between two and seven days late. Since the notice was served, the Tenant’s rent has been paid in full, on or before the first of the month.
 
3.    
I find that the Tenant has persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it
was due.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
5.    
The Tenant
indicated the he was under
a misapprehension that rent could
be paid up to
five days late without penalty,
a misapprehension that the Landlord
was unaware of and




File Number: EAL-97326-21
 
did little to
correct. The Tenant’s prompt payment
since the notice of termination was issued, together with his indication that
he could continue to pay rent on time in future, convinces me that an eviction
would be utterly inappropriate, and a conditional order accordingly has been issued requiring that the Tenant pay rent on time for the next year, in default of which the Landlord may
apply to this board for an eviction order without notice.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay in full and on time the monthly rent that
is due from February 1, 2022 up
to an including January 1, 2023
 
2.    
If the Tenant does not
make any of the payments required in paragraph 1 in full and on time the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the
application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 1. This application is made without notice to
the Tenant.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before May 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from June 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
