Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34754-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


906, 21 RICHGROVE DRIVE TORONTO ON M9R2L2


 




Between:


Minto Apartment Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Gianna Tataw


Tenant



 
 
 
Minto Apartment Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Gianna
Tataw (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on January 6, 2022.
 
At 9:53 am Daniela
Atkins (DA), the Landlord, the Landlord’s Representative Faith McGregor (FM)
and Mercy Bessem (MB), the Tenant’s sister attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Landlord’s representative
submitted that MB is not a Tenant, is not listed on the tenancy agreement, and has no standing nor authorization to act on behalf of the Tenant.
MB submitted that she was named Tenant on the Lease Agreement and that
she didn’t have a copy of the agreement accessible. Submitted into evidence
is the Lease Agreement from the Landlord and MB is not a named
Tenant. I told MB that I would
stand the matter
down until 11:15
am in order for her to
produce either her version of the Lease Agreement or authorization to represent
the Tenant. MB later returned with
neither document. I find that MB is not a tenant and did not provide sufficient
authorization to represent the Tenant in this matter. I proceeded as an uncontested matter.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s L2/N8 application is made pursuant
to an N8 notice served
on the Tenant on September 7, 2021 with a termination date of November
30, 2021. The lease was
month-to-month at the time of service and rent was due on the 1st of
every month.




 
2.    
Based on the oral testimony of the Landlord’s Representative and the contents of the N8 notice,
I find that the Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. As at the date of the hearing, the
Tenant has been late in paying rent 15 months in a row that first became due starting October 1, 2020.
 
3.     The pattern of late payments
is unmistakable and persistent.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s Representative indicated
that the late payment has caused financial
strain on the Landlord and obligations to other lenders and providers.
 
5.    
The Landlord is not aware of any circumstances that should result in delaying or denying eviction. The Landlord indicated the late payments
have caused hardship
to the Landlord and obligations to other lenders and providers.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,596.45 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
9.    
The order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated, as of November 30, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$3,099.05 which represents compensation
for the use of the unit from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022, less the
rent deposit, any amount already paid to the Landlord
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $56.59
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from March 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord the application filing
fee in the amount of
$186.00.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
 
 
February 28, 2022
