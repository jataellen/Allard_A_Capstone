Order under Section

Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99083-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


603, 87 COMPTON
STREET KINGSTON ON K7K5Z3


 




Between:


Skyline Living


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin
Lyon-Fougere Kimberley Hearn


Tenants



 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Lyon-
Fougere and Kimberley Hearn (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on November 1, 2021 with respect to
application EAL-87318-19.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $100.00 on or before November 5, 2021. The Tenant did not pay
$100.00 on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $7,140.17 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order
EAL-87318-19. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $7,089.33 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-87318-19 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became
owing.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $977.97 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 12, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-87318-19 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 23, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the
Landlord $6,497.19*. (less any amount paid since the date
the application was filed on December 3, 2021). This amount represents the rent
owing up to January 12, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for
the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $32.15
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 13, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
23, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 24, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 23, 2022, then starting January
24, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 24, 2022.
 
 
January 11, 2022

The tenant has until January 22, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 22, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 24, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
