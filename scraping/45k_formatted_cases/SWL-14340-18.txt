Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-14340-18
 
NAR
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AM and
AVH (row) (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on May
1, 2018.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative, GKL, attended the hearing.  The
Tenant, AVH attended the hearing and declined the opportunity to speak with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.  As of 11:30 a.m., the Tenant, AM was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.             
 
Preliminary Issue;
 
The
Tenant AVH requested to have AM removed as a party.  AVH said that AM move away
over a year ago and is living in another province and has no access to the
rental unit.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative said she was unaware AM had
vacated.  
 
In 1162994
Ontario Inc. v. Bakker et al., [2004] O.J. No. 2565, the Ontario
Court of Appeal held that “possession of a rental unit
refers to some form of control over that unit as demonstrated by factors such
as access to, use of, or occupation of the unit”. The Court noted an earlier
decision in which tenants who had permanently vacated a rental unit when an application
was commenced were not considered “in possession” even though they had not
given notice of their intent to vacate and had kept the keys to the unit. The
Court indicated that the Tribunal (now the Board) will have to decide, based on
the evidence, whether there is a sufficient connection between the rental unit
and the tenant to permit a finding that the tenant was “in possession” of that
rental unit. “  
 
In this case I am satisfied
the Tenant AM is not in possession of the rental unit because he no longer
accesses the rental unit and would not have had knowledge of the hearing.  The
Landlord did not dispute AVH’s evidence.   There was no evidence as to whether
AM gave notice or returned keys.  However, based on AVH’s assertion that AM
does not have care and control of the rental unit it is clear he is no longer
in possession and must be removed as a party to the application. 
            
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent they were required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to May
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective February 26, 2018.
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent is $979.47.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $965.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from December 1, 2017 to February 26,
2018.
6.     
The Tenants paid $1,958.94
after the application was filed.
7.     
The parties agree that the
amount outstanding to May 31,2018, inclusive of rent arrears ($1,469.03), and
costs ($190.00), is $1,659.03.
8.     
The Tenant said that the
Landlord had not yet received the rent for May from Ontario Works, but they
should have it soon.            
9.     
The Landlord was seeking a
standard eleven day voidable order whereby the Tenant would have eleven days
from the date the order is written to void the order.
10.   The Tenant    requested a payment plan whereby
she would pay an additional $50.00 on the 20th of each month until
the arrears are paid.  The Tenant said she is a single parent of a two year old
child and receives Ontario Works and cannot afford to move.  The Tenant said
she ran into difficulty because she stopped having Ontario Works paid the Landlord
directly.  The Tenant said that she has resumed direct payment to the Landlord
from Ontario Works so she should not fall behind again.
11.   In my view, although the payment plan would be
lengthy, it will give the Tenant the opportunity to maintain her living
accommodations with little risk to the Landlord as the Tenant is now having
Ontario Works pay direct.  Should the Tenant fail to make the payments ordered,
then the Landlord can apply for termination under section 74 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006.
12.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1659.03, which represents the
arrears of rent ($1,469.03), and costs ($190.00) outstanding for the period
ending May 31, 2018.
2.      The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
(a)  The
Tenant shall make the following payments to the Landlord in respect of the
monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:

(b)  The
Tenant shall also pay the Landlord the rent for the months of June 2018 to May
2019 in full, and on the fith of each corresponding month.   
 
3.      If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments in accordance with
paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
(a)      The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF
charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must
make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in
paragraph 2 of this order. 
(b)      The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this order shall become
payable on the day following the date of default. The monies owing shall bear
interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
