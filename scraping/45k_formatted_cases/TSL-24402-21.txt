Landlord

Rodney MacDonald


Tenant



 
 
 
4 Hill Heights
Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Rodney Macdonald (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January
12, 2022. Only the Landlord's
Legal Representative, Bryan Rubin
attended the hearing.
As of 3:04 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
October 16, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $921.39.
 
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $700.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2009
to September 18, 2021.




File Number: TSL-24402-21
 
It is ordered that:

The Tenancy is terminated as of October 16, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.   
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $551.99*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 16,
2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.   
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
