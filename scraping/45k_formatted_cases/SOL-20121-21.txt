of:


14, 525 STONECHURCH ROAD E HAMILTON ON
  L8W3B2


 




Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Danielle Atkinson


Tenant



 
 
 
Victoria Park Community Homes
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Danielle Atkinson
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 10,
2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sara Lange, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.        
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 25, 2020.
 
2.        
The monthly rent is $1,112.00. This is market
rent. The Tenant was not eligible for reinstatement of her subsidy.
 
3.        
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $128.38 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
4.        
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to December 25, 2020.
 
5.        
The Tenant paid $484.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.        
The Tenant owes $16,073.00 to the date of hearing
comprised of arrears
($15,887.00) and the application filing fee ($186.00).
 
7.        
The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that the Landlord was originally seeking
a standard 11-day voidable order, but due to the Tenant having an
upcoming operation, was willing to extend the date to February 28, 2022. The
Tenant has made no good faith




File Number: SOL-20121-21
 
effort to bring the arrears down, which are now over 5-times what the original
application amount was.
 
8.        
The Tenant does not dispute the
amount owing. She needs approximately 30 days to move out as she has surgery
later in the afternoon on the day of the hearing plus has another surgery
next week. Her family will be helping
her move after she has recuperated
some.
 
9.        
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 22, 222 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I
accept that the Tenant required some time to vacate due to her hospitalizations
and recovery time, and having to rely on family for the move.
 
10.     
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.        
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 22, 2022.
 
2.        
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,925.90*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
22, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.        
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$20.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.        
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.        
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 22,
2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
March 23, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.        
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 22, 2022, then starting March 23, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.        
Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 23, 2022.
 
8.        
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$14,715.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)             
$15,668.14 if the payment
is made on or before
March 22, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the




File Number: SOL-20121-21
 
appropriate deadline,
then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.        
The Tenant may make a motion to
the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March
23, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
