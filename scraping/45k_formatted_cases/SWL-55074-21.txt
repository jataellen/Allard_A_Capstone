Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher Burns


Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Christopher Burns (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent.
 
This
application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s legal agent, D. Curran, and legal representative, M. Roy, attended
the hearing. As of 12:37 p.m., the Tenant was
not present or represented although
properly served with notice of this
hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
N5 Notice
of Termination
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord served
the Tenant with an N5 Notice
of Termination on the Tenant on August 17, 2021.
 
2.     The N5 Notice
alleges that on August 12, 2021, the Tenant ran an extension
cord to another unit. On August 13, 2021, it was discovered that the Tenant
did not have hydro in their unit.
D. Curran, the
Landlord’s district manager, testified that the extension cord is a safety
hazard as the cord runs through the grass. This poses a tripping hazard and an
electrical safety issue for the maintenance people cutting the grass. Further,
as per the lease agreement the Tenant entered into with the Landlord, the
Tenant is responsible for hydro in their unit. The Tenant not having hydro in
the unit poses health and safety concerns as the pipes could freeze
in the wintertime and because
the smoke detectors
are electric, the absence of hydro means they are
inoperable. Submitted into evidence was a video from




 
August 17,
2021 showing the extension cord running from the back door of the Tenant’s unit and through the grass. D. Curran testified
that the Tenant’s
unit did not have hydro as
of August 24, 2021.
 
3.    
Subsection 64 (1) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice
of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is
such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes
by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes
with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another
tenant. 2006, c. 17, s. 64 (1).
 
4.    
Subsection 64(3) states that the
notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within
seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct
or activity or corrects
the omission.
 
5.     I am satisfied
that the Tenant
running the electrical cord and not having hydro
substantially interfered with the landlord and other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment based on D. Curran’s
testimony and the video of the extension cord. I am also satisfied that the
Tenant did not void the Notice
as there was still no hydro in the unit within seven days after the notice
was served.
 
N8 Notice
of Termination
 
6.     The Landlord also applied because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord served the Tenant
with an N8 Notice of Termination on September 13, 2021.
 
7.    
Rent is due on the first of each month.
 
8.     As per the N8 Notice, the Tenant had not paid rent in
full by the first of the month eight times.
 
9.    
The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
SECTION 83 CONSIDERATIONS
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1).
 
11.  The Landlord disclosed that the Landlord
had to remove the extension cord four times and
the Tenant tampered with the hydro meter. Further, the Tenant was late an additional
four times after the notice was served. These are not positive
considerations. The Tenant was




 
not present to disclose
any circumstances for me to consider delaying
or denying eviction. As such, relief will not be
granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 14, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 14, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$415.71, which represents compensation for the use
of the unit from September 8, 2021 to February 3, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $2.79 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February
4, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 14, 2022, then starting February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
February 15, 2022.
