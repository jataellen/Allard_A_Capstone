Order under Section 135
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: CET-94986-20
 



In the matter
of:


3278 WAXWING DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L5N5X9


 




Between:


Shawn Clancy


Tenant




 


and


 




 


Yasir Ali


Landlord



 
Shawn Clancy (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Yasir Ali (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 21, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Tenant's
Representative (Diane Irwin sister of the Tenant)
and the Landlord's Legal Representative Lisa Barder attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant asserts the Landlord collected rent in
excess of the amount allowed by the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') and that the rent charged by the Landlord is illegal as they did not
receive a proper notice of rent increase and the rate of increase charged
exceeds the guideline amount.
 
2.     The Rent Increase Guideline (‘guideline’) is set on an
annual basis by the Provincial government establishing the maximum amount that
a landlord can increase a tenant’s rent without the approval of the Board.
Landlords may only increase a sitting tenant’s
rent once every 12 months by the guideline amount.
 
3.     A fundamental objective
of the Act is to clearly
define the amount
and the circumstances in which rents may be
increased by a Landlord. Consistent with this objective, the legislation provides
that a tenant shall be given at least 90 days notice, in the prescribed form, of a Landlord’s intention to increase the rent. Ultimately, the purpose of the 90-day period is to allow a Tenant sufficient time to accept
the increase, or to serve
the required 60-day notice to
terminate the tenancy.
 
4.     The tenancy between
the Tenant and the Landlord
commenced November 1, 2018 and the lawful rent then was $950.00. On
June 1, 2019 the Landlord increased the monthly rent to $1,200.00 without
giving the Tenant a proper notice of rent increase pursuant to the
provincial guidelines.
 
5.    
At issue is the rent increase
in excess of the amount permitted under the Act, which had been paid by the Tenant.




 
 
 
 
6.     The relevant provisions of the Act are:
Notice of rent increase required
116 (1) A landlord
shall not increase
the rent charged
to a tenant for a rental unit without first giving the tenant at least 90 days written (N1) notice of
the landlord’s intention to do so.
Increase void without
notice
116
(4) An increase in rent is void if the landlord has not given the notice required by this section, and the landlord must give a new
notice before the landlord can take the increase.
 
Money collected illegally
135 
(1) A tenant or former tenant of a rental unit may apply to the
Board for an order that the landlord or agent of
the landlord pay to the tenant any money the person collected
or retained in contravention of this Act.
 
Rent increase deemed
not void
135.1 
(1) An increase in rent that would otherwise be void under
subsection 116 (4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant
has paid the increased rent in
respect of each rental period
for at least 12 consecutive months.
 
Time limitation
135 (4) No order shall be made under this section
with respect to an application filed more than one
year after the person collected
or retained money in contravention of this Act or the Tenant
Protection Act, 1997.
 
Rent deemed lawful
136 (1) Rent charged one or more
years earlier shall be deemed to be lawful rent unless an application has been made within one year after
the date that amount was first charged and the
lawfulness of the rent charged is in issue in the application
 
Increase deemed lawful
136 (2) An increase
in rent shall be deemed to be lawful unless
an application has been made within one year after the date the
increase was first charged and the lawfulness of the rent increase is in issue
in the application.
 
7.    
It was undisputed that the Landlord did not serve the Tenant
with a recent notice of rent
increase pursuant to the Act, and that the rent increase charged by the
Landlord commencing June 1, 2019 was in excess of the guideline amount.
 
8    Effective July 21, 2020, as a result of the Protecting Tenants
and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020, there was a new section
135.1 added to the Act. It states the following:




 
135.1
(1)  An increase in rent that
would otherwise be void under subsection 116 (4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant
has paid the increased rent in respect
of each rental period for at
least 12 consecutive months.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply with respect to an increase
in rent if the tenant has, within one year after the date
the increase was first charged, made an application in which the validity of
the rent increase is in issue.
(3)  For greater certainty, if subsection (1) applies with respect to an increase
in rent, section 116 is deemed to have been complied with.
(4)  For greater certainty, nothing
in this section limits the application of section
136.
(5)  This section applies with
respect to an increase in rent even if it was first charged before the day the
Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020 receives
Royal Assent, provided
the validity of the rent increase
was not finally determined by the Board before that day.
 
8.     As a result of the new section 135.1, even if a
landlord increased the rent without serving a
tenant with any notice of rent increase, the otherwise unlawful
rent increased is deemed
to be valid if the tenant
pays the increased rent for a year without
filing an application with the Board challenging the lawfulness of the increase.
 
9.     Clearly under subsection 136(1) of the Act, if a tenant
acquiesces to the payment of an
otherwise unlawful rent for more than twelve months, the unlawful amount is
deemed lawful, and the intent of section 136 is to prevent those who knowingly
pay more than their lawful rent for longer than twelve months from commencing
proceedings on that account.
 
10.  The twelve-month rule under section 136 does not limit
the Tenants’ claim to the preceding twelve months
during which the unlawful amount
was paid. In this instance,
the twelve-month deeming rule under section 136 did not start running
against the Tenant until June 2, 2020 the date of the application was filed
with the Board. The claim goes back to the date June 1, 2019, when the
purported unlawful rent was first charged.
 
11.  Consequently, because the unlawful rent was first
charged back June 1, 2019, more than
one year before the Tenant late filed this application, and the fact the tenant
acquiesced to the payment of an otherwise unlawful rent for more than twelve
months, the unlawful amount is deemed lawful pursuant to 136 (2) of the Act.
 
12.  Therefore, the lawful
rent is deemed
$1,200.00 and the Landlord has not collected money in excess of the amount allowed by the Act.
 
13.  
This order contains
all of the reasons
for my decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
