Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dale Mclean


Tenant



 
 
Anisur Sikder (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dale Mclean
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex that has
three or fewer residential units; and because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
974 4825 8231#
on February 1, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s Representative, Christina Nastas
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Tenant lives in the basement of
the residential complex and the unit was not identified on the N7 Notice which
renders it an invalid notice of termination.
The N7 Notice doesn’t comply
with section 43 (1) (a) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
which required the Landlord to identify the unit for which the notice is given.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
