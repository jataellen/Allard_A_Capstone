Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24615-21



In the matter
of:


A, 9 WENTWORTH STREET NORTH
  HAMILTON ON L8L5T8


 




Between:


Renniel Francis Ganitano Kartheek Gajjala


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


 
William
  Thompson


 
Tenant



 
 
Renniel Francis Ganitano and Kartheek Gajjala (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William Thompson (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by video conference on December
14, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords’ Legal Representative, Peter Guzina, attended the
hearing. As of 10:59 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 30,
2021 to December 29, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective September
8, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $975.00.
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
6.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would
be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated. The Tenant must move out
of the rental unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlords $7,634.50*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$32.05 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January 17, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after
January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,561.00** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or
after January 17, 2022 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.

6th Floor Hamilton ON L8P4Y7
