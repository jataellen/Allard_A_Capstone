Jacob Haugh


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
 
Vladimir Ladygin (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jacob Haugh (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused undue
damage to the premises and used the rental unit or the residential complex
in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has caused
or can be expected to cause significant damage; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was resolved
by order TEL-18074-21 issued on November
17, 2021.
 
On December 3, 2021, the Tenant requested
a review of the order and
that the order be stayed until the request to review the
order is resolved.
 
On December 3, 2021 interim order TEL-18074-21-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on November 17, 2021.
 
The request was heard by videoconference on February 9, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s legal representative C. Do Couto attended the hearing.
 
Procedural:
 
1.     In the application the Landlord is stated to be TVM 43
James (Amit Sofer). The building was sold to Vladimir Ladygin
after the application was filed and before the review hearing.
 
2.     The application and the style of cause are amended
accordingly: Vladimir Ladygin
is added as Landlord and TVM 43 James (Amit Sofer) is removed.

Determinations:
 
1.    
Since the Tenant did not appear
at the hearing to support
the review request, I find that this review request has been
abandoned.
 
2.    
The Tenant’s
review request states that the Tenant lives with multiple disabilities. The
subject of the application is damage caused by the Tenant, which is largely
repaired. The Landlord testified that there have been other problems at the unit since the last order was
issued but these problems are not so serious that they warrant an immediate lifting of the stay in these circumstances. The
lifting of the stay will therefore be delayed to February 28, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order TEL-18074-21 issued on
November 17, 2021 is denied.
The order is confirmed and remains unchanged.
 
2.     The interim order issued on December 3, 2021 is
cancelled. The stay of order TEL- 18074-21 is lifted
on February 28, 2022. The
eviction shall not be enforced
prior to February 28, 2022.
