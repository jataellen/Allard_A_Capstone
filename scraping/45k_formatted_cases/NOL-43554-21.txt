Between:


Chris Caccamo Adam

Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Rachel Hamlin
  Terry Hamlin


Tenants



 
 
 
Chris Caccamo
and Adam Caccamo (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Rachel Hamlin and Terry Hamlin (the 'Tenants') because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlords for the damage.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 22, 2021.
 
Only the Landlords’ Representative Mathew Smiley and the Landlord
Adam Caccamo attended the
hearing. The Tenants did not attend the hearing, although properly served with
notice of hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlords brought this application, on the basis the
Tenants have wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit or residential complex.
 
2.   
The Tenants are still in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    The Landlords’ Form N5 alleges, among other things,
that the Tenants damaged the front/screen doors, window screens, interior
doors, drywall, basement flooring and countertops; and, that the Tenants
removed kitchen cabinets and flooring in the upper level of the home
 
4.    In addition to seeking the Tenants’ eviction, the
Landlords also seek $30,000.00 in damages from the Tenants.




 
5.    Section 89 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) allows a landlord to apply
to the Board for an order requiring
a tenant to pay reasonable costs that
the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of, or where repairing
is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential
complex wilfully or negligently causes undue
damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is
in possession of the rental unit.
 
6.   
At the hearing, the Landlord
tendered as evidence pictures of the residence in its current state. The pictures showed the rental unit in a
complete state of disrepair: The interior floors contained heavy dark staining with numerous tiles removed, the
entire carpet area contained heavy dark staining; the baseboards and various
interior doors were removed; the kitchen countertops and cabinets contained
black staining and some cupboards were removed entirelt; the screen door
leading to the back patio area was completely destroyed thereby exposing the
interior home to the outside elements; and the exterior door to the rental unit
contained large markings. In
addition, the pictures also showed markings on
the walls and a large accumulation of garbage throughout the interior
and exterior of the rental unit.
 
7.    The damage caused was clearly extensive, and beyond
wear and tear. The Landlord tendered
pictures of the interior and exterior of the rental unit from June 1,2017,
prior to the Tenants moving into the
rental unit (the “2017 Pictures”). The
2017 Pictures showed the property in a clean state and ready for occupancy. The carpets and flooring contained no
staining and the kitchen area, including cabinets/cupboards were in a good
state of repair
 
8.    This damage is all contained within the Tenants’ unit.
In the absence of an alternative explanation, I am prepared to draw the inference
that the Tenants or someone they permitted in the unit caused this damage.
Moreover, by its very nature, I find that the damage was clearly done wilfully,
and due to its extensive nature I find that it is undue.
 
9.    The rental property will require substantial repairs.
The Landlord produced a renovation quote dated August 1, 2021 from a local
contractor for labour and materials, in the amount of $27,000.00. The quote is broken
down to $15,500.00 for the kitchen area work and
$11,500.00 for the flooring
and interior/exterior doors.
 
10. Given the extensive nature of the damages and that
nearly the entire interior of the rental unit will have to be repaired to bring
the unit to a liveable state, I find $11,500.00 for the flooring and
interior/exterior doors to be reasonable. As
the kitchen was not new at the time the Tenants moved into the property, I find
that 75% of the quoted $15,500.00 for kitchen work to be reasonable, for a
total cost of $11,625.00.
 
11. Section 83  requires
that  I  consider all the circumstances, including the Tenants’
and the Landlords’ situations to determine if it would be appropriate to grant section 83 relief from eviction. The Landlord
advised that the Tenants have not been welcoming to the Landlord conducting the
needed repairs and that the Tenants have stopped paying rent. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection




 
83(2) of the
Act and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants did not attend the hearing, and thus
did not provide any evidence that may be relevant to my determination under s.
83.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
February 21, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $23,125.00, which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage and/or replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing on or before February 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 22, 2022.
