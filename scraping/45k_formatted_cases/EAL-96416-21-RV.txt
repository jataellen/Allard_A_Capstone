Tenants



 
 
Review Order
 
 
John Rezk (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sophie
Muluka and Edwin Afande (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered
into an agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.
 
This application was resolved by order EAL-96416-21 issued on September
21, 2021. On October 13,
2021, the Landlord requested a review of the order.
On October 26, 2021 interim order EAL-96416-21-RV-IN was
issued.
 
The Landlord alleged that there was a serious
error in the order in relation to the application having been dismissed because
of the N12 Notice of Termination was invalid.
 
The request was heard via videoconference on December 20, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative David Danielson, the Landlord and the Tenant
Edwin Afande attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
At the outset of the hearing
the parties consented
to the request for a review and the
application was heard de novo.
 
2.     It was uncontested that the Tenants
had vacated the rental unit on November
7, 2021.

3.     As a result, a hearing on the merits
was no longer required.
 
4.     The Landlord requested
that the application fee be ordered
paid by the Tenants.
 
5.    
The Board’s Guideline 3, Costs sets out that the application fee is not normally ordered
in applications to evict tenants based on a no-fault ground, such as the
case in this application based on the N12 notice of termination.
 
6.    
There were no unusual
circumstances in this application that warrant ordering
the application fee be paid, therefore, I decline to make such an order.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review order EAL-96416-21 issued on September
21, 2021 is granted.
The order is cancelled and replaced with the following.
 
2.     The Landlord application is dismissed.
