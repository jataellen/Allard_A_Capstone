In the matter
of:


B, 1734
SECOND STREET WEST CORNWALL ON K6J5E3


 




Between:


Deborah Killoran
J


Landlord

Peter Kossen


Tenant



 
Deborah Killoran (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter Kossen (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The Landlord also applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on September 1, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative, James Moak, the Landlord, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
December 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1)
of the Act. The Tenant submitted that the last month he paid in full
dates to December 2020. The Tenant does not deny the allegations made by the
Landlord. The Tenant submitted that he is experiencing financial difficulties
and that his landscaping business has suffered. The Tenant submitted that he
was dealing with depression, however
he had no medical evidence
to support this claim. I acknowledge that the Tenant experienced
some financial difficulty, however I do not find that this tenancy is
maintainable. The Tenant has been struggling to make rent payments for an
extended period and prolonging this tenancy will unjustly prejudiced the
Landlord.

2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before

and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:

$9,401.00 if the payment

that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
