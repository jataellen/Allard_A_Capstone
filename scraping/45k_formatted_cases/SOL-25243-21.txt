Brick Properties
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Katherine Scott (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 18, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Judith Callender, attended the hearing. As of 1:55 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to
January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 14, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,350.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 29, 2021 to September 27, 2021.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of October
14, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: SOL-25243-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $602.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October
14, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
