Landlord



 
 
 
Natalia Francis
(the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Subreet Dhingra
(the 'Landlord'), gave a notice of termination in bad faith.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 28, 2021.
The Tenant and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant brought a T5
Application claiming the Landlord gave her a N12 notice of termination in bad
faith. She seeks the difference in
rent between her rent at the rental unit and the rent she paid at the new
rental unit for a period of one year, in the amount of
$9,600.00.
 
2.    
Pursuant to section
57(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, the Board may make an order against a landlord if, on
application by a former tenant of a rental unit, the Board determines that the
landlord gave a notice of termination under section 48 in bad faith, the former tenant vacated the rental unit
as a result of the notice, and no
person referred to in clause 48 occupied the rental unit within a reasonable
time after the former tenant vacated the rental unit.
 
3.    
To be successful in her
T5 application, the Tenant must establish all three of the requirements of
subsection 57(1)(a) on a balance of probabilities:
 
First, that the Landlord
gave a notice of termination under section 48 of the Act (the N12 notice) in bad faith;
 
Second, that the Tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of the N12 notice or Board order based on the N12 notice;




 
Third, that the person
named in the N12 notice
did not move into the rental unit within a reasonable time after the
Tenant vacated.
 
4.    
For the reasons
outlined below, I do not find on a balance of probabilities that the notice of
termination was given in bad faith.
 
5.     The Landlord’s Form N12 was served on the
Tenant on March 12, 2019, with a termination
date of June 13, 2019. Following
receipt of the Form
N12, the Tenant served the
Landlord with a Form N9, indicating she would be moving out on April 13, 2019
 
6.    
The Form N12 stated that the Landlord and his spouse were going to move into the
rental unit. The Tenant’s evidence is
that she vacated the rental unit in April 2019 and that she returned to the
rental unit on Halloween night 2019 with her children and that there was an
unknown “male” at the door.  Understandably,
the Tenant became suspicious. She ultimately brought this Application on the
basis there was someone else living at the rental
unit and thus, she submits the Landlord served the Form N12 in bad faith.
 
7.    
While the initial
burden falls on the Tenant to establish that the notice of termination was
served in bad faith, it is presumed, unless the contrary is proven on a
balance of probabilities, that a landlord gave a notice of termination
under s. 48 in bad faith if, within one year
after the former tenant vacates the rental unit, the
landlord enters into a tenancy agreement in respect of
the rental unit with someone other than the former tenant.
 
8.    
While I can certainly
appreciate the Tenant’s suspicions at discovering a stranger living at the rental unit in October
2019, the Landlord did provide an adequate explanation. The Landlord testified he moved into the master bedroom of the
house in June 2019 and asked his two adult male cousins to come live with him
to help share the cost, each paying $500/month. The Landlord indicated his spouse was living and studying in New
York at the time and would visit on a part-time basis, until health issues
prevented her from travelling as often. The
Landlord appeared to be sincere in his testimony. His explanation rebutted the presumption of bad faith and
provided an adequate explanation as to why the Tenant encountered an unknown
individual at the residence in October 2019.
 
9.     In the alternative, I do not find on a
balance of probabilities that the Tenant vacated the rental unit as a result of
the Form N12. The Tenant admittedly
signed a new lease on March 17, 2019, which was 5 days after the Form N12
served. The Tenant had engaged a
real estate agent to assist in her search and indicated that she searched “for
a couple of weeks” before securing
new rental accommodations. I find
that at the time the Form N12 was served, the Tenant had made up her mind to
find other accommodations and thus the second requirement under subsection
57(1)(a) was not met.
 
It is ordered that
 
1.    The Tenant’s
application is dismissed.
