Order under Section
78(11) and 204
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93456-18-SA
 
 
 
Q.R.S.L
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.O (the 'Tenant') because he
failed to meet a condition specified in order TSL-84061-17-SA issued on June
20, 2017.
 
The
Landlord's application was resolved by order TSL-93456-18, issued on March 12,
2018. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order TSL-93456-18.
 
This
motion was heard in Toronto on April 13, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by M.Z, Barrister and Solicitor. The Tenant did not
attend the hearing. The Tenant’s wife, who also resides of the unit, J. B
(“JB”) attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenant. The Tenant was represented
by M. S.M, a law student with Parkdale Community Legal Services.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant remains in possession of the unit.
The monthly rent is $1,317.41. 
2.     
Order TSL-84061-17-SA required, in pertinent
part, the Tenant to pay the monthly rent no later than the first business day
of the month from July, 2017 to May, 2018, inclusive.
3.     
In the affidavit in support of the L4
application the Landlord claims the Tenant failed to pay the rent for March,
2018 before the first business day of the month.
4.     
It was not disputed the Tenant failed to pay the
rent for March, 2018 as ordered. It was further not disputed the Tenant paid
$900.00 to the Landlord on or about March 12, 2018 and $1,294.12 on March 30,
2018.
5.     
The parties agreed, as at the date of the
hearing, the total arrears of rent to April 30, 2018, amounts to $2,393.89. The
substantial payments made by the Tenant, as outlined in the preceding
paragraph, did not come close to bringing the Tenant’s arrears balance to zero
because the Tenant did not make any rent payments for January and February,
2018. The Landlord’s ledger also reflects the Tenant had a credit balance going
into January, 2018 as the Tenant made two payments, each in the sum of $900.00,
to the Landlord in December, 2017.
6.     
As there is no dispute the Tenant breached the
June 20th consent order, this means that the only real issue on the
set aside motion is whether or not it would be unfair in all of the
circumstances to set aside the eviction order. 
Discretionary Relief Under Subsection
78(11)(b)   
7.     
Pursuant to subsection 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”),
the Board may make an order setting aside the ex parte order issued if
the Board is satisfied, having regard to “all the circumstances”, that it would
not be unfair to set aside the order.
8.     
As such, I have the discretion to grant relief to the Tenant by
setting aside order TSL-93456-18 notwithstanding the
fact that the Tenant has failed to meet a condition specified
in consent order TSL-84061-17-SA issued on June 20, 2017. 
9.     
The Board’s Interpretation Guideline 7, which is not binding on
me but I chose to follow in this case, states that in considering subsection
78(11)(b) of the Act I should take into account:
“Circumstances that occurred after the date
of the mediated 
agreement or conditional order that caused the party to be
unable to 
meet the terms of the agreement or order. (Circumstances that

occurred prior to the issuance of the conditional
order or the signing 
of the mediated agreement should have been considered
at the time 
the conditional order was made or the mediated agreement
was 
signed, with respect to the previous
application.)
The
circumstances 
of both the landlord and tenant and the
impact on other occupants in 
the residential complex in delaying or
denying eviction.” 
10.  
I am of the opinion that subsection 78(11)(b) of
the Act requires a broad interpretation of “all the circumstances”. In Chieu
v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 3 (CanLII),
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, a case concerning the exercise of discretion not to remove
a permanent resident from Canada, the Supreme Court considered the ordinary and
grammatical meaning of “all the circumstances of the case” and noted at
paragraphs 29 and 30:
“An
ordinary reading of “all the circumstances of the case” leads to a broad
interpretation of s.70(1)(b). The first consideration is that these words
appear in a provision establishing a discretionary or equitable jurisdiction. 
The words do not provide detailed guidelines as to how this discretionary
jurisdiction is to be exercised, but instead leave the scope of the discretion
open-ended. 
The second
factor favouring a broad reading of s. 70(1)(b) is the grammatical sense of the
phrase “all the circumstances of the case”.  The word “all” is defined by the
Concise Oxford Dictionary (8th ed. 1990), at p. 29, as “entire number of” or
“greatest possible”.  In this context, it would therefore mean considering the
greatest possible number of factors relevant to the removal of a permanent
resident from Canada.  It is evident that one such factor is the conditions an
individual would face upon removal.”
11.  
Moreover, I am directed by Matthews v. Algoma
Timberlakes Corp., 2010 ONCA 468 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2710 (C.A.) to interpret the Act, which
is a remedial statute, in a broad and purposive fashion.
12.  
Landlord’s counsel submitted, given all the
circumstances, it would be unfair to set aside the March 12th order
because the Tenant was represented by a legal representative when he agreed to
the terms of the June 20th order and, further, it is the “general
policy” of the Board to uphold consent orders, unless there is good reason not
to do so. I am unaware of a Board “policy” on upholding consent orders. Indeed,
if such a policy existed it would only serve to fetter a Member’s discretion as
a determination of whether a consent order is upheld can only be made after a
hearing involving issues of mixed fact and law. 
13.  
In any event, the Tenant here is not alleging he
agreed to the terms of the June 20th consent order in the absence of
informed consent. The Tenant’s position is, for a variety of reasons, and
notwithstanding the admitted breach, I should set aside the March 12th
ex parte order—and this is a procedural step accorded to tenants by the
legislation.
14.  
Landlord’s counsel further submitted that, at
the conclusion of the hearing, I only had “part of the evidence” because the
Tenant failed to provide adequate evidence going to i) why the Tenant and JB
have a second bank account, ii) why the Tenant paid the family’s legal fees
instead of the rent, iii) why no corroborating evidence was provided for the
purported legal fees paid by the Tenants, iv) the discrepancies regarding the
utility payments made by the Tenant during the material time and, v) why the
Tenant did not pay $1,976.48 to the Landlord prior to the hearing as JB was in
possession of a cheque from Ontario Works (“OW”), in the said amount, at the
hearing.
15.  
 I agree with Landlord’s counsel the Tenant’s
evidence going to the payment of utility costs in March, 2018 left much to be
desired—both in terms of the documentary evidence presented and JB’s testimony.
I cannot say this issue was adequately presented and, as at the end of the
hearing, it was unclear when in March the Tenant made the utility payment(s)
and the quantum of the payment(s). However, overall, the monetary amount
involved in this regard is minor and the evidence presented shows the Tenant
paid in excess of $300.00 to Enercare on or about March 20, 2018.
16.  
With respect to the other inadequacies in the
Tenant’s evidence as outlined in paragraph 14, above, such as that related to
the payment of legal fees, Landlord’s counsel was given an unimpeded opportunity
to cross-examine JB in this connection. It was open, on cross-examination, for
Landlord’s counsel to put any questions to JB in relation to all issues as all
issues, perhaps with the exception of the OW cheque in JB’s possession, came
out on direct examination. In the end, I am essentially left with JB’s affirmed
and uncontradicted testimony going to the points raised by Landlord’s counsel.
17.  
Although not raised as an issue by the Landlord,
it appears the consent order issued on June 20, 2017 arose out of a set aside
motion brought by the Tenant. The Tenant, from my reading of order
TSL-84061-17-SA, issued on June 20th, breached a previous
conditional consent order, TSL-79882-16-RV, issued by the Board on February 23,
2017. So, the Tenant has been extended relief, in the past, and during this
tenancy, by the Board and, laudably, the Landlord on at least two prior
occasions. This is certainly a factor, which militates against granting further
relief to the Tenant pursuant to subsection 78(11)(b) of the Act. However, based
on the totality of the evidence presented, order TSL-93456-18, issued on March
12, 2018, must be set aside for the following reasons.
18.  
While the Tenant has been extended relief by the Board
and the Landlord in the past by way of at least two consent orders, the past
consent orders issued do not reflect that any circumstances, particular
to this family and which occurred prior to the issuance of the conditional
order, were considered at the time the conditional orders were made. I say this
especially with respect to the Tenant’s and JB’s two minor children who live in
the unit and attend school in the area. 
19.  
The two minor children will likely be adversely
affected, through no fault of her own, by the termination of this tenancy. The
family has lived in the unit for three years and the children, in addition to
attending a nearby school, likely have friends in the neighbourhood and in the
residential complex. Equally important, a housing disruption towards the end of
the school year will, in all likelihood, have an adverse effect on the children’s
schooling. As an adjudicator, I am required by Baker v. MCI 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817,
to consider the best interests of
children who are directly affected by a subsection 78(11)(b) analysis. Given all the facts presented, am of the opinion that it is in the
best interests of the children to remain in the unit. However, there are
additional reasons to grant the Tenant’s motion pursuant to subsection 78(11)(b). 
20.  
The Tenant’s uncontradicted evidence is, while
OW stopped paying the monthly rent directly to the Landlord in October, 2017,
the Tenant took steps in April, 2018, to ensure the monthly rent is paid directly
to the Landlord in the future. 
21.  
At the hearing, the Tenant’s legal
representative stated the Tenant is in a position to pay all outstanding
arrears, in the sum of $2,393.89, to the Landlord on April 20, 2018. Towards
this end, at the hearing JB, the Tenant’s wife, was in possession of a cheque
issued by OW, in the sum of $1,976.48, and which monies JB stated would be put
towards the April 20th payment to the Landlord.
22.  
Equally important, it was not disputed the
Tenant complied with the terms of order TSL-84061-17-SA, issued on June 20,
2017, by paying the monthly rent as ordered until November, 2017. Such
compliance for an extended period of time certainly indicates the Tenant is
serious about preserving the tenancy as are the substantial, albeit
insufficient, payments made after November, 2017—especially during March, 2018.

23.  
If the monthly rent is paid directly to the
Landlord in the future as JB promised during the hearing, the monthly rent
going forward will be paid in full and on time and the Landlord will not be
prejudiced. On the other hand, the Tenant’s failure to do so would authorize
the Landlord to seek to have the tenancy terminated and the Tenant evicted,
without further notice to the Tenant.
24.  
For the foregoing reasons, and having considered
all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
25.  
The Tenant should note, in making this order, I
am aware that my exercise of discretion is centrally based upon the continuing
presence of minor children in the unit and the impact on them if the eviction
order is not set aside. However, and given the relief extended to the Tenant in
the past, this exercise of discretion should not be misunderstood as ongoing
protection for the Tenant from the consequences of any future breaches.  It is
simply a recognition that, at present, the combination of the factors noted
above, in my view, warrant granting a further opportunity to the Tenant to
continue the tenancy by abiding by the terms of my order, below.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.     
The motion to set aside order TSL-93456-18,
issued on June 20, 2017, is granted.
2.     
The order is cancelled and replaced with this
order.
3.     
On or before April 27, 2018, the Tenant shall
pay $2,393.89 to the Landlord, representing arrears of rent to April 30, 2018.
4.     
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing as stated in the preceding paragraph by April 27, 2018, the Tenant
will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from April 28, 2018
at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
5.     
Commencing May, 2018 and each and every month
thereafter to October, 2018, inclusive, the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent
to the Landlord no later than the first business day of the month.
6.      If the
Tenant fails to comply with the provisions of paragraphs 3 or 5 of this order,
the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant. 
7.      The
Landlord must make an application under s.78 of the Act within 30 days of a
breach of the condition set out in paragraphs 3 or 5 of this order.
