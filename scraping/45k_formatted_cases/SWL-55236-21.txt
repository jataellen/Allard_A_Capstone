UNIVERSITY AVENUE E WINDSOR ON N9A2Z2


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kaitlyn Girard


Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex
Community Housing Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Kaitlyn Girard (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 17, 2022. Only the Landlord’s agent,
T. Mokhtari
(TM), and legal representative, C. Parrott, attended the hearing. As of 1:12
p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented although
properly served with Notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
seriously impaired the safety of any
person. The Landlord served the
Tenant with an N7 Notice of Termination on September 24, 2021.
 
2.    
The N7 Notice alleges
that on September 8, 2021, the Tenant had disconnected his smoke
detector. TM testified to this event and submitted into evidence was a photograph showing the smoke detector missing.
 
3.    
Pursuant to section 66 of the Act, a landlord may give a tenant a notice of termination if an
act or omission of the tenant seriously impairs the safety of another person, provided that the act or omission
complained of occurs in the residential complex.
 
4.     In order to
be successful on this ground, the Landlord must establish that the effect of
the Tenant’s actions threatens the wellbeing or physical integrity of another
person to such a degree that termination of the tenancy
is reasonable in order to ensure the safety of others.




 
5.    
In my view, the Tenant having
removed the fire alarm poses a serious risk to the health and safety
of others in the residential complex. TM testified that removal of the smoke
alarm poses a safety
hazard as there are over one hundred
residents in the residential complex. In having the smoke alarmed
removed, other tenants would not be expediently alerted to a fire.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
7.     TM testified that after the Notice was served, the Tenant removed
the smoke detector
again on December 9, 2021, and during an inspection, it was found that
there was significant damage to the rental unit. The Tenant also sweeps
garbage into the hallway and stairwells,
obstructs walkways with a shopping cart and allows trespassed people and
animals into the residential complex. Further, a person claimed they were held
captive in the Tenant’s unit and had to scale the building to escape. These are
not positive considerations. The Tenant did not attend the hearing to testify to his circumstances for me to consider refusing or delaying eviction. As such,
relief will not be granted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
14, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before February 14, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February
14, 2022, then starting February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after February 15, 2022. The Sheriff is requested to expedite
the enforcement of this order.
