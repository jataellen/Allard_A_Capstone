Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44700-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


401, 277 NORTHERN AVENUE E SAULT STE
  MARIE ON P6B6E1


 




Between:


Marshall Hope
The Columbus Club
Housing Corporation


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Danielle Boudreau


Tenant



 
 
 
Marshall Hope and The Columbus
Club Housing Corporation (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Danielle Boudreau (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 19, 2021 with
respect to application NOL-42958-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful
monthly rent in full, on or before
January 1, 2022. Only a partial payment of $208.00
was received on January 3, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 18, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 18, 2022, then starting
February 19, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 19, 2022.
