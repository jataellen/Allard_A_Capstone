John Pietruszko


Tenant



 
 
 
Metcap Living Management Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Pietruszko (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also
claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration charges.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 18, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Sara Mathew, attended
the hearing. As of 1:52 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 26, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on December
31, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     As of November
1, 2021, the monthly rent for the unit is $1,400.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord incurred charges
of $21.00 for cheques tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which were returned NSF and $60.00 for related administration charges.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 21, 2021 to
November 26, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant paid $1,400.00 after the application was filed.




File Number: SOL-25142-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of December 31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,838.06*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December 31,
2021 and the total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant,
less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 4, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 5, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
