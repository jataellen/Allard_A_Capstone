  ON L4E2V4


 




Between:


Hongying Zhang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Erdi Lako


Tenant



 
 
 
Hongying Zhang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Erdi Lako
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or
negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also
applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the
damage; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 19, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 10:41 the Tenant was not present or represented
at the hearing, although properly notified of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
filed this application on February 22, 2021 for N5 and N7 notices
of termination. The Landlord
also claimed damages.
 
2.    
The 1st N5 was served on the Tenant on 26 January 26, 2021 alleging the Tenant
substantially interfered with another tenant and for damages. The voiding period was
January 26 to February 3, 2021. The
Termination date was February 18, 2021.
 
3.    
The 2nd N5 was served
on the Tenant on February
3, 2021.
4.    
Sections 68 (1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006,
(the ‘Act’) states:




 
 
Section 68 (1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if,
(a)          
a notice
of termination was given to the tenant
under section 62, 64 or 67;
and
(b)          
more than seven
days but less than six months after the notice
mentioned in clause (a) was given to the tenant, an activity takes place,
conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes grounds
for a notice of termination under section 60, 61, 62, 64 or 67, other than an
activity, conduct or a situation that is described in subsection 61 (1) and
that involves an illegal act, trade, business or occupation described in clause
61 (2) (a).
(bold emphasis
added)
 
5.    
In this case the was served
during the voiding
period of the 1st N5 and is therefore defective.
 
6.    
The application could therefore proceed
on the basis of the 1st N5.
 
7.    
The 1st N5 alleged:
 
a.   
The Tenant consumed marijuana
in the rental unit.
b.   
The Tenant installed a portable washer without notice to the Landlord.
c.   
Over a period of time, the Tenant shouted,
screamed and was violent inside
his unit.
d.   
Over a period of time the Tenant shouted
and screamed at other Tenants
and otherwise disturbed their reasonable enjoyment of their rental
units.
e.   
The Tenant caused damage to his unit, when the portable
washer flooded, and caused damage to the residential
complex by installing exterior antenna.
 
8.    
The N5 was vague as to
the damages and how the $5,000.00 claimed had been calculated. The Landlord also claimed this on the application, however
he testified that the repairs had not been carried
out, these were just his own estimates. Section
43 of the Act sets out that the notices of termination must be clear as to the
allegations, particularly so that the Tenant could choose to void them. In this instance given how vague the
allegations of damages were, the claim for damages in the N5 and the
application is dismissed.
 
9.    
The Landlord
testified that he does not reside in the rental
unit, and that there were no
witnesses to speak to the allegations in the N5.
 
10. 
I note that consuming
marijuana is considered a legal activity, and the Landlord
did not indicate that this was
a designated non-smoking residential complex.
Therefore these allegations are dismissed.
 
11.  Finally, what remains in the N5 are the
allegations of shouting, screaming from inside his own rental unit, and
unproven allegations about how this had been affecting other tenants. In the absence
of direct evidence
to support the allegations, the testimony of the
Landlord is hearsay at best, particularly as his testimony consisted of general
statements and not specifics.




 
12.  On a balance
of probabilities, I was not satisfied that the Landlord
had proven that the
Tenant has substantially interfered with other Tenants reasonable enjoyment.
 
13.  The Landlord also served an N7 on February 3, 2021, setting
out in less detail the same
allegations contained in the two N5 notices.
 
14.  The Landlord served
both an N5 and an N7 for the same conduct. The N5 notices
afford a Tenant an opportunity to void the notice by correcting the
alleged behaviour. By serving an N7
for the same conduct, that voiding opportunity is taken away from the Tenant. I am satisfied that the alleged conduct is
properly addressed with the N5 notices and that the service on an N7 was
excessive and unnecessary.
 
15.  Even if I am wrong regarding the service of
an N5 and an N7 for the same alleged conduct,
for the same reasons as set out above for the N5, the N7 allegations are also
unproven.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord application is dismissed,
