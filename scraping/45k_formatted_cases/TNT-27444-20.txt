Between:

and


 




 


Sterling Karamar Property Management Agnes Toros
Carlos (unkown)


Landlords



 
 
 
Karl Smyth (the
'Tenant') applied for an order determining that Agnes Toros, Carlos (unkown)
and Sterling Karamar Property Management (the 'Landlords') or the
Landlords' superintendent/agent entered the rental unit illegally.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 18, 2021.
 
The Tenant, the Landlord’s agent L. Antpniado and the Landlord’s representative, S. Beard attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenant’s
application is a T2 Application, brought pursuant to s.29(1) Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), which alleges that the
landlords, or the Landlords’ superintendent/agent entered the rental unit
illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the
rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant.
 
2.   
The monthly rent is
$785.53.
 
3.   
The Tenant
testified he was unable to enter his unit upon his return home late in the
evening on July 15, due to a sliding deadbolt lock malfunction. Upon reporting the matter to the Landlord,
the Tenant stayed elsewhere for the night and returned to the rental unit the
following day to discover that the locksmith had opened the door and covered
the hole on the door created to access the rental unit, with a particle board
screwed to the door.




 
Entry without notice
 
4.   
The Tenant
alleges there was an illegal entry to his unit on August 6, 2020. On this date, the Tenant testified he
heard a knock on his door from the Landlord’s building representative and
another individual who advised they wanted to take measurements of his door. The Tenant stated the visit was
unannounced and he felt his privacy was violated
as he was only partially dressed at the time.
He stated he ultimately allowed the Landlord to take the measurements,
at which time, he says he was given a 24-hour notice form. The Tenant testified that the entry caused
him cognitive stress.
 
5.   
While it is
certainly preferable that the Landlord provide reasonable advanced notice prior
to requesting entry, section 26(1) of the Act provides that a landlord may enter a
rental unit without written notice
if the tenant consents to the entry at the time of entry. I find that this is what happened here
when the Tenant opened the door and allowed the visitors to enter his unit.
 
Sub Interference
 
6.   
The Tenant
testified he was initially told by the Landlord’s building representative that
the door would arrive by August 10, only to be told shortly thereafter by
another building representative, that it would “take longer”.
 
7.   
Ultimately, the
door was replaced on October 13, 2020, after a total of 88 days. The Tenant states the current arrangement
caused him stress due to the lack of security provided by a “broken”
door. The Tenant feared someone with a “screwdriver” could break into his
apartment while he was sleeping. While the Tenant submitted he suffered mental
anguish, there was no medical documentation produced to substantiate the impact
 
8.   
The Landlord’s
agent testified that the delay was caused by supply issues during the pandemic,
and that the door is a “fire-rated door” making it a special order. The Landlord also testified there was no
malicious intent, and in fact, a second contractor was retained since that
company could do the job quicker that the first contractor.
 
9.   
While the pandemic and supply issues certainly could
impact the time to complete the door replacement, I find a reasonable time
frame during the circumstances would have been approximately 1 month and the
impact of the delay had some disruption to the Tenant’s normal ability
to reside in the unit.
I find that an approximate 15% abatement is appropriate for the delay beyond the initial 30 days, for a
total abatement of $225.00.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant the sum of $225.00.
 
2.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by February 18, 2022, the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
3.    
The Tenant has the right, at any time,
to collect the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
