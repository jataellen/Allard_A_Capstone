Chad Cole


Tenant



 
 
 
On December 6, 2021, Thomas Cavanagh Construction Limited. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Chad Cole (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
and the Tenant signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: EAL-99082-21
 
 
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
