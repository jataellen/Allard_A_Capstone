Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-89175-17










 
 

AR
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BL (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on November 14, 2017 and February 7, 2018.
 
The
Landlord attended the hearing and was represented by MY, licensed paralegal.
The Tenant attended the hearing and was self-represented.
 
BJ
appeared as a witness for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary
Matters
 
1.      At the
conclusion of the hearing, the parties agreed to provide me with their written
submissions on all issues raised during the hearing. I directed the Landlord’s
legal representative to provide his written submissions to the Board by
February 21, 2018, with a copy to the Tenant. The Tenant was directed to
provide his written reply submissions to the Board and to the Landlord’s representative
by March 7, 2018. The Landlord’s legal representative submitted his written
submissions on time; however, as at the date of this order, the Board did not
receive any written submissions from the Tenant. 
2.      At the
outset of the February 7th sitting, the Tenant requested an
adjournment because, as he stated, he did not receive four items of disclosure
from the Landlord’s legal representative. The Landlord’s representative
provided a receipt showing the said disclosure was sent to the unit, via Canada
Post express post, on January 24, 2018. Based on the evidence presented, I was
satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, the Landlord’s representative had the
disclosure delivered to the unit on the date stated. Nevertheless, while I
denied the Tenant’s adjournment request, I held the matter down and gave the
Tenant ample time to review the documents. 
3.      While the
Tenant provided late disclosure to the Landlord on February 7th, the
Landlord’s representative stated the Landlord was, nonetheless, ready to proceed.
4.      I should
also note, at this point, that I provided a copy of the Ontario Court of
Appeal’s decision in 1162994 Ontario Inc. v. Bakker, 2004 CanLII 59995
(ON CA) (“Bakker”) to the Tenant at the outset of the hearing on
February 7th as the Tenant stated he was not familiar with the
decision and the Landlord’s representative stated he was relying on the
decision. I again held the matter down to accord the Tenant an opportunity to
review the decision.
5.      Towards
the conclusion of the hearing, the Tenant stated he wished to raise maintenance
and other issues in relation to the unit. The Tenant is within his rights, on
an application such as this, to raise issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). However, here, and as I stated during the
hearing, the Tenant waited until the eleventh hour to mention his intention in
this regard and
had not provided the Landlord, prior to the hearing, with notice or disclosure
in relation to the issue(s) he wished to raise at the hearing. The Tenant did
not, however, allege the issues he intended to raise amounted to a serious
breach of the Landlord’s obligations under the Act so as to require the Board
to dismiss the Landlord’s application outright under s. 83(3). 
6.      While I
declined to hear the Tenant’s submissions and evidence with respect to the
section 82 issue(s), as I stated during the hearing, it is open to the Tenant
to bring to the Board his own tenant application(s) concerning any tenant
issues, in relation to disrepair in the unit or otherwise, and he may wish to
consult with Tenant Duty Counsel for assistance in this connection. 
The
Landlord’s Application
7.      The Tenant
is in possession of the unit.
8.      The unit
is a portion of a semi-detached, two-storey, house in Toronto. The Tenant moved
into the unit on or about July 1, 2016 and, on or about that date, he and BJ, a
tenant of the unit at that time, executed a lease with the Landlord. The lease
names a third tenant of the unit, JK, however, the copy of the lease presented
by the Landlord does not bear JK’s signature. The Landlord’s evidence was JK
had vacated the unit before the Tenant executed the lease. 
9.      BJ
testified he lived in the unit “from November, 2014 to the end of July, 2017.”
10.   Shortly
after the Tenant and BJ executed the lease with the Landlord, another
individual “AL” moved into the unit. The Landlord testified AL refused to sign
the lease.
11.   The
Landlord’s affirmed and uncontradicted evidence was AL moved into the unit on
August 1, 2016 and vacated the unit on June 30, 2017 and BJ vacated the unit
“at the end of July, 2017.” The Landlord added he was advised, in early
September, 2017 and via telephone, by BJ and AL, that they had vacated
the unit. The Landlord’s evidence was partly corroborated by BJ, who testified
he vacated the unit “at the end of July, 2017” and advised the Landlord in this
regard in late August/early September, 2017.
12.   On
November 24, 2017, AL paid $1,600.00 to the Landlord for arrears of rent. On
December 7, 2017, the Landlord received a payment from BJ, for arrears of rent,
in the sum of $761.37. BJ testified he made the said payment to the Landlord to
contribute towards the outstanding arrears of rent because he “felt bad about
the situation.”
13.   BJ
testified the lease he, the Tenant and the Landlord executed on or about July
1, 2016 was for the entire unit. BJ further testified the Tenant was aware,
when he signed the lease, that it was for the entire house and the monthly rent
was $2,100.00 because the lease is clear in this regard. The parties agreed the
Tenant, BJ and AL usually paid the rent separately, and each in the sum of
$700.00, to the Landlord.
14.   The
Landlord’s position is when existing tenants of the unit bring in a new tenant,
a new lease starts predicated on terms all parties agree to. The Landlord testified
there are “no new terms; only new dates and new parties.” The Landlord added
the Tenant’s lease only pertained to the Tenant and BL and separate and
overlapping tenancies were not created during the material time.
15.   While it
is more difficult to ascertain the entirety of the Tenant’s position as he
failed to provide written submissions as directed, based on the Tenant’s direct
testimony and questions he put to the Landlord and BJ, it appears the Tenant
alleges the tenancy here is a tenancy in common, whereby he is solely
responsible for a monthly rent in the sum of $700.00, and, if the tenancy is a
joint tenancy, the N4 is defective and the within application must be
dismissed, as BJ is not named as a respondent tenant.    
16.   With respect to
whether the tenancy here is a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, my
consideration of this issue is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
An issue is res judicata if it has already been settled by a prior
order. It stops a party from being able to seek another order on the same
issue. In effect, it prevents a “second kick at the can”. Three elements must
be present for res judicata to apply. First, there must be an earlier
decision on the issue. Second, that decision must be final in that it has not
been reviewed or appealed. Thirdly, the same parties must be involved.
17.   In this case, it is
clear that the same parties were involved in a prior application in Board file
TSL-80287-16, and in this application. It is also clear that order TSL-80287-16
is a final decision since neither a review nor an appeal was filed. In
TSL-80287-16, issued on April 20, 2017, Member Flynn found, at paragraph 4, as
follows:
“One tenancy exists in these circumstances
between the Landlord and the Tenants, commenced by a written lease agreement.”
18.   And at paragraph 8:
“With neither the Landlord nor another
tenant of the residential complex being substantially interfered with, the
application based upon the N5 must fail.   The Tenants, for the purposes of
the tenancy, are an indivisible whole.  Without any complaint of the effect
on the Landlord or another tenant, no one else – except the Tenants – is
affected by the behaviour of – the Tenants.”  [Emphasis added] 
19.   Therefore, the Tenant
and BJ entered into a joint tenancy together and, as stated above, the rent is
$2,100.00 per month. BJ and the Tenant remain collectively liable for that
amount every month until the tenancy is terminated. The law does not allow
for apportionment of the liability for arrears. The full rent is owed and
the Tenant and BJ are jointly and severally liable.
20.   With respect to
whether the N4 notice is defective as BJ is not mentioned as a respondent
tenant in the within application, the real issue is whether BJ was in
possession of the unit at the time the Landlord filed the within application on
September 29, 2017. As already stated, the Landlord’s and BJ’s uncontradicted
evidence was BJ vacated the unit in late July, 2017. AL, if she was a tenant of
the unit, which is to a large extent immaterial, vacated the unit in late June,
2017. Based on the evidence presented I find, on a balance of probabilities,
neither BJ, nor AL exercised any control over the unit at the time the
application was filed, had access to the unit, used the unit for any purpose,
or otherwise had a connection to it.
21.   The leading case on
the meaning of “in possession” is the Court of Appeal’s decision in Bakker.
The Court states, at paragraphs 18 to 22, as follows:
[18]…I think the requirement that the tenant
be "in possession of the rental unit" at the time of the application
reflects a determination that rent arrears disputes can be resolved efficiently
and fairly through the Tribunal where the tenant at the time of the application
continues to have some connection with the rental unit and, therefore, some
relationship with the landlord. Situations where that connection has been
severed and the relationship gone are best resolved through the more formal
court processes. 
[19] Some further assistance in defining
"tenant in possession" is found by an examination of s. 86(2). That
subsection provides that a landlord may be compensated for "the use and
occupation" of a rental unit after notice of termination of the lease. A
landlord can only be compensated, however, if the tenant is "in possession
of the rental unit" when the landlord's application is made. This suggests
that a "tenant in possession" is a person who was using or occupying
the rental unit at the time of the application but does not necessarily
indicate that the phrase is limited to users and occupiers. 
[20] Possession is a difficult concept to
define. Both in common and legal parlance, it connotes some form of control
over the thing said to be possessed: e.g. D. Dukelow, B. Nuse, The Dictionary
of Canadian Law 2nd ed., (1995) Carswell at p. 916; The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary, Vol. II (1973) p. 1635. Clearly, possession in s. 86(1)(b) is not
limited to immediate physical control. For example, a tenant who locks up a
rental unit and leaves on an extended vacation, continues to exercise sufficient
control over that rental unit so as to qualify as a "tenant in
possession" for the purposes of s. 86(1)(b). In my view, possession of a
rental unit refers to some form of control over that unit as demonstrated by
factors such as access to, use of, or occupation of the unit. 
[21] There will be cases, although I would
not think a great many, where a determination of whether the tenant was
"in possession of the rental unit" at the time of the application
will raise a difficult issue. In those cases, the Tribunal will have to decide,
based on the evidence, whether there is a sufficient connection between the
rental unit and the tenant to permit a finding that the tenant was "in
possession" of that rental unit. 
[22] In this case, there was no connection between
Bakker and the rental unit at the time the s. 86 application was commenced.
Bakker exercised no control over that unit. He had unequivocally, completely,
and permanently vacated the unit more than two years before the application. 
22.   As such the Landlord
is solely required to name the Tenant in the application as he was the only
tenant in possession of the rental unit, when the application was filed.
23.   The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
April 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 27, 2017.
24.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,100.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
25.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 1,
2016 to September 27, 2017.
26.   The Tenant
paid $5,861.37 after the application was filed.
Section 83
Relief
27.   Again, as
the Tenant did not provide written submissions going to the issues raised
during the hearing and section 83 relief from eviction, I am left only with the
Tenant’s testimony and other evidence adduced by the parties during the
hearing. At the conclusion of the first sitting, I asked the Tenant if he was
able to pay the monthly rent to the Landlord until the matter returned and the
Tenant stated he was financially unable to pay the monthly rent for the unit in
the sum of $2,100.00. The Tenant stated he was able to pay $700.00 per month
and, in fact, did so since the outset of these proceedings. It seems clear the
Tenant is unable, on his own, to continue the tenancy. On the other hand, the
Landlord is losing a significant amount of money each month while continuing to
make the necessary ongoing payments, for property taxes, mortgage et cetera, to
maintain the residential complex. The Tenant has resided in the unit for almost
two years and should be accorded a reasonable amount of time to find new
accommodation.
28.   Having
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it
would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 21, 2018 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The extension of the termination date, and the
usual delay in enforcement, will allow the Tenant an ample opportunity to find
new accommodation. This is especially so as, since at least late September,
2017, the Tenant ought to have been aware there was a chance his tenancy would
come to an end and, accordingly, he should have been taking steps to find
alternate accommodation in the event he is unable to void my order, below.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 21, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,319.95*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 22, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 23, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
2, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 21, 2018, then starting April 22,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 22, 2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $15,328.63 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $17,428.63 if the payment is made on or before April 21, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 22, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
