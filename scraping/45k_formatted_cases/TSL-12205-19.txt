Order under Section
126
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 
 
 
UOTHA (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order permitting the rent charged to be increased by more than
the guideline for one or more of the rental units in the residential complex.
 
This application was resolved by written hearing.
No submissions were received from the
Tenant.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
justified a rent increase above
the guideline because
of capital expenditures.
 
2.                 
The maximum
rent increase above the guideline
because of capital
expenditure is 9.00%. This increase is for the capital
expenditure for Exterior Painting.
 
3.                 
The
Landlord submits the claimed costs are eligible under s.126(7)(a) and (b) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”) because the work was
necessary to protect and restore the physical integrity of the residential complex, and was required to comply
with housing and maintenance standards.
Conclusion
 
4.                 
I find
the claimed capital expenditure is an eligible capital expenditure that
satisfies the requirements of s.126(7)(a) and (b) of Act.
I find the Landlord is entitled to the amounts claimed for the entirety of the
work claimed in the application.
 
5.                 
The weighted
useful life for the capital
expenditure is 10 years.




6.                 
The first effective date of the rent increase above the guideline is March 1, 2020.
 
7.                 
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order within 30 days of
the date of this order.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
may increase the rent charged by 9.00% for the unit
set out in the order.
 
2.                 
The percentage increase set out in paragraph 1 is to be taken as follows:

the time period
of March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021;

5.                 
If the Tenant’s rent is
increased pursuant to the percentage increase ordered for capital expenditures and the same Tenant remains
in the unit after the expiration of the weighted useful life for capital expenditures, then the rent will be reduced. Refer to Schedule 1

Important Notes:
 
1.                 
The landlord
may increase the rent charged
by the ordered increase within
the time period specified if at least 12 months
have passed since the last rent increase or since the tenant moved in, and if
the landlord has given the tenant at least 90 days proper Notice of Rent
Increase. Any part of the ordered
increase that is not taken within the time period specified cannot be added to
subsequent rent increases in subsequent time periods.
 
2.                 
If the landlord has given a Notice of Rent Increase
for a rent increase that is less than the ordered increase, the landlord may
only take the rent increase set out in the Notice.
 
3.                 
The ordered
increase does not affect tenants
who moved into the complex
on or after December 2, 2019. The
landlord cannot add the ordered increase to the rents these tenants pay.
