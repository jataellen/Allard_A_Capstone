Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: TSL-95864-18
 











 
 
 

S. C. L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict D. S. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent and did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
July 6, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
agents, A. G. and Vesna M., attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
2.     
This is a month to month
tenancy.
3.     
The Landlord’s ledger shows
that since January of 2017 the Tenant has paid the rent late at least 17 times.
Based on this pattern of late payment I find the Tenant has been persistently
late paying the rent. 
4.     
Pursuant to Board order
TSL-78000-16 the Board approved an above guideline rent increase of 0.87% for
the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. When this application came
before the Board I asked the Landlord to file additional information as to rent
increases taken since January 1, 2017 so I could calculate the rent arrears
owing and determine the validity of the Landlord’s notice of termination for
non-payment of rent. 
5.     
On July 13, 2018, I received
additional documents including copies of the Notices of Rent Increase (NORIs)
served on the Tenant effective March 1, 2017 and March 1, 2018. 
6.     
The documentation filed by
the Landlord shows that in January of 2017 the lawful monthly rent was $909.55.

7.     
In 2017 the guideline amount
was 1.7%. As Board order TSL-78000-16 authorised the Landlord to increase the
rent an additional 0.87%, the Landlord was entitled to increase the rent
effective March 1, 2017 up to a maximum of 2.57% or $932.92 subject to service
of a proper NORI. 
8.     
The notice of rent increase
served on the Tenant was for an amount less than the maximum permitted under
the Board’s order. It increased the lawful monthly rent to $928.75. As this
amount is less than the amount the Landlord was entitled to take as a result of
Board order TSL-78000-16, the NORI the Landlord served is valid and the lawful
monthly rent became $928.75 effective March 1, 2017.
9.     
The Landlord then served a
NORI for March 1, 2018. Although the NORI says it is for the annual guideline
amount of 1.8%, the dollar increase is actually for less. As a result of the
NORI, the lawful monthly rent increased from $928.75 to $938.93 effective March
1, 2018. 
10.   According to the Landlord’s ledger as of January
1, 2017 the Tenant had an outstanding balance owing of $285.32.
11.   The lawful monthly rent charged for the period
January 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018 totals $17,658.75 and is calculated as
follows:
For the period
January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2017 – 2 x $909.55 = $1,819.10;
For the period
March 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018 – 12 x $928.75 = $11,145.00;
For the period
March 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018 – 5 x $938.93 = $4,694.65.
12.   The Landlord’s ledger shows that during the same
period the Tenant paid a total of $16,170.00. Of that amount $175.00 was not
with respect to rent but rather was for a filing fee for a previous application
meaning the Tenant paid a total towards the rent of $15,995.00. 
13.   So the rent arrears owing for the period ending
July 31, 2018 total $285.32 + $17,658.75 - $15,995.00 = $1,949.07. 
14.   I would observe at this point that the notice of
termination for non-payment of rent is not valid as it does not accurately set
out the rent arrears owing as of the date the notice was served. It was served
on the Tenant on May 4, 2018. Board order TSL-78000-16 was issued on April 25,
2018, so the Landlord knew or ought to have known what retroactive rent
increase it was entitled to take, but the notice indicates on its face it does
not include the retroactive amount owing. 
15.   So the Landlord is entitled to an order
terminating the tenancy for persistent late payment, but not for rent arrears. However,
pursuant to s. 87(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
the Landlord is entitled to an order for the rent arrears owing. 
16.   The Landlord incurred costs of $190.00 for
filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.
17.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $935.05
from the Tenant and this deposit shall be applied to the rent due for the last
month of the tenancy pursuant to s. 106(10) of the Act. 
18.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 totalling $8.35.
This amount shall also be offset against the rent owing. 
19.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief from
eviction.
20.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of July 31, 2018 for persistent late
payment of the rent. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
July 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,005.67, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 16, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $30.87 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting August
1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before July 27, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 28,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 31, 2018, then starting August 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after August 1, 2018.
