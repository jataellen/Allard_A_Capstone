Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-52905-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


806, 60 CAPULET LANE LONDON ON N6H0B2


 




Between:


Drewlo Holdings Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shichen
You


Tenant



 
 
 
Drewlo Holdings
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Shichen You (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on September 9, 2021 at 9:00 a.m.
 
The Landlord, represented by Christina Phili, a licensed
Paralegal, and the Tenant, Shichen
You, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 31,
2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
was in possession of the rental unit when the application was
filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,339.00
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,339.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 25, 2020 to May 31, 2021.
 
6.    
As of the hearing
date the parties
agreed that the Tenant owed $2864.00 including arrears of rent to September 30,
2021 of $2,678.00 and the application filing fee of
$186.00. Since
the hearing, another four rental periods have begun, and four more month’s rent
have become due. Therefore, the amount in this order includes October 2021, November
2021, December 2021 and January
2022’s rent. If the Tenant
has paid the Landlord October
2021, November 2021, December 2021 and January 2022’s rent,




 
and /or made any payments
to the Landlord since the hearing,
the Landlord shall deduct those payments from the
amount owing in this order.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until September 23, 2021 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenant requested the additional time to
pay all outstanding arrears. The Landlord’s representative was amendable to
extending the eviction date to September 23, 2021. As this order is being
issued on January 13, 2022, this extension has been effectively already been
granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $8,652.28*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
13, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $44.02
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
24, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 25, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,559.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
25, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
