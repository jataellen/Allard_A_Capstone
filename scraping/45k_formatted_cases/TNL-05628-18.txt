Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05628-18
 



 


 


 



 
JK and JD (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict KMY (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation.  The Landlords also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 10,
2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant’s
representative, his daughter, JY, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
L9 Application for Rent
Arrears and Tenant’s Claim under s. 82:
 
1.     
The rental unit is the
basement of a raised bungalow.  The Landlords live in the upper part of the
house with the Landlords’ father, and two adult children.
 
2.     
The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The Tenant did not pay the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.
 
4.     
Pursuant to subsection 82(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), the Tenant’s
daughter JY, stated that the rental unit had no heat from December, 2017, to
March, 2018.  The Tenant informed the Landlords verbally, on at least two
occasions, that there was no heat in the rental unit, but they took no action. 
JY did not produce evidence of any temperature readings, nor did she present
any written or text requests to the Landlord to repair the heat.  She said that
as a result of the lack of heat, the Tenant purchased space heaters.  She
stated that the Landlords were aware of the space heaters because they had
entered the rental unit and disconnected them on one occasion because they
objected to the fire hazard they presented, and the extra electricity costs.  Because
of the loss of enjoyment of the rental property, JY submitted that the Tenant
sought a 33% rent abatement for the months of December, 2017, up to and
including March, 2018 (or 33% of $700.00 X 4 months = $933.32).
 
5.     
 The Landlord, JD, submitted
that there was no problem with the heating in the house.  He said he never
received a complaint about heating from the Tenant, nor did he ever disconnect
the Tenant’s space heaters because he was not aware they were present in the
house.
 
6.     
I do not find JY presented
sufficient evidence to prove that the Tenant had lived in the rental unit
without heating for four months.  She presented no temperature readings, nor
did she have evidence that the Tenant had informed the Landlord about a heating
problem.  I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Tenant has not
presented enough evidence to establish the existence of any heating problem, nor
evidence that the Tenant informed the Landlords about a potential heating
problem that they failed to address, in order to justify a rent abatement. 
Landlords’ Application to
Evict the Tenant for the Landlords’ Own use
 
7.     
The Landlords submitted an
affidavit that they, in good faith require possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.  JD said that his father currently lives
with them in the upper part of the house.  He has been living with them for 18
years.  The basement unit where the Tenant resides does not require the
occupant to climb steps to access the unit.  Currently, in the upper house, JD’s
father has 14 steps to climb to reach the house.  He now only has 60% heart
function and other health problems, so it is necessary for him to move into the
ground level rental unit.  JD submitted that he has repeatedly told the Tenant,
over a lengthy period of time, since January, 2018, that he requires the rental
unit for his ailing father.  He also stated that there is a great deal of
animosity between the Landlords and the Tenant at present.  JD also said that
JY does not live only on social assistance but has income from other sources.
 
8.     
At the hearing, the
Landlords presented compensation of one month’s rent ($700.00) to the Tenant’s
daughter, JY, pursuant to section 48.1 of the Act.
 
9.     
JY confirmed that the
Landlords had told the Tenant, over the past number of months, that JD’s family
requires the Tenant’s unit, saying that their own unit is cramped and the
family needs extra space.  The Tenant has lived in the rental unit for two
years and has been actively trying to find alternative accommodation within his
budget.  JY said the Tenant lives solely on social assistance and has a very
restricted budget.  The Tenant, she said, also has health problems, and cannot
live any place that has a lot of steps.  Because of his limited income and
circumstances, the Tenant needs a further three months to find a new rental
unit.
 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Landlords
require the rental unit, which is on ground level, for JD’s ailing father.  The
Landlords intend to inhabit the Tenant’s residential unit for at least 12
months.  The Tenant has had ample notice to find an alternative accommodation
within his budget.  However, I find that it would not be prejudicial to the
Landlords to permit the Tenant to stay in the unit until the end of August,
2018.  I find, therefore, that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction
until August 31, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $700.00, which represents the amount of rent owing up to June 30,
2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing on or before August 4, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from August 5,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of August 31, 2018. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before August 31, 2018.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords on or after September 1, 2018.
