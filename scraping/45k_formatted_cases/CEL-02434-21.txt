Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-02434-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


UNIT 3, 28 MATCHEDASH STREET
N ORILLIA ON L3V4T5


 




Between:


Nicholas Blease-Trepanier


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sarah-Ann Barron


Tenant



 
 
 
Nicholas Blease-Trepanier (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Sarah-Ann Barron (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 16, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Nicole
Fazzari, and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 8, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a
termination date of November 30, 2021. The N12 seeks termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Landlord requires
the rental unit for residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord
paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on September
16, 2021.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,450.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Landlord
offered to pay an extra
month’s rent as additional compensation to help the Tenant with moving costs. This amount
will be applied to the rent for February 2022.
 
Good Faith
 
6.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section
48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act). Section 48(1) requires that, in
order to be successful in this application, the Landlord




 
must establish
that at the time of the service
of the N12 he required,
in good faith, the unit for residential use.
 
7.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where the Court held that the “good faith” requirement
simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The
Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
8.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the
motives of the Landlord are, per
Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the conduct and motives of
the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy
the property.
 
9.    
The Landlord
recently purchased the property and wants to move in. He is currently
renting a unit elsewhere until he can move into his own property.
 
10.  At the hearing,
the Tenant could not provide
sufficient reasons that the Landlord
was acting in bad faith by requiring the rental unit for personal use.
 
11.  Therefore,
I am satisfied, based on the Landlord’s evidence, that he genuinely intends
to live in the rental unit for at least one year. I find that the
Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
Relief From Eviction
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
The Landlord’s Legal Representative consented to the Tenant’s request to stay
until the end of February 2022.
 
13.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter
and no further reasons will be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of February 28, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Landlord
will credit the Tenant $1,450.00 which will be applied to the last month's
rent owing.
 
3.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




 
4.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
