Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03190-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


106, 180 MISSISSAUGA VALLEY BOULEVARD
  MISSISSAUGA ON L5A3M2


 




Between:


Kaukab Usman


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Rodney Davidson


Tenant



 
 
 
Kaukab Usman (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Rodney Davidson (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on January
27, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Kerlan McLean, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The signed a 1st N5 notice on September
4, 2021. The certificate of service was signed
on October 4, 2022 but shows no date when the N5 was served. The application was filed with the Board
on October 7, 2021. Based on this
information it cannot be determined if the Landlord filed the application with
the Board after the 7-day voiding period for the notice.
 
2.     The Landlord’s representative submits there was a 2nd N5 notice served on the Tenant in December 2021. This was after the application was filed.
 
3.     At the hearing
the Landlord testified that the Tenant
voided the 1st N5 notice.
 
4.     As the notice
was voided and the application was filed with the Board
based on a voided
notice, the Landlord’s application has no chance of success.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
