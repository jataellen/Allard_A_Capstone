Review Order
 
 
MC (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
MA (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-19891-19 issued on November
22, 2019.
 
On July 27, 2020, the Tenant
requested a review of the order
and that the order be stayed until the request to review the order is
resolved.
 
On August 20, 2020,
interim order
TNL-19891-19-RV-IN was issued,
staying the order
issued on November 22, 2019.
 
The Tenant says he was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing
that took place
on November 19, 2019.
 
The request for review
was heard via video conference on October 2, 2020, January 26, 2021, May 6,
2021, October 28, 2021, and January 13, 2022.

the hearing:
•        
The Landlord’s legal representative, SK;
•        
The Landlord’s witness, AB;
•        
The Landlord’s witness, DP;
•        
The Tenant;
•        
The Tenant’s legal representative, RM; and
•        
The Tenant’s witness, CL.




 
Determinations:
 
The Request for Review
 
1.    
At the hearing, I granted the
Tenant’s request for review because I am satisfied that he did not receive
notice of the hearing and was therefore not reasonably able to participate in the hearing that took place on November
19, 2019. I then proceeded to hear the merits
of the Landlord’s application for non-payment of rent.
 
The Landlord’s Application
 
2.    
There is no dispute that the
Tenant failed to pay rent for August 2019 and the Landlord served an N4 notice
of termination under the door on August 26, 2019. The date of termination on
the notice is September 11, 2019. The Landlord then filed an L1 application for non-payment of rent on September 15, 2019. At some point,
the Landlord discovered that
the Tenant had moved out of the rental unit and the Landlord re-rented the unit for March
1, 2020. The Landlord is claiming rent arrears
and daily compensation for the period of August 1, 2019, to February 29,
2020. For the following reasons, I find that the Landlord’s application should
be dismissed.
 
a) When Did the Tenant
Move Out?
 
3.    
First, there is some dispute regarding precisely when the Tenant moved out of the rental unit. For the following reasons, I
find that the Tenant moved out on September 1, 2019.
 
4.    
While the Tenant provided
testimony on this point, I do not find the Tenant to be credible. The Tenant’s testimony was
internally inconsistent and it tended to evolve over time. Also, during cross
examination and in light of the Landlord’s witnesses, several aspects of the Tenant’s testimony
turned out not to be plausible and, for all of
these reasons, I do
not find the Tenant to be a credible witness.
 
5.    
In contrast to the Tenant’s
testimony, the testimony from the Tenant’s witness, ‘CL’, was detailed,
consistent and credible throughout the hearing. Even the Landlord’s legal
representative commented on the reliability of CL’s testimony at the hearing.
For this reason, I find that CL’s testimony
persuasive regarding when the Tenant
moved out of the
rental unit.
 
6.    
CL was a previous landlord to the
Tenant and he knew that the Tenant had a particular love for the basement unit
in one of his properties. CL reached out to the Tenant in mid July 2019 to advise him that the basement
unit may become available.
The conversations at this point were
preliminary in nature and neither party made any commitments to enter into a
new lease agreement at this point. Then, at the beginning of August 2019, CL
sent a text message to the Tenant informing him that the basement unit was
available to rent and it was his if he wanted it. The Tenant wrote back
immediately and expressed an interest in the unit. The two met on August 24,
2019, to sign a lease agreement and obtain the keys. CL says that the Tenant
then moved into the basement of his complex on
September 1, 2019. CL provided text messages to support his testimony as well
as the new lease agreement. CL also
described the dates and details of how and when the




 
other
residents in the building
moved to make room
for the Tenant. All of CL’s testimony regarding the dates and details of this time period lead me to find that the Tenant moved
into the new rental unit on September 1, 2019.
 
b) The Outstanding Arrears
 
7.    
In deciding the Tenant’s
liability regarding the outstanding arrears,
I am guided by the principles contained in subsection
134(1.1) which says:
 
1.1 No landlord shall, directly or indirectly, with respect
to any rental unit, collect or require or attempt to collect or require from a
former tenant of the rental unit any amount of money purporting to be rent in
respect of,
(a)     
any period after the
tenancy has terminated and the tenant has vacated the rental unit; or
(b)     
any period after the
tenant’s interest in the tenancy has terminated and the tenant has vacated the
rental unit.
 
8.    
Section 134 was specifically
amended to include this new provision which prohibits landlords from collecting rent from former tenants after they have vacated the rental unit. I
find that this subsection applies directly to the matter before me. As the
Tenant moved out of the rental unit
on September 1, 2019, the Landlord was not permitted to file the application,
the Board does not have the jurisdiction to hear the Landlord’s application and
it must be dismissed.
 
9.    
I have also considered Guideline
11 of the Board’s Interpretation Guidelines. I find that Guideline 11 applies squarely
to the facts before me and, although
it is not binding, I see
no reason to depart from it in this instance. Guideline 11 says:
 
The tenant must be in
possession of the rental unit on the
date the landlord files the L1 Application.
 
The Ontario Court of Appeal found in 1162994
Ontario Inc. Bakker, 2004 CanLII 59995 (ON CA), that a tenant is "in possession" of a
rental unit where the tenant exercises some "form of control over that
unit as demonstrated by factors such as access to, use of, or occupation of the
unit. The landlord is expected to be able to provide evidence about efforts
made to determine whether the tenant is still in possession of the unit.
Such evidence may include:
 
•Whether the tenant returned
keys to the landlord;
•Whether the
tenant gave a notice to the landlord or it is otherwise clear that the tenant
intends to move out;
•Whether
utility service to the unit has been disconnected and the unit has been without
gas or electricity for some time prior to the hearing;
•Whether the
tenant has actually been observed moving out of the unit by the landlord or
others;




 
•Whether the landlord has
changed the locks and/or taken steps to re-rent the unit.
 
If the tenant has moved out of the rental unit but
still owes rent arrears, the landlord cannot file an L1 Application but may be able to
claim rent arrears by filing an Application to Collect Rent the Former Tenant
Owes (L10 Application) instead. [Emphasis added]
 
10. 
Although I find that the Tenant failed to return the keys
to the Landlord, I also find that the Landlord failed to take
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Tenant was still in possession of the rental unit before they
filed the L1 application on September 15, 2019. During the hearing, the
Landlord’s property manager admitted that he made no efforts to ensure that the
Tenant was still in possession of the rental unit before submitting
documentation to their legal counsel to file the L1 application. The property
manager did not serve a 24-hour notice of entry to inspect the rental unit, he
did not knock on the door of the rental
unit, and he made no efforts
to determine whether
the Tenant had moved out after the N4 notice of termination
was served. The property manager tried to excuse his inaction by blaming the
size of the complex and the number of rental units that are constantly being
served with notices of termination. However,
regardless of the size of the
complex, the Act and the Board’s Guidelines make it incumbent upon the Landlord
to determine whether the Tenant is in possession of the rental unit before
filing an L1 application for non-payment of rent.
 
11. 
Even the L1 Application form itself requires the Landlord to indicate whether
the Tenant is still in possession of the rental unit.
The form also reminds the Landlord that “if you answer no, you cannot file this
application”. In short, as the Tenant moved out on September 1, 2019, he was not in possession when the Landlord
filed the application and the Board does not have the jurisdiction to hear the
application. As the Board lacks the jurisdiction to hear the Landlord’s
application, it must be dismissed.
 
12. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision.
No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
