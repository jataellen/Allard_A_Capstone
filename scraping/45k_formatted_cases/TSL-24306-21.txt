Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24306-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


610, 2 MURRAY
STREET TORONTO ON M5T1T7


 




Between:


Ricardo Briscoe
St Clare's Multifaith Housing Society


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Birhanu Kebede


Tenant



 
 
 
Ricardo Briscoe and St Clare's Multifaith Housing Society (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Birhanu Kebede (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Tina Le, attended the hearing. As of 11:10
a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective
September 17, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $776.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $500.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




File Number: TSL-24306-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $6,090.25*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 18, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $25.51 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 19,
2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount
owing* on or before March
1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in
trust:
i)               
$6,570.00 if the payment
is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,346.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not
make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
