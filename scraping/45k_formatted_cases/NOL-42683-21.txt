and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Cory Zoep


 



 
 
Marcel
Lamontagne (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Cory Zoep (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on November 18, 2021 and January 28,
2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, K. Gervis attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Landlord
appeared unsure of the total amount owing, initially giving an amount far less
than what is contained in this order. However, since the Landlord maintained
that the Tenant made no payments, other than $400.00 on the date the application was filed, and the Tenant
was not present to contest the Landlord’s evidence,
the order is issued based
on the sole testimony of the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from March 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 2, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $550.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant paid $400.00
to the Landlord on April
26, 2021.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $550.00 from
the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from April 12, 2021 to February 2, 2020.




 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act. The Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were
unsuccessful as the Tenant failed to communicate with the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant
voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 21, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,936.69*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 10,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $18.08 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit
is not vacated on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February 22, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 22, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 21, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $5,861.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 22, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
