Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-10701-17
 











 
 

The Landlord applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict JS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Windsor on
February 7, 2018.  The Landlord’s Agent, RM attended the hearing along with the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, KP.  The Tenant attended the hearing along
with the Tenant's witness, TI.  
 
 At the hearing the Tenant raised the following
issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'):  Lack of adequate heat in the rental unit.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2017 to
February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective November 21, 2017.
2.    The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.    The monthly rent is $695.00.
4.    The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
5.    The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed. 
6.   
The Tenant testified that
when she moved into the rental unit May 31, 2017, the heat was still on so she
contacted the Landlord to have it turned off.  The Tenant said she was out when
the Landlord came and the heat was no longer on when she returned to the rental
unit.  
7.   
The Tenant said that when
the fall came, she had no heat in the kitchen, her son’s heater did not work
properly nor did the heater in the bathroom.  The Tenant said she contacted the
Landlord several times in the fall without response.  In January the Tenant
said her boyfriend removed the cover of the heater in the kitchen and notice
that some wires had been cut. (Exhibit #1).  The Tenant said she again
contacted the Landlord and they sent a maintenance person to the rental unit. 
According to the Tenant, the maintenance person looked at the heater and said
he would return but never did.  The Tenant said she still does not have heat in
the kitchen and sometimes it is so cold she can see her breath.  The Tenant was
seeking a 50% abatement.  
8.   
RM, the Landlord’s Agent,
testified the Tenant told them they learned about the heating issue mid
January.  RM said he sent their maintenance person to the rental unit on  January
17, 2018 and found the wires had been cut in the kitchen baseboard heater.  RM
said they responded by serving the Tenant a N5 Notice for wilful damage of the
heater.   The notice required the Tenant to pay for the repair.  The Landlord
said to date the Tenant has failed to pay to have the heater repaired and the
Landlord has not repaired the heater.  
9.   
Based on the evidence before
me, I find the Landlord has failed to maintain the rental unit under section 20
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.  I accept the evidence of the
Tenant that she told the Landlord about the heat issue in the fall and the
Landlord did not respond.  It is the Landlord’s obligation to maintain the
baseboard heaters in the rental unit regardless of whether the Tenant caused
the wire to be cut or not. Instead of repairing the heater, the Landlord served
the Tenant with a N5 Notice telling her to pay for the repair.  
10. Although the Tenant was seeking a 50% abatement,
I find the Tenant did have heat in several of the rooms.  However, there was
inadequate heat in the kitchen, the bathroom and her son’s bedroom. I find a
20% abatement for three months is reasonable in the circumstances.  I find the
Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent of $417.00 of the rent for
inadequate heat in the rental unit for a period of three months.   The Landlord
was ordered at the hearing to repair the heaters by February 8, 2018. 
11. The Tenant paid $400.00 after the application
was filed.
12. The Tenant said she did not have all of the rent
to pay and had her son living with her.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until February 28, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act.  This will allow the Tenant to either access other funding to pay
the rent, or find alternative accommodations.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord shall repair
the baseboard heaters in the rental unit on or before February 8, 2018.
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February
28, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $999.41*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit and less the amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the
Tenant.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $22.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 13, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 28, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2018.
9.     
If, on or before February
28, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $2,103.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
10.   The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
