Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-91302-17
 
 
 
 
C.P.L
(the 'Landlord') applied, to the Landlord and Tenant Board (the “Board”), for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.S (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on January 22, 2018.
 
The
Landlord was represented by C.L, licensed paralegal. The Tenant attended the
hearing and was self-represented. The Tenant consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the hearing.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.      The
Tenant remains in possession of the rental unit and the monthly rent is
$1,204.87.
2.      The
Tenant has not paid $2,409.74 of the total rent the Tenant was required to pay
for the period from November 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
3.      The
Tenant also owes the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The
total amount
owing is $2,579.74 ($2,409.74 + $190.00).
5.      The
Landlord’s legal representative requested a standard order giving the Tenant
eleven days to void the order by paying the total amount outstanding and
continuing the tenancy.
6.      The Tenant
requested a payment plan, whereby she would reduce her arrears debt to the
Landlord, including the filing fee, to zero by July 20, 2018.
7.      The Tenant
worked at a call centre of a major bank until October 31, 2017, when she lost
her job. She subsequently applied for EI benefits. The Tenant started receiving
EI benefits, in the sum of approximately $700.00, in early December, 2017.
8.      In the
meantime, the Tenant secured new permanent full-time employment doing packaging
in a factory, earning $480.00 per week. As well, the Tenant receives $500.00
per month in child tax credit benefits and stated she will apply such income to
the arrears payments. 
9.      In my
view, a conditional order is warranted given the circumstances presented. The
Tenant paid $1,204.87 to the Landlord after the application was filed, which
is, in my view, a significant good faith payment in light of the Tenant’s
current financial situation. The Tenant and her fifteen-year-old daughter have
resided in the unit since 2009. The Tenant, who is a single parent, testified
her daughter attends school in the area. No evidence was presented the parties
have, in the past, appeared before the Board in relation to arrears issues,
although the Tenant acknowledged this may have occurred a few years back. 
10.   It was
clear during the hearing the Tenant very much wishes to remain in the unit and
was a credible witness. Her credibility was evident when she
acknowledged, against interest, the parties may have come before the Board a
few years ago, on arrears issues, notwithstanding no evidence in this regard was
presented by the Landlord.
11.   In most cases, the Board
will consider a payment plan—even if not requested by the tenant. However, in
ordering a payment plan, I have to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities,
the imposed payment plan, with respect to the arrears, would meet with a
reasonable chance of success as would the Tenant’s ability to pay the monthly
rent, in full and on time, in the future. Here, I am so satisfied. The monthly
rent is $1,204.87 and the Tenant earns $1,920.00 per month from her current
employment, which income is supplemented by the child tax credit payments, in
the sum of $500.00 per month. 
12.   Moreover,
the Tenant’s minor daughter will likely be adversely affected, through no fault
of her own, by the termination of this tenancy. The child likely has friends in
the neighbourhood and in the complex. Equally important, a housing disruption midway
through the school year will, in all likelihood, have an adverse
effect on the child’s studies. It is commonplace, and indeed
required by Baker v. MCI
1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, that I take into account the best
interests of children who are directly affected by a subsection 83(1) analysis.
Given all the facts presented, am of the opinion that it is in the
best interests of this minor child to remain in the unit.
13.   If
the Tenant makes the rent and arrears payments as ordered, the Landlord will
not be unduly prejudiced, given that failure to do so would authorize the
Landlord to seek to have the tenancy terminated and the Tenant evicted, without
further notice to the Tenant. 
14.   Having
considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out
in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant shall pay the Landlord $2,599.74 as
follows:                                                      
a)
$450.00, on or before February 20, 2018;
b) $450.00,
on or before March 20, 2018;
c) $450.00,
on or before April 20, 2018;
d) $450.00,
on or before May 20, 2018;
e)
$450.00, on or before June 20, 2018;
f) $349.74,
on or before July 20, 2018;
2.      The
Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord rent owing as follows:
a) for the month of February,
2018, no later than February 2, 2018; and
b) commencing March,
2018 and up to July, 2018, inclusive, no later than the first day of the month.
3.      If the
Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the
outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the Tenant
to the Landlord pursuant to paragraphs 1 or 2 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after January 31, 2018.
