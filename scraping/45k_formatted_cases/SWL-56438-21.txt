Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-56438-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


58 FOUNDRY ST LEAMINGTON ON N8H1C6


 




Between:


Yomna Atkins-Nuzum


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cindy Fox Trevor York


Tenants



 
 
Yomna
Atkins-Nuzum (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Cindy Fox and Trevor York (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This hearing was
held by videoconference on December 20, 2021.
The Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, Christopher Hall, attended the hearing. One Tenant, Trevor York, and the Tenant’s representative, Tori-Lee
Jenkins, also attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On August 10, 2021 the Landlord served the
Tenants with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12) with a termination date of
October 31, 2021. The N12 seeks
termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Landlord
requires the rental
unit for residential occupation.
 
2.    
The Landlord applied to
the Board to terminate this tenancy on September 9, 2021. The Landlord has, within two years prior
to filing this application, given another notice under section 48 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the “Act”)
in respect to the same rental unit. On November 18, 2020 the Landlord served the Tenants with an N12
seeking termination of the tenancy on the ground that the Landlord requires the
rental unit for residential occupation. The Landlord’s application to terminate
the tenancy, SWL-47300- 20, was dismissed during a Board hearing on August 9,
2021 because the Landlord paid the Tenants one month’s rent compensation after
the date of termination – not before it.
 
3.    
The current
N12 was served
to the Tenants in response
to the dismissed SWL-47300-20
application.
 
4.    
The Landlord’s representative submitted that this is a month to month tenancy with a
monthly rent of $900.50, and that the Tenants have no rent arrears.




 
Good faith
 
5.    
The N12 was served
pursuant to section 48 of the Act. Section 48(1) requires that, in order to be successful in this application, the Landlord must establish that at the time of the service of the N12 the Landlord
required, in good faith, the unit for residential use.
 
6.    
In Feeney v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), the Court held that the test of good faith is
genuine intention to occupy the premises and not the reasonableness of the
Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v. Beljinac 2001
CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), where
the Court held that the “good faith” requirement simply means that the Landlord
sincerely intends to occupy the rental unit. The Landlord may also have
additional motives for selecting a particular rental
unit, but this does not affect the good
faith of the Landlord’s notice.”
 
7.    
In the more recent case
of Fava v. Harrison, [2014] O.J No. 2678 ONSC 3352 (Ont.Div.Ct.) the
Court determined that while the motives of the Landlord are, per Salter, “largely irrelevant”, the Board can consider the
conduct and motives of the Landlord to draw inferences as to whether
the Landlord desires,
in good faith to occupy the property.
 
8.    
The Landlord testified
that she will be moving into the unit at 58 Foundry Street in Leamington for her own use
for a period of at least one year. Pursuant
to s. 71.1 of the Act, the Landlord provided a signed
affidavit, dated November 18, 2020 declaring her intent to reside in the rental
unit, in good faith, for a period of at least one year.
9.    
The Landlord testified
further that she currently lives in Windsor, but her parents, sisters and brothers
all live in Leamington, and that she would like to move to Leamington to live closer to
them. The Landlord stated that her
employer is in Windsor, but her work is completed on-line, and as a result, she
will be able to retain her position. She
noted that she will be moving into the rental unit with her three children.
10.  The Tenant testified
that he believes the Landlord’s application to evict him is not made in good faith. He explained that the rental unit is too small and poorly
maintained for the Landlord’s use – especially when compared with the
Landlord’s current residence in Windsor. Although
the Tenant questioned the Landlord’s motives for moving into the rental unit, he
did not provide any testimony or documentary evidence to challenge the
Landlord’s intent to reside in the rental unit for at least one year.
 
11.  On the basis of the evidence provided,
I am satisfied that the Landlord genuinely intends to use the rental unit for the residence of her family
for at least one year. I am also
satisfied that this second N12 to terminate this tenancy was served to the
Tenants to ensure they received
their one month’s
rent compensation before the date of termination rather than after it. I therefore find that the
Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation
for a period of at least one year.
 
Compensation
 
12.  Section 48.1 of the Act requires a landlord to compensate a tenant in an
amount equal to one month’s rent if the landlord, in good faith, requires
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. Section 55.1 of the Act requires this
compensation to be paid no




 
later than on the termination
date specified in the notice of
termination of the tenancy. In
addition, subsection 83(4) of the Act provides that no eviction order shall be
issued in a proceeding regarding a termination of a tenancy
for the purpose
of residential occupation unless the landlord has
complied with section 48.1 of the Act.
 
13.  The Landlord testified that cheque #83 in
the amount of $900.50 was provided to the Tenants in July 2021 as one month’s rent compensation for the first N12 that was served to the Tenants on November 18,
2020. The Landlord stated that this
cheque was retained by the Tenants, and considered by her as payment of the one
month’s rent compensation for the current N12 served to the Tenants on August
10, 2021. The Landlord testified
further that cheque #83 was never cashed, and was stale dated; therefore,
wanting to ensure that the Tenants received their compensation, she mailed
another cheque to the Tenants in the amount of $900.50.
 
14.  The Tenant testified that he received
cheque #83 for $900.50 from the Landlord in early August 2021; however, he never cashed it. He understood that this cheque
represented one month’s rent compensation for the Landlord’s first
application to terminate his tenancy. The
Tenant stated that after the Landlord’s first application was dismissed by the
Board on August 9, 2021, he destroyed the cheque by tearing it up. The Tenant testified further that he
received a second cheque from the Landlord in the amount of
$900.50 for one month’s
rent compensation on December 9, 2021.
 
15.  On the basis of the evidence provided,
I am satisfied that the Landlord met her obligation to pay the Tenants compensation
equal to one month’s rent in accordance with sections
48.1 and 55.1 of
the Act by providing cheque #83 to the Tenants in August 2021. I accept
that, without communication from the Tenants,
the Landlord believed
that cheque #83 had been retained
by the Tenants as one month’s rent compensation for the second N12. I am satisfied that when cheque #83 was considered stale dated,
the Landlord mailed another cheque to the Tenants to ensure that they received
their compensation.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
16.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
17.  The Tenant testified that he has been
looking for another rental unit for more than 18 months, but affordable
accommodation is scarce. His
financial circumstances are difficult. The Tenant stated that he has a disability from a leg injury that would complicate a potential move. The Tenant noted that his mother, who has
health issues, and his brother are also living with him.
 
18.  I find that, although the Landlord in good
faith requires possession of her rental unit for the residential occupation of
her family, postponing the Tenants’ eviction until February 28, 2022 will provide
the Tenants, who are struggling financially, with more time to secure
a rental unit that is suitable for them and their resident family members. I find that the short delay to the
Landlord in taking possession of the rental unit, as a result of this eviction
postponement, would not be unfair to the Landlord.
