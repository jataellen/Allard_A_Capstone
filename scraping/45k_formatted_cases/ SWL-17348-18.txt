Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-17348-18
 
CR
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SR
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.  The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date (the ‘L2 Application’).
 
These applications were heard in [CITY] on
July 5, 2018.  Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, DA, attended the hearing.  As of 10:05 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
May 22, 2018.
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $869.49, effective July 1,
2018.
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $854.57
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2018.
6.     The Tenant paid $1,240.00 after the application
was filed.
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The L2 Application 
8.     The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.  Specifically, the rental ledger submitted at the
hearing confirmed that since September, 2017, the Tenant has consistently
failed to pay the monthly rent in full and on or before the first day of the
month when it was due.  The Tenant’s payment history during this period
consists of partial payments and payments made well after the first of the
month.  As of the present hearing, the Tenant remained in arrears of rent.
9.     As a result, the Landlord’s application for
termination of the tenancy at the end of the term of the tenancy on the basis
of persistent late payment is allowed. 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, including the request of the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
11.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 17, 2018.
2.     As of the date of this order, the amount of the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,369.28*.
3.     However, the Landlord is authorized to offset
the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$28.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 7, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the
other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before July 17,
2018, then starting July 18, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 18, 2018.
7.     If, on or before July 17, 2018, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,073.61** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and
on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after July 18, 2018, but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
The L2 Application 
9.     If the Tenant voids the order for eviction under
the L1 Application pursuant to paragraph 7 of this order, then the following
shall apply:
a.    The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
 
i.      The Tenant shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first
day of each month, commencing August 1, 2018 and for twelve months thereafter
up to July 31, 2019.  
 
b.    If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in
paragraph 9ai above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of
a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 9ai of this order.
