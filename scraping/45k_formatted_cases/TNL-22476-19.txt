Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-22476-19
 










 
 
 

MC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SM,
AKA SB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 3, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, SK, and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from August 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 8, 2019.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenant’s
rent arrears for the period ending March 31, 2020.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $94.72 from the Tenant and this deposit is
still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 1, 2019
to November 8, 2019.
 
5.      The
Tenant paid $2,617.47 after the application was filed.
 
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.  
 
7.      At
the hearing, the Tenant testified that she began to accrue rent arrears because
of other expenses.  The Tenant’s evidence on those expenses, and why she
elected to pay those expenses before paying rent to the Landlord, was vague. 
The Tenant only explained that she experienced a “bump” in her monthly costs,
without further detail.
 
8.      The
Tenant, however, also testified that the expenses that contributed to her rent
arrears have been paid.  
 
9.      The
Tenant gave evidence that her monthly household income is approximately
$2,900.00.  The Tenant also receives a rent supplement to help pay the rent.
 
10.   The
Tenant’s evidence shows that the rental unit is affordable.  Although the
Tenant was not forthcoming in terms of explaining the “bump” in her household
costs, I find that evidence of her income and normal monthly expenses is credible.  

 
11.   The
Tenant requested relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan.  The
Tenant testified that she is able to pay $600.00 a month toward her arrears,
beginning on March 16, 2020.
 
12.   Although
the Landlord’s representative opposed relief from eviction, I note that the Act
is remedial legislation.  
 
13.   This
present application is the first application the Landlord has made to evict the
Tenant, since the tenancy began approximately three or four years ago.  Based
on the length of the tenancy and evidence of the Tenant’s ability to pay, I
conclude that it is not unfair under the circumstances to issue a conditional
order.
 
14.   In
arriving at this decision, I am mindful of the Landlord’s representative’s able
submission that issuing a conditional order may impose additional legal and
administrative duties on the Landlord.  The Act, however, certainly permits the
Board to issue conditional orders where the Board considers it appropriate to
do so.
 
15.   I
am also mindful of the current length of time it takes for the Board to hear
and determine a matter, including a set aside motion under section 78 of the
Act.  This is a matter for the Board to address and is exogenous to the issues
raised during the proceedings.  As such, I conclude that denying the Tenant
relief from eviction because of matters beyond either party’s control would not
be appropriate in this case.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,150.03* as follows:
 
a.    $600.00
on March 16, 2020;
b.    $600.00
on April 16, 2020;
c.    $600.00
on May 16, 2020;
d.    $600.00
on June 16, 2020;
e.    $600.00
on July 16, 2020; and
f.     $150.03
on August 16, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord rent for the period April 1, 2020 to
August 1, 2020, no later than the first day of each month.
 
3.      If
the Tenant fails to make a payment under paragraph one, above, the Landlord may
collect the entire outstanding balance from the amount set out in paragraph
one, immediately.
 
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any of the payments under paragraphs one or two, above,
the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, within 30 days of the
breach, without notice to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant; and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears and NSF
fees and related charges that become owing after March 3, 2020.
