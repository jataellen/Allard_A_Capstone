Starlight Canadian Residential
Growth Fund (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Upton Richard Excell (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022.   The Landlord's Legal Representative, Sean Beard, and the
Tenant’s wife, Kimeshia Excell, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not
paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
29, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,385.91
as of January 1, 2022
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid all arrears
for the period
ending January 31, 2022 after the application was
filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: TNL-35041-21

Landlord the full amount owing* on or before July 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from August 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
