            Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-10206-18



 


 


 



 
GJ (Deceased) (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict (AR1) and (AR2) (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on December 11,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s daughter, CJ and
the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord’s application was amended to show the
correct name of the first named Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 5,
2018 to January 4, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective November 3, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $2,000.00.
3.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe the Landlord the total of 6,190.00, which represents the
arrears of rent up to January 4, 2019, and the Landlord’s application filing
fee.
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $2,000.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 6, 2014 to November 3,
2018.
6.     
The Tenants have been living
in the unit for four years. The Tenant, AR1 receives a monthly pension of
approximately $1,600.00. AR2 does not have any income. The Tenants’ son, lives
in the unit and contributes $500.00 per month toward the rent. The Tenants say
that they were renting out the basement, but were not paid for a couple of
months and the individuals have now moved out. 
7.     
The Tenants also indicated
that they paid other expenses such has hydro, gas and other household expenses
and did not have any funds to pay the rent. Also, they had to pay a significant
amount towards arrears of rent in August 2018 when they fell into arrears.
8.     
The Tenants requested relief
and proposed a payment plan that would have the arrears paid in full by January
31, 2019. 
9.     
The Landlord requested a
standard order and opposed any relief. The Landlord submitted that for over a year,
the Tenants have not paid the rent, or have paid late. The parties have been
before the Board a few times on this tenancy and the Landlord had previously
filed with the Sheriff but the order was voided. In the past, the Tenants have
promised to pay and have not done so. The Landlord requires the rent payment so
she can make mortgage payments. 
10.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I say this
because even though the Tenants’ payment plan is not lengthy, the Landlord
should not have to wait for the arrears to be paid, considering that the
Tenants had funds available and did not pay any amount towards the rent in over
four months. The Tenants are in substantial arrears and chose to pay other
expenses before paying the rent or even a token about towards the rent. I also
considered that the Tenants’ monthly income is $2,100.00 and the rent is
$2,000.00. The parties have been before the Board a few times during this year
for arrears of rent. I am of the view that the Tenants do not currently have
the means to sustain this tenancy. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before December
23, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $2,398.84*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting December 13, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 23, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
December 24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 23, 2018, then starting December 24, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 24, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before December
23, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $6,190.00** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenants are no longer entitled to make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if the Tenants pay the amount required under that subsection on or after December
24, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord and the Tenants have already done so,
pursuant to Order TNL-06360-18-VO, issued on September 25, 2018.
