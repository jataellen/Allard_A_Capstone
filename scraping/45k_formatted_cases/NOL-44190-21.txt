Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44190-21
 



In the
  matter of:


UPPER, 172 CATHCART STREET SAULT STE MARIE ON P6A1E4


 




Between:


1972628 Ontario Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dawn Leonard
  Jody Leonard


Tenants



 
1972628 Ontario Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dawn Leonard
and Jody Leonard
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord, Michael Butler, attended the hearing.
As of 1:46 p.m., the Tenants were not present
or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 9, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $875.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenants, and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 8, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $16,493.47*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$28.77 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 29, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 8, 2022, then starting
February 9, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 9, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$16,986.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)         
$17,861.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 8, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 9, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
