Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-18791-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


609, 250
BRENYON WAY TORONTO ON
  M1B3G3


 




Between:


Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lydia Nembhard


Tenant



 
 
 
Brenyon Way Charitable Foundation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Lydia
Nembhard (the 'Tenant') because she, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone she permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
she, another occupant of the rental unit or someone she permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard
on February 1, 2022. The Landlord’s representative David Ciobotaru, and
the Tenant, represented by Lititia Webley, attended the hearing.
 
Preliminary
Matters:
 
During the initial stages of this
hearing, the facts as they were being presented became increasingly familiar. The parties were asked if this matter
related to a hearing I presided over earlier.
It was acknowledged that I had heard the Tenant’s
application TET-15861-21 on May 20, 2021.
 
The hearing on May 20, 2021 was
lengthy hearing with extensive testimony from multiple witnesses and engineer reports.
As a result, I informed
the parties that I am familiar with the facts of the case and the evidence that
led to the order issued on June 18, 2021. That
order was not reviewed nor appealed and as such the findings and determinations
stand.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on my knowledge of the facts leading up to the damage caused from excessive humidity in the Tenant’s rental
unit created by the Tenant’s lifestyle, I find the Tenant wilfully or
negligently caused damage to the rental unit.




 
 
 
2.     Based on the evidence which had been reviewed and the
previous hearing and the submissions from both parties at this hearing,
I find the Landlord has incurred costs of
$23,730.00 to repair the rental unit and replace
what could not be replaced.
 
3.     Based on the Tenant’s financial ability to pay for the
damage, the Landlord was asked for a submission on what may be an acceptable amount
to order for this claim. The Landlord requested that the Board order
the Tenant top pay 50% of the actual cost the Landlord incurred.
 
4.     The Tenant’s representative made the submission that the Tenant
cannot afford to pay
the reduced amount requested by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Based on the finding that the
Tenant’s wilfully or negligently caused the damage and the evidence the Landlord has incurred this cost, I find the reduced amount the Landlord
has requested to be reasonable in all the circumstances.
 
6.     The Landlord has also
requested that the tenancy be terminated. Considering the fact the Tenant has resided in the rental
unit for 30 years, I find that it would
not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,865.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 20, 2022, she will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 21, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
