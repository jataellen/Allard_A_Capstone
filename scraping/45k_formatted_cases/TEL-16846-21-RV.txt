Review Order
 
Global Properties Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Joy Rollox (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved by order TEL-16846-21 issued on August 25, 2021. On September 24, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order.
On October
1, 2021, interim
order TEL-16846-21-RV-IN was issued.
 
The review hearing
was held by videoconference on December 20, 2021.
The Landlord, Nathan Chang and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
stated he did not receive
the Notice of Hearing. I find the Landlord did not
have an adequate opportunity to participate in the hearing held on July 21,
2022. The review is granted.
 
2.    
The Landlord
requested the consent
of the Board to withdraw the L1 application because the N4 Notice is void.
 
3.    
In accordance with subsection 200(4)
of the Act, I consent
to the withdrawal of the application.
 
It is ordered that:
