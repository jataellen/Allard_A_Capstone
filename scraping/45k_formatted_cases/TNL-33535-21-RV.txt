Review Order
 
 
Jasbir Grewal (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Abas Ali (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was resolved
by order TNL-33535-21 issued on October
25, 2021.
 
On November 3, 2021, the Landlord
requested a review of the order alleging he was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing because
he did not receive the Notice of Hearing.
 
On November 8, 2021, the Board issued interim
order TNL-33535-21-RV-IN staying
the order issued on October
25, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s request was heard
by way of video conference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord, the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Atta
Choudhry, and the Tenant attended the hearing.
The Tenant spoke to Tenant
Duty Counsel prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s Request to Review
 
1.       
For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord was not reasonably able to
participate in the hearing held by the Board on October 14, 2021.
 
2.       
The Landlord’s Representative submitted that after filing the Landlord’s L2 application he checked every week on the Board’s
website for the date of hearing. On October 14,




 
2021, the Board’s website
indicated that no hearing was scheduled. A copy of the screen shot of the Board’s website on this
date was entered in evidence and was also attached the Landlord’s request to
review. Further, the Landlord’s
Representative submitted that neither he nor the Landlord received a copy of
the Notice of Hearing.
 
3.       
The Tenant stated that it is his position
that the Landlord
must have received
the Notice of Hearing. The
Tenant had no evidence to support his position.
 
4.       
Based on the evidence presented by
the Landlord’s Representative and the fact the Tenant did not have any evidence
to reasonably challenge
the Landlord’s position,
I am satisfied that the
Landlord was not reasonably able to participate in the Board hearing held on
October 14, 2021.
 
5.       
The Landlord’s request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing of the Landlord’s L2 Application
 
6.       
On May 28, 2021, the Landlord
served the Tenant with an N12 Notice of Termination (N12 notice). The N12 notice contains
a termination date of July 31, 2021. The basis of
the N12 notice is that the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for
his own personal use.
 
7.       
In support of his application, the Landlord filed with the Board a signed declaration stating that he in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for residential occupation. The declaration states that the Landlord
requires the rental unit for a period of one year or more.
 
8.       
The Landlord also provided a copy of the bank draft paid to the Tenant on July 20, 2021. The bank draft was in the amount equivalent
to one month’s rent. The Tenant confirmed receipt of the bank draft but noted
he could not deposit the money because the Landlord made an error in his last
name. The Landlord’s Representative
submitted that the name on the bank draft is the name for which the Tenant is known to the Landlord.
The Tenant did not provide any evidence to support his position that it
is the incorrect last name on the bank draft.
 
9.       
The Landlord testified
that he requires possession of the rental unit because
his previous living arrangements fell apart. He was living
with his parents
and then a friend. Because the Tenant did not vacate the rental unit by the termination
date set out in the N12 notice, the Landlord has been living
in a hotel. The Landlord
testified that he has no where to go
and needs possession of the rental unit for his own residential occupation.
 
10.    The Tenant testified that he has been living in the
rental unit since 2016. He does not
want to move out. He does not believe
the Landlord wants to move into
the rental unit. It is the Tenant’s position that the
Landlord wants to re-rent the unit for more money. The Tenant testified that he believes the Landlord wants to
re-rent the unit for more money because on two different occasions, someone
knocked on his door asking if he was moving out of the rental unit. The Tenant
had no evidence to support this allegation.




 
11.   
The Tenant testified that if he had to move out of the rental unit, he would
need at least 8 months
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Tenant testified that the pandemic has caused many delays and
finding new housing may be difficult.
 
Findings
 
12.   
The onus is on the Landlord
to establish that he in good faith requires the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
 
13.    In the leading
case law involving the landlord’s own use application, Salter v. Belijnac,
2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC), [2001], O.J. No. 2792 (Div. Ct.), the Divisional Court held that:
 
…the test of good faith is genuine
intention to occupy the premises
and not the reasonableness of the landlord’s proposal.
 
14.    Thus, the Landlord
must establish that he genuinely
intends to move into the rental unit. The Court also found in Salter that
the landlord’s motives are “largely irrelevant”.
 
15.    The Landlord provided clear and consistent evidence
that he intends to move into the rental unit for at
least one year. He wants to move into the rental
unit because he has no place to live and is currently staying
in a hotel room.
 
16.    The Tenant did not provide
evidence that reasonably challenged the Landlord’s evidence that he genuinely wants to move into the rental unit
for a period of at least one year. I
have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of Landlord’s testimony or his good
faith intentions. I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that
the Landlord, in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation for a minimum of one year.
 
17.   
With respect to the Tenant’s name
on the bank draft, I am satisfied that the Landlord made the bank draft payable
to the name of the Tenant which is know to him. If this name is in fact incorrect, and the Tenant
provides evidence to the Landlord
of the correct spelling of his last name, the Landlord can correct the
error to ensure the Tenant can deposit the compensation.
 
Section 83 Considerations
 
18.   
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
In making this finding, I considered the evidence of both parties. In doing so,
I am satisfied that this is a situation where the prejudice to the Landlord
outweighs that of to the Tenant. I
say this because the Landlord who owns a residence, and in good faith provided
the Tenant with a Notice of Termination, has been living in a hotel and
incurring unnecessary expenses. The
Landlord is the property owner and as such, has the
right to occupy his property
given my finding that he has
a genuine intention to do so. Further,
the Tenant has had since May 28, 2021 to find new housing. It is my opinion
that the Tenant has had more than an adequate amount of time to find a new
place to live.
