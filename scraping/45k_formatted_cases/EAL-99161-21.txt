Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99161-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1703, 1140 FISHER
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K1Z8M5


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie Hay


Tenant



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Stephanie Hay (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
October 13, 2021 with respect to application EAL-97584-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $661.00 arrears
on or before November 30, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $1,751.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
EAL-97584-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $656.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-97584-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,566.49 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-97584-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
As of the date of this
order, the Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears of rent, that the Landlord is entitled to under this
order by $46.98.
 
4.    
The Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant: $50.79
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 18, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
5.    
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
The Landlord
or the Tenant shall pay any amounts that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022                                                                               Date Issued                                                                       Jim McMaster

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 29, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
