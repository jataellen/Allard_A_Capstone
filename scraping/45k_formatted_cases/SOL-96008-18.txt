Order under Section 126
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
 
 
 
 
SH (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order permitting the rent charged to be increased by more than the guideline for one or more of the rental units in the residential complex because of municipal taxes and charges and capital
expenditures.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.                 
On August 15, 2020, the Board
issued a Notice
of Hearing by e-mail
to the Landlord.
 
2.                 
On December 14, 2020, the Board issued a Deficiency Letter to the Landlord to file the Certificate
of Service, setting out how and when the Tenants of the residential complex
were given a copy of the application and notice of hearing. The Landlord was required to respond by
December 29, 2020.
 
3.                 
As the Landlord has failed to respond to the Deficiency Letter, the Board cannot consider
the application.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.




2.                 
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that
is owed as a result
of this order within 60 days
of the order issuance date.
