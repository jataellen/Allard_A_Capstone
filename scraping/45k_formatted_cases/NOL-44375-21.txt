Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44375-21
 



In the
  matter of:


1, 80 PINE STREET CHAPLEAU ON P0M1K0


 




Between:


Manitoulin-Sudbury DSB


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Nathalie Parent
  Remi Servant


Tenants



 
Manitoulin-Sudbury DSB (the
'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict Remi Servant and Nathalie
Parent (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, Kristian Thorne,
and the Tenant,
Nathalie Parent on behalf of both Tenants,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2019 to February 28,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 2, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent is $1,355.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $2,640.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 31, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $6,251.10*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 11, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$44.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$7,276.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$8,631.00 if the payment is made on or before
March 31, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after
April 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
