Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-01527-18



 


 


 



 
BGL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict PB, and TB (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on April 26, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s property manager, (AM), and the
Landlord’s representative, GP attended the hearing. The Tenant, (TB) attended
the hearing on behalf of the Tenants and was self-represented. 
 
The Landlord’s application was amended to remove
the name of TB’s minor child. The application was amended to indicate there are
two Tenants.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 

The Landlord raised the issue that the Tenants failed to comply
     with the Board’s interim order issued on March 1, 2018 that the Tenants
     pay the rent to the Board in trust. The Tenants paid the rent for March
     2018 in the amount of $1,300.00 into the Board in trust. However the
     Tenants did not pay the rent for April 1, 2018 into the Board. The
     Landlord submitted that the Tenants should not be permitted to raise
     issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
     (the ‘Act’) due to the breach of the interim order.
The Tenant TB says that they breached the interim order because
     their issues have not been met and the place is getting worse. I take this
     to mean that the Tenants have maintenance issues with the Landlord. 
Subsection 195(4) of the Acts says: “If a respondent is
     required to pay a specified sum into the Board within a specified time under
     clause (1) (a) and fails to do so, the Board may refuse to consider the
     evidence and submissions of the respondent.” This is the only power
     available to the Board to deal with situations like this where an interim
     order is breached. 
After considering the submissions of the parties at the
     hearing, I am of the view that the Tenants did not provide a rational
     reason or excuse for failing to obey the interim order. The interim order
     was clear that the Tenants pay the rent to the Board. The interim order was
     not conditional on the Landlord having to take any action or complete any
     tasks. Board orders are not mere suggestions, they are legally binding
     orders, and if the Board does not uphold and enforce its own orders
     disrespect for the Board’s processes will undoubtedly follow. As a result,
     I am of the view that this is an appropriate instance to refuse to
     consider the Tenants’ evidence and submissions with respect to their
     section 82 claims. As I stated at the hearing, the Tenants are free to
     file their own application.  
I proceeded to hear only the Landlord’s L1 application.

Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1,
2017 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice
of Termination effective December 26, 2017.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing
is $1,300.00. 
3.     
The Tenants have paid
$1,300.00 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **
4.     
There is a dispute whether
the Tenants paid the rent for October to December 2017.
5.     
The Tenant TB testified that the Tenants paid
the rent for October to December 2017. TB says that the rent is always paid by
cash and she has no receipts for the rent payments. TB initially testified that
at the end of November she paid the rent for October by giving the cash to the
young guy that the Landlord sends to collect the rent. She says she asked for a
receipt and was told to contact AM. She says that she sent AM an email
requesting the receipt but did not have a copy of the email. TB says that she
did not have data on her cell phone so she could not access her email during
the hearing. 
6.     
TB testified that at the end of September she
paid November’s rent. When I questioned why she is paying November’s rent
before October’s, TB explained that she pays at the end of the month because
that is when she receives funds from Ontario Works (OW). TB then clarified her
testimony that it was at the end of September she paid October’s rent and gave
the cash payment to a young guy with glasses that came to collect the rent but
she did not ask for a receipt. TB says that at the end of October when she paid
the rent for November she asked for a receipt. 
7.     
TB testified that during the first week of
December, AM came to collect the rent and she gave him the rent in cash and
asked for a receipt. According to TB, AM told her that he would email her a
receipt. 
8.     
It was the evidence of the Landlord’s property
manager, AM that the Tenants have not paid the rent for October to December
2017. AM denied that he collected the rent from TB during December. AM
confirmed that he sends staff to collect the rent and no payments were received
from the Tenants.
9.     
There was evidence before me of a text message
the Landlord sent to the Tenant TB on November 14, 2017, saying someone will
come by to pick up the money and fix the door. On November 21, 2017, TB sent a
text to the Landlord as follows: 
You
came to my house being very unprofessional, swearing at me and doing it in
front of my child and my niece. Please don’t call or text back my phone. Thank
you.
I
don’t know how you’re going to get the rent but u should’ve thought about that
before being so disrespectful. Bye.
10.   TB testified that the Tenants stopped paying the rent in January
2018 due to their maintenance issues with the Landlord. As such, I find that
the Tenants have withheld the rent for January 2018 to April 2018.
11.   Based on the evidence before me I find it more likely than not that
the Tenants have not paid the rent for October to December 2017. The Tenants
did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that they paid the rent for
this period of time. The Tenants knew that they would be disputing whether the
rent was paid yet, did not bring any documentary evidence to support their
position. TB could have brought the email she allegedly sent to AM asking for a
receipt for October’s rent. Also, I would have expected that the Tenants after
receiving the Form N4 and the L1 application would have contacted the Landlord
to inquire as to why the Landlord was claiming outstanding rent for October to
December, when it was allegedly paid. There was no evidence from TB that she
contacted the Landlord about this discrepancy on the Form N4 and L1.
Furthermore, I find that TB’s text message in November 2017 is telling,
wherein, TB acknowledges that rent is owed. TB’s own text message contradicts
her testimony that the rent was paid.
12.   TB receives monthly benefits from OW in the amount of $1,200.00. She
also earns an additional monthly income of $400.00 as a hair stylist. Tenant PB
is employed as a day care teacher and has a monthly income of $3,000.00. The
Tenants have a total monthly income of $4,600.00.
13.   The Tenants indicated that they had most of the funds for January to
April rent (which was being withheld) and proposed to pay $500.00 on the 15th
of each month until the arrears of $3,900.00 are paid in full.
14.   The Landlord opposed the payment plan and submitted that the
Tenants’ combined income could have the arrears paid sooner than over seven
months.
15.   I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance
with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. I considered that this is not a lengthy tenancy
(1 ½ years) and the Tenants have been withholding the rent. What this means is
that the Tenants should have the funds to pay the arrears and void the order.
In my view, it would be unfair to grant the Tenants’ payment plan when they
have not paid the rent in over seven months, even when they had the funds to do
so. The Landlord should not have to wait for over seven months for the arrears
to be paid in full. I also considered that the Tenants breached the interim
order to pay the rent to the Board. 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 13,
2018.The amount of $1,300.00 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,839.21*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 2, 2018.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting May 3, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 13, 2018, the Tenants will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from May 14,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before May 13, 2018, then starting May 14, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 14, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before May 13,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $9,290.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after May 14, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
10.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $1,300.00 together with any accrued interest. **
