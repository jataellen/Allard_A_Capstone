Tenants




 
On November
10, 2021, Suites Of Somerset/Manor Park Mgmt Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Stefanie McRae and Kathy Williams (the 'Tenants') and for an order to
have the Tenants pay compensation for damage they owe because the Tenants
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August
24, 2021 with respect to application EAL-96293-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$150.00 on or before
November 1, 2021 towards damages.
 
3.     
The previous
application included a request for an order for compensation for damage caused by the Tenant
and the resulting order required the Tenant to pay an amount for damage. Accordingly, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for compensation for damage. The previous application did not included
arrears of rent.
 
4.     
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $1,278.75 for compensation for damage and the costs related to
the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-96293-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $897.25 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-96293-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,395.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 1, 2021 to
January 5, 2022.




File Number: EAL-98954-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Order EAL-96293-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 16, 2022.
 
3.     
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $897.25. This amount represents the unpaid compensation for damage and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $45.86
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 6, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 17, 2022 at2 .00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.
