Review Order
 
Gk Associates
& Construction Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Ron Dempsey and Kathleen Tempelaar (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order TSL-22803-21 issued on November
16, 2021.
 
On January 4,
2022, the Tenants requested a review of the order and that the order be stayed
until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On January 4,
2022, interim order TSL-22803-21 -IN was issued, staying the order issued on
November 16, 2021. The Tenants alleged that they were not reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding.
 
The request
was heard by video conference on January 25, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent, S.
Kuzmanovic (SK), the Landlord's Legal Representatives, L. Barder and K. Aguiar,
and the Tenants’ Legal Representative, J. Wallace attended the hearing. The
Tenants were absent from the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants
alleged that they were not reasonably able to participate in the original
proceedings of November 3, 2021, which resulted in order TSL-22803-21
terminating the tenancy.
2.    
In support of the
request to review the order, the Tenants stated that they did not receive the Notice of Hearing in the mail because their mail was redirected
by Canada Post. As




 
the new location
for mail pick up was an hour bus ride from the
rental unit, the Tenants who have a
young child, did not pick up their mails.
3.    
The Tenants
presented a letter from Canada Post, dated April 30, 2021, as evidence in
support of their assertion that their mail was redirected. The letter informed
the Tenants that due to a compromised mail system, there would be a temporary
change to mail delivery. The Tenants also provided pictures of damaged
mailboxes, but it was unclear on what
date the pictures were taken.
4.    
The Landlord’s
Agent, SK, testified that she took over the operations of the residential
complex with the assistance of a sibling following the passing of her father in
April 2021. They were initially unaware of the letter from Canada Post but when
it came to their attention in May 2021, the mailboxes were all repaired.
Analysis
5.    
The Landlord and
Tenant Board Interpretation Guideline 8 states that “The LTB will only
exercise its discretion to grant a review when it is satisfied the order
contains a serious error, a serious
error occurred in the proceeding or the requestor
was not reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding”.
6.    
Although the Notice of Hearing
states categorically that if you are the Tenant and you do not attend the
hearing or send a representative, the Board can hold the hearing without you
and make a decision based on what is claimed by the Landlord, the Board’s power to review a decision
may be exercised if a party to a proceeding was not reasonably able to
participate in the proceeding. The courts have enjoined that the phrase “not
reasonably able to participate” should be interpreted broadly to ensure natural
justice and, where a party shows that they genuinely intended to participate in
a hearing but were prevented from so doing, then they should be entitled to a
hearing through the review process.
 
7.    
However, in this
case I am not satisfied that the Tenants intended to participate in the
proceeding. While the Tenants claim that they were not able to attend the
hearing because they did not receive a Notice of Hearing due to the change to
mail delivery in April 2021, the Landlord asserts that the mailboxes were
repaired in May 2021, and by necessary implication, mail delivery was resumed
at the residential complex. I prefer the evidence of the Landlord as I find it
extremely unlikely that the mail delivery continued to be diverted from April
2021 to an undisclosed date, and the Tenants during this time did not once find
it prudent to pick up the mail.
8.    
The best evidence
before me is that of the Landlord and the record of the Board shows that the
Notice of Hearing was sent by mail to the Tenants on September 1, 2021 and is
therefore, deemed received by the Tenants on September 6, 2021 pursuant to
section 191 (3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 which states that
a notice or document given by mail shall be deemed to have been given on the
fifth day after mailing.
9.    
Based on the
submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that the Tenants were not
reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review order
TSL-22803-21 issued on November 16, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and
remains unchanged.
 
2.    
The interim order issued on
January 4, 2022 is cancelled. The stay of order TSL-22803- 21 is lifted
immediately.
