Joshua Douthwright Kelly-ann Rooyakkers


Tenants




 
 
Holborn Holdings Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Kelly-ann Rooyakkers and Joshua Douthwright (the 'Tenants') because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was scheduled by videoconference on October 4, 2021 at 9am.
Only the Landlord attended the hearing when the matter
was called at 10:12am.
We note the second-named Tenant joined the video conference line at 10:30am,
after the matter had been disposed of.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
By way of background, this is a month-to-month tenancy
and rent is due on the first of
every month in the amount of $1,066.88.
 
2.       
As of the hearing
date, the Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.       
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a N8 notice of termination served
to the Tenants on July 12,
2021 with a termination date of September 30, 2021 alleging persistent late
payment of rent between August 2020 and July 2021.
 
4.       
Since then, the Tenants
have made efforts
to pay the rent on time and, as of the hearing date, have a credit balance of
$13.12.
 
5.       
As such, the Landlord
seeks a conditional order requiring
the Tenants to pay their rent on time for the next twelve months.
 
6.       
The Landlord also seeks
reimbursement of the application filing
fee in the amount of
$186.00, after the credit
on the Tenants’ account is applied.




 
7.       
We find the Landlord’s request to benefit
the Tenants as it will provide
them with the opportunity to preserve their tenancy.
 
8.       
We have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject
to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
9.       
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
If the Tenants have not already
done so, the Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
the lawful monthly rent for November 2021 and December 2021 as follows:
 
a)    
The rent for November
2021 on or before January
20, 2022; and
 
b)    
The rent for December
2021 on or before February
20, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord the new rent as it comes due for the period between January
2022 through to December 2022 in full and
no later than the first day of each month.
 
3.       
If the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance
with this order the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$172.88 for the cost of filing the application on or before January 17, 2022.
 
5.       
If the Tenants fail to comply with paragraph 4 of this
order, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from January
18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
