Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97114-21
 



In the matter
of:


3513 HOLLEFORD RD HARTINGTON ON K0H1W0


 




Between:


Merlin Redmond


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Timms Courtney Durance


Tenants



 
 
Merlin Redmond (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amanda Timms and Courtney Durance (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 11, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Tracey Timmerman, attended the hearing. As of 11:10 a.m.,
the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Upon review of the Landlord’s notice to terminate for
non-payment of rent, the second row of the notice indicates
the rent period commences on January 1, 2021 and ends on June 1, 2021.
 
2.    
This incorrectly identifies the rental
period as both starting and ending on the first
day of a month. As the rental period has not been properly identified
the notice is invalid.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord's application is dismissed.
