Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98805-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 57 WOLFE STREET KINGSTON ON K7M1H4


 




Between:


Adam Kerr


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephen Hinton


Tenant



 
 
 
Adam Kerr (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Stephen Hinton (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the
Board on June 15, 2021 with respect to application EAL-92780-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order EAL-98805-21, issued on January 5,
2022. The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order EAL-98805-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 18, 2022. The Landlord's Legal
Representative, L. McCullough and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order EAL-92780-20 provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of the Act, alleging
that the Tenant
failed to pay the rent for the month
of November 2021, on the first day of the month. As a result, ex parte order EAL-98805-21 was
issued terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
Order EAL-92780-20 required the Tenant to pay portions
of the outstanding arrears of
$7,186.00 on a monthly
basis until completely paid off on September 15, 2023. The Tenant
was also ordered to pay the monthly rent on the first day of each month until
September 2023.
 
4.    
The parties agree that in September
2021, the Tenant
paid all the outstanding arrears
at a much earlier date than
stipulated in order EAL-92780-20.

5.     Based on all the evidence, the Tenant paid the Landlord
the full amount
owing for the period
ending September 30, 2021. The amount paid represented all the rent that
was in arrears under the tenancy agreement, all the additional rent that would
have been due under the tenancy agreement on the date of the Tenant’s payment,
and the filing fee for the application.
 
6.     The Landlord argued that the order also required the
Tenant to pay the monthly rent until September
2023 and since he failed to
pay November 2021 rent on the first, he breached order EAL-92780-20.
 
7.     However, as contained in paragraph 3 of the order, the
consequences of a breach were termination of the tenancy and payment of all
outstanding arrears. As the outstanding arrears were paid in September 2021,
before the alleged breach, and the Landlord’s original application was not based
on allegations of persistent late payment of rent, the Tenant satisfied the requirements of order EAL-92780-20.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside order EAL-98805-21, issued on
January 5, 2022, is granted. The order cannot be enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant has satisfied the conditions specified
in the order issued by the Board on June 15, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-92780-20.
