Between:                  Ian Shemesh Laura Walker


Tenants




 
 
and
 




Behzad Yousefirad Shohreh Saremi


Landlords




 
 
 
Ian Shemesh and Laura Walker (the
'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Shohreh Saremi and Behzad
Yousefirad (the 'Landlords') failed to meet the Landlords' maintenance
obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') or failed
to comply with health,
safety, housing or maintenance standards.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on October 14, 2021.
 
The Tenant, Ian Shamesh,
the Tenant's Legal Representative, Ashley Friel, and the Landlord Behzad Yousefirad, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application is brought pursuant
to subsection 20(1)
of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) which states:
 
A landlord is responsible for
providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with
health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.
 
2.     The Tenants take the position
that the Landlord
is in breach of subsection 20(1) of the Act
by failing to provide snow removal and lawn maintenance.
 
3.     The Landlords’ position is that the Tenants are
responsible for snow removal and lawn maintenance pursuant to the lease
agreement between the parties which states that the Tenants “agree to be
responsible for snow removal and lawn maintenance on the premises for the term of the lease.”
The Landlord also claims that the Tenants
did not ask him to provide snow removal or lawn maintenance.




 
 
 
4.    
Although the tenancy agreement
states that the Tenants are responsible to maintain the lawn, section 3 of the Act specifies that the Act applies despite
any agreement or waiver
to the contrary.
 
5.    
Consequently, by requiring a tenant to maintain the lawn
and remove the snow a landlord
is essentially transferring its responsibility to maintain a unit in a good
state of repair including compliance with housing and maintenance standards to
a tenant. This contravenes section 3 of the Act.
 
6.     In Montgomery v. Van, 2009 ONCA 808 (CanLII),
the Court of Appeal found that a landlord cannot fulfill its statutory duty by
requiring tenants to perform prescribed maintenance unless there is a severable contractual obligation. This means that if there
is an agreement that the tenant maintains the lawn, there must be
consideration given to the tenant
for this responsibility. In this case, there was no evidence of any
consideration provided to the Tenant for maintaining the lawn such as a rent
discount or other incentives.
 
7.    
I find that the Tenants did ask
the Landlords to provide snow removal and lawn maintenance. The Landlord
concedes that the Tenants informed him that this was the Landlords
responsibility. It does not make sense to me that the Tenants would bring up
this obligation with the Landlords without requesting that the Landlords fulfill
its obligation.
 
8.    
For the above reasons,
I find that the Landlords
failed to meet their obligations under subsection 20(1) of the Act.
 
9.     The Tenants provided invoices and receipts to prove
that they incurred out of pocket costs of $565 for snow removal,
$559.35 for lawn maintenance, and $118.65 for bags of salt. These expenses were incurred
because of the Landlords’ failure to maintain the rental unit. Based on similar cases and my
experience with the Board, I find
these costs to be reasonable. Therefore, the Tenants are entitled to these
costs.
 
10.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it and no further
reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords shall pay to the Tenants
$1,243.00 which is the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses the Tenants have incurred for snow
removal, lawn maintenance and bags of salt
 
2.     The Landlords shall also pay the Tenants
$48.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlords owe the Tenants
is $1,291.00.
 
4.     The Landlords shall pay the Tenants the full amount
owing by February
18, 2022.




 
5.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by February 18, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 19, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
 
6.    
The Tenants have the right, at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
