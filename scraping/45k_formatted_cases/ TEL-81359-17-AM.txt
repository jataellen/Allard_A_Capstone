Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act
 
 
File Number: TEL-81359-17-AM
 










 
 
 

F.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.G.
and T.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.  This
is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 7, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the second-named Tenant attended the hearing.
 
This amended order is issued to correct clerical errors in the
original order issued on July 18, 2017. 
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 7, 2017 to August 6, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 14, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 8,
2016 to June 14, 2017.
4.     The
Tenant initially requested a repayment plan of 7 months by paying an extra
$500.00 a month.  After the Landlord said he did not agree with that length of
time, the Tenant said she would be able to make 4 payments in order to clear up
the balance of arrears.  
5.     The
Landlord stated he is experiencing hardship because he cannot pay his mortgage
due to the lack of payment from the Tenants.
6.     The
Landlord receives $1,150.00 of the monthly rent paid directly to him by social
services.  The Landlord is not without any payment, but the Tenants portion and
one full month of rent.
7.     The
second-named Tenant further stated there are 9 people living in the rental
unit.  Three adults and 6 children ranging in age from 1 year old to 13 years
old.
8.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
L2
APPLICATION
9.     The
Landlord served the Tenants with a Notice of Termination for persistently
paying their rent late.  This notice was to have a termination date set out at
least 60 days from service and it must be the end of term.
10.  This
tenancy is a mid-month tenancy which begins on the 7th day of every
month and goes to the 6th day of the next month.  The Landlord
served the Tenants on May 30, 2017.  This means that the termination date
should have been at least 60 days after service and on the last day of the
term, which should be August 6, 2017.  The Landlord listed the termination date
as July 31, 2017, making this notice invalid.
11.  As a
result, the Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed; therefore no pay on
time order shall be issued beyond the last payment of arrears October 20, 2017.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,349.00 for arrears of rent
to August 6, 2017 and costs.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in
accordance with the following schedule:
a)    $824.75
on or before July 29, 2017;
b)    $824.75
on or before August 20, 2017;
c)    $824.75
on or before September 20, 2017; and
d)    $874.75
on or before October 20, 2017.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord the monthly rent on or before the 7th
day of every month beginning August 7, 2017 until October 7, 2017.
4.     If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenants to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after August 6, 2017.
