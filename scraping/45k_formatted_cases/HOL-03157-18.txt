P.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.M.G.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on September 19, 2018. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 19, 2018.
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 2, 2018 to
July 19, 2018.
4.      The
Tenant paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before October 1, 2018.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,003.48*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to September 20, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $42.74 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting September 21, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
October 1, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from October 2, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 1, 2018, then starting October 2,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 2,
2018.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $3,075.00 if the payment is made on or before September 30, 2018, or
ii)       $4,375.00 if the payment is made on or before October 1, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after October 2, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
