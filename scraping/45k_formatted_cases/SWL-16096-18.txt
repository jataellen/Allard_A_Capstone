Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-16096-18
 
HM
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict PC (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1)
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. (L2)
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on
June 27, 2018.
 
The Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenant attended the hearing and spoke with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
The Tenant initially
requested an adjournment in order to seek legal representation.  When I
enquired why she had not done that between the time she was served with the
application in April 2018, and the hearing date, she said that she had had a
lot going on. She acknowledged that she should have sought counsel sooner and
that she had consulted with Duty Counsel.  She then withdrew her request for an
adjournment because she said that she has been seeking alternate accommodation
and needs an eviction order so that her position on the central housing
registry will be moved up.  
 
The Tenant said that
the Landlord had taken her keys.  The Landlord testified that the Tenant had
lost her keys on multiple occasions and he had replaced them.  The Tenant’s
evidence was vague.  I found the Landlord’s testimony more persuasive on this
issue because he was more specific with respect to specific incidents when the
Tenant had lost her keys. 
 
Determinations:
Application to
Terminate a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant (L2)
 
1.     
The Landlord testified that
the tenant in the unit below the Tenant has repeatedly complained that the
Tenant makes too much noise late at night.  He said that he has heard the
Tenant’s loud music and her television and her singing when he has stopped by
late at night to pick up the rent. 
 
2.     
The Tenant has made
excessive noise. This conduct has substantially interfered with the other
tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex.
Application to Evict
a Tenant for Non-payment of Rent and to Collect the Rent the Tenant Owes (L1)
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to
June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 18, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $775.00.
 
4.      The Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
 
5.     
The Tenant paid $775.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
On consent of the
parties, it is ordered that:
                                          
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before August 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,290.00, which represents the rent and costs owing up to August 31,
2018.
3.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from September
1, 2018, at 3.00% annually on the outstanding balance.
4.     
The Landlord’s application
to evict the Tenants on an earlier date than August 31, 2018, is denied on the
condition that:
(a)  The Tenants shall make the following payments to the
Landlord in respect of the monies owing under paragraph 1 of this order:



Date Payment Due


Amount of Payment




July 15,108


$775.00
(arrears and costs)



 
(b)  The Tenants shall also pay the Landlord the rent
for the month of August 2018, n full, on or before the first day of the
corresponding month.
(c)  The Tenant shall not engage in any of the activity alleged in the Notice
to Terminate a Tenancy Early (N5) dated March 7, 2018.
5.      If the Tenants fail to make the payments in
accordance with paragraph 3 or
4, and by the dates required,
then:
(a)  The Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenants on an earlier date than August 31, 2018, and for the payment of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not
already ordered under paragraph 2 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 4 of this order. If the Landlord obtains an order under
section 78 of the Act, then the Landlord may choose which eviction order to
enforce. 
(b)  The balance owing under paragraph 2 of this
order shall become payable on the day following the date of default. The monies
owing shall bear interest at the post-judgment interest rate determined under
subsection 207(7) of the Act.
6.     
If the Tenant fails to comply with the condition
set out in paragraph 4(c) above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the
Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. 
The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a
condition set out in paragraph 1 of this order. 
7.     
Notwithstanding paragraphs 4
and 5 of this order, if the unit is not vacated on or before August 31, 2018, then
starting September 1, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after September 1, 2018.
