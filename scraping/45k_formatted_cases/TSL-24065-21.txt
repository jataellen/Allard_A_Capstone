Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24065-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


215, 240 LAKE
PROMENADE TORONTO ON M8W1B2


 




Between:


Lake Promenade Apartments Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Geoff McGrath Steven McGrath


Tenants



 
 
 
Lake Promenade Apartments Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Geoff McGrath and Steven McGrath
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative,
Howard Levenson, and the Tenant, Steven McGrath, attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty Counsel prior
to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 3, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is
$1,750.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
The Tenant testified
that he did not dispute the amount of rent owed and was seeking a payment plan
in order to pay the balance owed.
 
7.    
The Landlord’s Legal Representative submitted into evidence two letters dated respectively
on September 14, 2021 and October 5, 2021 offering
the Tenant the opportunity to discuss
a reasonable payment plan. The Tenant did not respond
to either of the Landlord’s letters.




 
8.    
The Landlord is seeking
a standard 11-day order for termination of the tenancy due to the
arrears of rent.
 
9.    
The Tenant testified that he
was not able to the pay the rent because
of Covid 19 and that his
then girlfriend had moved in and was responsible to put some money towards
the rent. He further testified
that the relationship broke down and effects of the break-up put him in a state of depression. The Tenant did not submit
any medical evidence
to support his claim
that he suffers with mental health issues.
 
10.  The Tenant testified that he is not
employed but is hoping to work with his father. The Tenant’s current income was
not clear, but he stated that he had an appointment booked with Ontario Works
to discuss the possibility of collecting a benefit. The Tenant then testified that he expects to be making about
$3,400.00 per month and he stated that he could pay the rent and an additional
$250.00 per month towards the arrears. Such a payment plan would result in the
Landlord not receiving the arrears for 35 months. The Tenant further testified that he cannot afford any more that
$250.00 per month.
 
11.  The Landlord’s Legal Representative argued
that a 35-month payment plan is prejudicial to the Landlord and the Tenant has
made no attempts to negotiate anything until the day of the hearing.
 
12.  I am not satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant can pay the rent and pay the arrears
as his income was purely speculative
and therefore the tenancy is not a viable
one. The arrears of rent are substantial, and the Tenant has not paid the
monthly rent for five months. The Tenant’s proposed payment plan of $250.00 per
month is unreasonable and prejudicial to the Landlord as it would take 35
months to clear the balance owing.
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not
be unfair to postpone the termination of the tenancy to January 31, 2022,
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $7,824.09*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 14, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $57.53 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 15, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,686.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
