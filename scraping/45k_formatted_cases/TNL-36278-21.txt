Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36278-21
In the matter of:      401, 795 DAVIS DRIVE
NEWMARKET ON L3Y2R6
 
Between:                  795 Davis Drive                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Jason Brammer                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
On November 23, 2021, 795 Davis
Drive (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason
Brammer (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
November 23, 2021 with respect to application TNL-34286-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant
if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$250.00 on or before November
15, 2021 towards arrears of
rent. The Tenant only paid $100.00.
This was a breach of the prior consent order.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $1,276.89 for rent arrears in Order TNL-34286-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $926.89 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
TNL-34286-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from December 31, 2020
to January 17, 2022.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
Order TNL-34286-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 28, 2022 (standard 11
days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
3.       
As of the date of this order, the
Tenant owes no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the amount, that the Landlord is entitled to under this order by
$73.67*.
 
4.       
The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$35 86 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1,
2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.       
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay any amounts that become owing as a result of this
order.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
