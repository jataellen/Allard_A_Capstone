Tenant



 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Philip
Kipchumba Samoei (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on December 13, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of 1:33 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 13, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
November 30, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the
date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,045.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $2,045.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September
15, 2020 to September 13, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $4,000.00 after
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,258.93*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
