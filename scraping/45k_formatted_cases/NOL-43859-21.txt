Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43859-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


212, 70 MARSHALL AVENUE
E NORTH BAY ON P1A1R1


 




Between:


Holyname Community Non-profit Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Roberta Hookimawilli


Tenant



 
 
Holyname Community Non-profit
Housing (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Roberta
Hookimawilli (the 'Tenant')
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 13, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Representative C. Deroscher attended
the hearing. Determinations:
1.    The Landlord served the Tenant with a Form N5 alleging
the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
 
2.    The Landlord relies upon a Form N5, which contains a
termination date of September 7, 2021. The
Landlord did not file a certificate of service for its Form N5, but the
Landlord’s Representative advised that it was served on August 23, 2021.
 
3.   
Subsection 43(2)
of the Act provides that a notice of termination must set out the reasons and
details respecting the termination. Further,
section 64(2)(a) requires that a first Form N5 provide for a termination date
not earlier than the 20th day after the notice is served.
 
4.    The Landlord failed to identify in its Form N5 whether
it is a first Form N5 capable of being voided, or whether it is a second Form
N5 which cannot be voided. The
distinction is particularly important in this case as there are different
notice requirements between a first N5 and a second Form N5. Only 15 days notice was provided in this
case between the date of service and the termination date., I find that this is
contrary to section 64(2)(a) of the
Act, and that the Landlord’s application must fail as a result.




File Number: NOL-43859-21
 
5.    I will also note that while the Landlord did file a
Form N5 with a termination date of September 3, 2021, this document was not
signed, nor did it contain any signature information on page 2 of the form, contrary
to section 43(1) of the Act which requires a notice to be signed by the person
giving the notice, or the person’s agent. I
find this document to be an invalid Form N5.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
