STREET W LONDON ON N5W0A6


 




Between:

Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Jose Fernando Noubleau Castaneda Presley Showers


 
Tenants



 
 
 
Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Presley Showers and Jose Fernando Noubleau
Castaneda (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, John Edlund,
attended the hearing.
As of 2:34 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,112.07.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $4,446.21 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
sent a letter to the Tenants on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The
Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,110.91 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2020 to December
31, 2020.




 
8.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until January 31, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. Additional time given to
the Tenants to pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$230.60*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 6,
2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $36.56 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,416.35** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
