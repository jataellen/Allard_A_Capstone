Between:


Alexandra Stavrou


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Abby Birtch Isabella Birtch
Kathryn Mcfadden-Birtch
  Michael Birtch
William
Birtch


Tenants



 
 
 
Alexandra Stavrou
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Isabella Birtch, Michael Birtch, William
Birtch, Kathryn Mcfadden-Birtch and Abby Birtch (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenants because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage;
and because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential
complex have wilfully caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021. Only the Landlord and the
Landlord’s legal representative, T. Schoenleber, attended
the hearing. As of 1:29 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective October 5, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.




 
 
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,050.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.    
Pursuant to section 83(6) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), I am required to consider whether
the Landlord made attempts to negotiate a payment agreement with the Tenants.
The Landlord submitted into evidence a payment plan emailed and hand- delivered
to the Tenants on November 28, 2021. The Landlord did not receive any response
from the Tenants. I am satisfied that
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a payment agreement with the Tenants.
 
L2 Application:
 
 
7.    
The Landlord also
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the
residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord served an N5 notice
on the Tenants on September 20, 2021 and an N7 notice on October 31, 2021.
 
8.    
By way of background,
the unit is a semi-detached single-family dwelling. The Tenants have resided in
the unit for four years. The Landlord installed new carpet, new tiles,
backsplash and the unit was clean prior to the Tenants’ occupancy.
 
9.    
The N5 notice was
regarding an inspection of the unit on August 29, 2021. The tenants located in unit 502 notified the Landlord that water was entering their unit from the Tenants’ unit. When the Landlord attended,
they found substantial sewage in the basement of the Tenants’ unit, approximately a foot high. When the Landlord attended
with the plumber,
he pulled out wipes and non-disposable paper from the drain. Another
flood occurred on October 11, 2021 where the plumber found paper and cloth in
the drain. Submitted into evidence was pictures of the basement flood, J-cloths
and paper towels pulled out of the drain, the plumbing invoices which identify
the plumbers having pulled out non-flushable wipes and fibrous cloths from the
Tenants’ drain.
 
10.  The Landlord testified to the damage to the
unit from the flood and other damages discovered throughout the unit;
specifically, garbage, feces, dead rodents, a broken basement window, broken
kitchen cupboards, a door did not close properly, holes in the drywall, among
other things. Attached to the N5 was
a quote from Winmar London, dated September 8, 2021. The quote breaks down
damages found in each area of the unit, quoting $15,037.65 for repair or replacement. The Landlord
testified that this amount was not paid by the Tenants
within seven days this notice was
served, and the Tenants did not
offer to repair the damage.




 
11.  The N7 notice was regarding a second
inspection of the unit on September 15, 2021. It was discovered that there were
further damages. On the date of the inspection, the unit smelled of animal
excrement, there was damage done to the carpets and walls, among other issues.
A copy of a quote from Mebarr Design Build dated September 27, 2021
was attached to the N7 notice.
The quote was detailed and identified the damages, quoting
$39,995.00 plus HST for the damages. The Landlord testified that Mebarr Design
Build did not provide a quote
for any upgrades; rather, the quote only outlined replacements for damages.
 
Law and Analysis
 
12.  On a balance of probabilities, I am not
satisfied the Tenants wilfully caused damage pursuant to section 63 of the Act.
The Landlord led insufficient evidence regarding the Tenant’s intent to cause
the flooding or the damages to the other areas of the home. However, I am
satisfied the Tenants negligently caused damage.
 
13.  In order to be successful in the damages
claim, the Landlord, as the applicant, must establish all of the elements of sections 62 and 89 of the Act. It must be established that a tenant, an
occupant of the rental unit or a person the tenant permitted in the complex
negligently or willfully caused undue damage to the rental unit or complex.
 
14.  The language of section 62 and 89 requires
damage to be undue. It is recognized that some
damage will occur over the regular
course of time, due to regular wear and tear in a
residential complex. Reasonable wear and tear would not normally constitute
“undue damage” (Kamoo v. Brampton Caledon Housing Corp. 2005 O.J. No.
3911).
 
15.  I find that the Tenants negligently caused
the damage regarding the two floods. I am satisfied that the fibrous cloths and
paper caused the blockage. The plumbers’ invoices establish that this was the
cause of the sewer blockage. I am satisfied the Tenants or an occupant or guest
of the Tenants negligently caused the damage because these items were found in
their drain.
 
16.  Regarding
the damage in the other areas of the Tenants’
home, I am also satisfied that the Tenants either wilfully or negligently caused the damage to the other parts of the unit. The Landlord’s uncontested testimony and
the quotes were quite detailed in the damages discovered and what actions
need to be taken to rectify it. I am satisfied that these damages were not a result of regular wear
and tear. I am further satisfied the Tenants did not void the N5 notice by paying the amount required
or repairing the damage within seven days of
being served.
 
17.  The remaining issue is what quantum of
damages should be awarded. The Landlord claimed $35,000.00 for the damages based on the quote from Melbarr Design
Group. I am satisfied that this amount
is reasonable in the circumstances. However, pursuant to section
207 of the Act, the Board’s monetary jurisdiction is $35,000.00. This order has
found that the Tenants are required to pay $7,783.96, representing the
outstanding arrears and the application filing fee.
As such, the Landlord’s damages
claim of $35,000.00 is offset by this
amount.




 
 
 
 
Relief from Eviction
 
18.  I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenants
were not present to disclose any circumstances for me to consider delaying
or denying eviction. As such, I am not satisfied relief should be granted.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
Regarding the L1:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $7,582.96*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so

7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $8,601.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 18, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are




 
only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
 
Regarding the L2:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord

17, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$27,216.04, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and/or
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before January
17, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January
18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after
