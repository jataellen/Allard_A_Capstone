Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:

In the matter
  of:


 
5 HARROGATE COURT BARRIE ON L4M0B9


 




Between:


Angeline Ram


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Wellar


Tenant



 
 
 
Angeline Ram (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Wellar (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose
of residential occupation
 
This application was heard
via videoconference on January 6, 2022.
 
 
Only the Landlord, and the Landlord’s legal representative, Howard Tavroges attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
For the following reasons, we find
that the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord says that she is currently
living with her parents in her childhood home and she would like to move into
her own house. The Landlord gave details about her plans and presented her
testimony in a consistent and forthright manner.
We have no reason to disbelieve her. Based on the
evidence before us, we find that the Landlord genuinely intends to occupy the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation and she intends to do so
for at least one year.
 
2.       
The Landlord filed a valid affidavit with the application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'). Also, the Landlord paid to the Tenant compensation equal to one month's
rent on October 1, 2021, which is prior to the date of termination on the
notice.
 
3.       
As the Landlord’s application complies with the mandatory requirements of the Act, and
as the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit, we find
that the Landlord’s application should be granted.




File Number: CEL-04168-21
 
4.       
We have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated as of February
6, 2022.
 
2.       
The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February
6, 2022.
 
3.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
4.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
