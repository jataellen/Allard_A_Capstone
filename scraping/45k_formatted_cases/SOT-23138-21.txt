and


 




 


Hamid
Kiani Sam Kiani


Landlords



 
 
 
Franco Stina
(the 'Tenant') applied for an order
determining that Hamid Kiani and Sam
Kiani (the 'Landlord Agents') have collected or retained money illegally and
determining the Landlord Agents'entered the rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of the Tenant's
household.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 24,
2021.
 
The Tenant,
the Tenant’s Representative, Angelique Aberdeen, the Landlord
and the Landlord Agent, Sam Kiani attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
T1 application:
 
1.    
There’s no dispute the Landlord failed
to pay the Tenant interest
on last month's
deposit, as required by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
2.    
Section 29(2) of the Act states no application may be made more than one year after the day the alleged conduct giving rise to
the application occurred.
 
3.    
The Tenant is seeking
interest from the date the deposit was collected on February 1, 2018 which is
outside the one-year limitation period. Since the Tenant’s application was
filed on July 8, 2021,
the Board only has jurisdiction to order interest owing within the one year
from the making of the application. As such, interest
is calculated for the period from July 8, 2020 to October 31, 2020 or
$8.74.
 
4.    
Since the last month rent deposit
was applied to November 2020 rent period no interest is owing for period.




 
5.    
There’s no dispute the Landlord collected
a last month rent deposit
which was applied
to the Tenant’s November 2020 rent charges which was the last month of
the tenancy.
 
T2 Application:
 
1.    
On October
27, 2020, the Landlord told the Tenant he
had to move out by November 30, 2020. On October 30, 2020 at 3:39 pm
the Landlord inform the Tenant that the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') did not apply and there was no
requirement for him to provide legal notice of termination or for him to pay
the Tenant one month's compensation.
 
2.    
On November
5, 2020 an argument started
because the Tenant requested a legal notice of termination. The Landlord’s son
called police. The police occurrence report indicates the Landlord identified
the Tenant as a border and wanted the Tenant out. The Police, having been
misled by the Landlord essentially led the Tenant to feel he had no other
choice but to vacate by November 30, 2020.
 
3.    
I find the Landlord’s actions is harassment and the Landlord
has substantially interfered with the Tenant’s rights. The
Landlord contacted the Board in early November 2020 to inform himself and
acknowledges that he was told that if the kitchen and bathroom is NOT shared
then the Act applies. The Landlord, knowing the entranceway and laundry were
the only shared common areas ought to have known that the Act applies and that
his conduct was inappropriate and unwelcome.
 
4.    
The Tenant had a right
to legal notice and the Landlord’s actions by calling the police forced the
Tenant to unwillingly vacate. The Tenant had less than one month to find
alternate accommodations and underwent unnecessary stress and inconvenience having to pack, organize movers and
transport his belongings from Lancaster to Georgetown.
 
5.    
I find the Tenant moved out of the rental unit because of the Landlord and his son’s actions.
The Tenant’s request for $2,500.00 is reasonable given the stress and
harassment caused having forced unlawful eviction.
 
6.    
The Tenant made four
trips back and forth between Ancaster and Georgetown. He did not have an invoice for the movers
because he paid cash. The Landlord
did not challenge the Tenant’s testimony that he paid $1,100.0. I find
the Landlord owes the Tenant for his incurred out of pocket expenses. There was
no evidence led about storage costs.
 
7.    
The issue that the
Landlord unlawful entry the Tenant’s unit was not considered given there were no details
on the application for the Landlord to know the case required
to be met.
 
8.    
The total amount the Landlord owes the Tenant
is $3,608.74 ($8.74+$2,500.00+
$1,100.00).
 
9.    
The Landlord
also owes $53.00 for the cost of the application.
 
It is ordered that:




 
 
 
1.    
The Landlord
Agents shall pay to the Tenant the sum of
$3,608.74.
 
2.    
The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.    
The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing on or before January
31, 2022.
 
4.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenant
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Landlord will start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
February 1, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
The Tenant
has the right,
at any time, to collect
the full amount
owing or any balance
outstanding under this order.
