Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
SOL-25052-21
 



In the matter
of:


B054, 30 BRADMON DRIVE ST. CATHARINES ON L2M6T7


 




Between:


Panoramic Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Daniel Laveck Eva
Gospodarek


Tenants



 
 
Panoramic Properties Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Daniel Laveck and Eva Gospodarek (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on January 18, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Jennifer Ricci, attended the hearing. As of 10:14 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay
for the period from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit increased to $1,701.36.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,645.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from August
13, 2018 to September 21, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $5,392.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




File Number: SOL-25052-21
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $45.88*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants: $55.94 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of
the unit, and $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
The Landlord
or the Tenants shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant
possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
7.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$2,035.12 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$3,736.48 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
