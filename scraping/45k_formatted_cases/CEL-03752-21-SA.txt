Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03752-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


506, 31 PENETANG STREET BARRIE ON L4M6E8


 




Between:


Barrie Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephanie North


Tenant



 
 
 
Barrie Housing
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Stephanie North (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on October 4, 2021 with respect to application CEL-01390-21-SA.
 
The Landlord's
application was resolved by order CEL-03752-21, issued on December 10, 2021.
The Tenant filed a motion to set aside order CEL-03752-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022. Only the Tenant attended the
hearing. As of 9:22 a.m., the Landlord was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order CEL-01390-21 provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in
the order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of the Act, alleging
that the Tenant
failed to pay the $2,000.00 on October 14, 2021, contrary to the order.
This resulted in ex parte eviction order CEL-03752-21 terminating the tenancy.
 
3.    
In support of the motion to set aside the order, the Tenant testified that she failed to make
the payment on October 14, 2021
because Housing Retention who made
the payment on her behalf on October
23, 2021 were unable to contact the Landlord prior to that date.
 
4.    
Although the
Tenant breached the order, section 78(11)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 provides that the Board shall set aside the eviction order if the Board is satisfied,
having regard to all the circumstances, that it would not be unfair to do so. The Tenant did




File Number: CEL-03752-21-SA
 
ultimately end
up paying the amount owed, and in this circumstance, it is not unfair to set
aside the order.
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion to set aside order
CEL-03752-21, issued on December 10, 2021, is granted. The order cannot be
enforced by the Landlord.
 
2.    
The order issued by the Board on October
4, 2021 with respect to application
CEL-01390- 21-SA continues in effect.
