Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-24486-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1414, 1251
KING STREET W TORONTO ON M6K1G7


 




Between:


Nuspor Investments


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Agatha Grant


Tenant



 
 
 
Nuspor Investments (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Agatha Grant
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
The Landlord also claimed NSF cheque charges and related administration
charges.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 12, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Vicky Liu, attended
the hearing. As of 2:37 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
23, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $967.58.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $967.58
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     The Landlord incurred
charges of $7.00 for a cheque tendered
by or on behalf of the
Tenant, which was returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $4,891.74 after the application was filed.
 
7.     The only amounts
outstanding are $0.16 in rent arrears and the Landlord's cost of
$186.00 in filing
the application. As a result,
the order will be limited these amounts only and not
eviction.
