Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04567-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 115 DUFFERIN STREET ORANGEVILLE ON L9W1X4


 




Between:


Brian Rooney


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mariah Rafuse
  Mike King


Tenants



 
 
 
Brian Rooney (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mariah Rafuse and Mike King (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January 17, 2022 with
respect to application CEL-02844-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlord
$1,286.00 on or before January
28, 2022 towards arrears of
rent and costs. The Tenants paid
$1,000.00.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $1,286.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-02844-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $286.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
CEL-02844-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants
paid the lawful rent from February 1, 2022
to February 28, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,100.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from August 1, 2020 to
February 22, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order CEL-02844-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 5, 2022.
 
3.    
As of the date of this order, the
Tenants owe no money to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears of rent, that the Landlord is entitled to under this
order by $1,119.48.
 
4.    
The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount
the Landlord owes the Tenants:
$36.16 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Landlord or the Tenants shall pay any amounts that become owing
as a result of this order.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2022, then starting March
6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
 
February 22, 2022

The tenant has until March 4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under s. 78(9) of the Act. If
the tenant files the motion by March 4, 2022 the order will be stayed and the
Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on September 6, 2022
if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental
unit is located.
