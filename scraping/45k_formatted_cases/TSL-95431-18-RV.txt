Order under Section 21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-95431-18-RV










 
 

Review Order
 
T.A.M.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.M
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent and
compensation the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in order TSL-93645-18 issued on April 10, 2018.
 
This
application was resolved by order TSL-95431-18 issued on May 18, 2018.
 
On
May 28, 2018 the Tenant filed a motion to set aside the aforementioned order
and the Board scheduled a hearing.
 
The
set aside hearing was heard in Toronto on June 28, 2018, and it was resolved by
order TSL-95431-18-SA issued on August 7, 2018.
 
On
August 30, 2018, the Landlord requested a review of order TSL-95431-18-SA
issued on August 7, 2018.
 
The
request to review was heard in Toronto on October 4, 2018.
 
Only
the Landlord’s legal representative, Sean Beard, attended the hearing. I was satisfied that the Tenant had received the Notice of
Hearing and there was no request to adjourn before me.  Based on this, I
proceeded to hear the application on the basis of the materials before me and
the submissions of the Landlord.
            


Determinations:
 
Request
for Review
1.      The
Landlord requested a review on the basis that a serious error had been made in
the calculations of the arrears owing in the order resulting from the set aside
motion that issued on August 7, 2018.  
2.      The
Landlord’s representative noted that the arrears to April 30, 2018, as
reflected in the original order of April 10, 2018, had not been reduced.  Since
the original order, the Tenant has failed to pay rent for the months of May
through October, 2018.  The Tenant has been credited with $2,000.00 in
payments, referenced in the second conditional order issued on August 7, 2018. 

3.      Based
on the unopposed evidence of the Landlord, I find that there was a serious
error concerning the arrears owed by the Tenant in the order of August 7,
2018.  The review request is granted and the order issued on August 7, 2018 is
cancelled.  
Landlord’s
Application
4.      The
Landlord has satisfied me that the amount of $13,238.80 is owing to October 31,
2018.  The Tenant has twice been given conditional orders to pay the arrears
off through a payment plan, and has failed to maintain the payment plan each
time.  
5.      I
find that the Tenant has breached the conditions of the order TSL-95431-18
issued on April 10, 2018 on her own admission as recorded in the order
TSL-95431-18 SA issued on August 7, 2018.  
6.      The
original order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of
rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request
an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
7.      I
also find on the unopposed representations of the Landlord’s representative,
that having consideration to all the circumstances, it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction because the Tenant has not complied with any terms of
either of the previous conditional orders and has not paid any rent in six
months.  
8.      The
amount that was owing, according to the terms of the mediated settlement, for
arrears of rent and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application is $4,155.00.
9.      The Tenant
paid the Landlord $2,000.00 since the application was filed.
10.   The
Landlord paid the Tenant $12.31 for interest on the last month rent deposit to
December 31, 2017, and this amount will be offset against the arrears.
11.   Since
the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from May 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.
12.   The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $1,852.76.
13.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,820.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
14.   Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018
to October 10, 2018.
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
request to review is granted. Order TSL-95431-18-SA issued on August 7, 2018 is
cancelled and replaced by the following order.
2.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before October 22, 2018.
3.      The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord 10,137.45*. This amount represents the rent owing up
to October 11, 2018 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit, less the payment of $12.31 made by Landlord.
4.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $60.91 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting October 12, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
5.      If the
Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 22,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from October 23, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 22, 2018, then starting October 23,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after October 23,
2018.
8.      Due
to a potential Canada Post strike, the Landlord, upon receipt of this order
must give a copy of this order to the Tenant by a method set out in subsection
191(1) of the Act, other than by sending it by mail or courier to the last
known address where the Tenant resides or carries on business.
