Order under Section
31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNT-17129-19
 
 
 
MW and YW (the
'Tenants') applied for an order
determining that SCY (the
'Landlord'), or the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent,
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household and
withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital
service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under
the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on February 26, 2020 and in video conference room 126
on November 23, 2021.
 
The Tenants,
the Tenants’ representative, W. P, and the Landlord’s representative, C.
Ch, attended the hearing on November 23, 2021.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Although the Tenants filed an application under section 31 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the
application should have been filed under section
30 of the Act. At the February 26, 2020 hearing, the Tenant advised that they
would amend their application.
 
2.     The Board’s record shows that the Tenants
did not amend this application. At the
November 23, 2021 hearing, the Tenants’ representative advised that the Tenants have filed a new application under the
correct section of the Act, TNT-25001-20. That
application was not before the Board on November 23, 2021.
 
3.    
Because this present application
was filed incorrectly and was not amended, this application shall be dismissed. This order does not, however,
affect Board File Number
TNT-25001-20.
