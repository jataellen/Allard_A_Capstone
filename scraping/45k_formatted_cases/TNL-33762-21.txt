Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number: TNL-33762-21
 



In the matter
of:


303, 75 HURON HEIGHTS DRIVE NEWMARKET ON L3Y5V8


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Yi Liu


Tenant



 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Yi Liu (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has
committed an illegal act or has carried
out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal
trade, business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential
complex.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative Geoff Paine attended the hearing.
As of 2:20 p.m., the Tenant
was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The residential complex
is a three (3) storey
multi unit apartment building.
 
2.     The Landlords’ application is based on multiple
notices of termination given to the Tenant,
in particular a (N6) notice
of termination served
pursuant to Section
61(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ’Act’).
 
3.     On July 15, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenant with a (N6) form notice to end
the tenancy setting out a termination date of August
13, 2021, because
the Tenant or an occupant of that rental unit committed
an illegal act in the rental unit or residential complex.
 
4.    
The notice alleges that on April 21, 2021, the Landlord
was served with a warrant
to produce records relating to the lease holder for suite 303, the
Tenant’s rental unit.
 
5.     On June 11, 2021 a search warrant
was conducted by Police on Suite 303, the Tenant’s rental unit and during the search
the Police discovered a female occupant. The female occupant was treated as a
victim of human trafficking. The Tenant was charged for operating a brothel
from the rental unit in the residential complex.




 
 
 
6.    
Subsection 61(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act (the RTA) provides:
 
61.(1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit
commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation
or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential complex.
 
7.     The term "illegal" is not defined
in the RTA but would include a serious violation
of a federal, provincial or
municipal law. If the illegality is trivial or technical, the act or business or occupation might not be considered serious
enough to warrant
eviction.
 
8.     The issue to be determined in this case -
has the Tenant committed an illegal
act in the rental unit or the residential complex, and if so, was the
act to be considered serious enough to warrant eviction of the Tenant.
 
9.    
On any application, but especially on an application like this, the Landlord cannot
simply make general allegations against a Tenant and expect termination
of the tenancy.
 
10.  The fact that a tenant
or other occupant
has been charged
with an offence
is not necessarily proof that
an illegal act was committed.
 
11.  Section 75 of the RTA provides that the Board may
evict a tenant for an illegal act whether or not the tenant or other person has been
convicted of an offence relating
to the illegal act.
 
12. 
Based on the
Landlord’s uncontested testimony and application, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant committed an illegal act in
the rental unit and
residential complex.
 
13.  The Tenant did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
14.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
15.  Subject to clause 83 (1) (b), the Board shall,
in an order based on a notice
given under section 61(1)
request that the sheriff expedite the enforcement of the order.
 
16.  In this case, I have found that the
Tenant has committed an illegal act in
the residential complex,
therefore, I grant expedited enforcement on this order.
 
17.  The order shall request
the Sheriff to expedite the enforcement of the order.
 
18.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,332.98 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021.




 
19.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of February 7,
2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 7, 2022, then starting February
8, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 8, 2022. The
Sheriff is requested to
expedite the enforcement of this order.
