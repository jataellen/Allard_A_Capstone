Review Order
 
Galaxy Value Add Ontario
Properties LP and Northview Apartment Reit (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict William
Tindale (WT) and Darlene Blundon- Tindale (D B-T)(the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-44052-20 issued on March
25, 2021. On November 9,
2021, the Tenants requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 28, 2022.
 
The Landlords’ legal representative M. Melchers and the Tenant
WT attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.     The Tenants’ request
for a review is based on the ground of being not reasonably able to
participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to this review request
took place on October 19, 2021. The Tenants did not attend and they did
not send a representative.
 
3.     At the review hearing WT testified that he lost his
telephone the night before the hearing and he tried
to borrow a phone from neighbours but none of his neighbours would assist. WT testified
that he went to his local library
to ask to use a computer but they told him he had to book it in advance.




 
4.    
The Landlords’ legal
representative pointed out that the Tenants had not paid rent since August 2020
(a fact admitted by WT) and that in June 2021 after the matter was adjourned at WT’s request
a direction was issued by the Board requiring payment
of June 2021 rent by June 11,
2021, the payment of monthly rent to the Landlord thereafter, and the disclosure and filing of documentation supporting that WT’s son was in the hospital
on the day of the June 2021 hearing. The Tenants did not comply with the
payment provisions of the order and they did not provide the required
documentation to the Landlord. WT gave no reason for failing to make payments
in contravention of the direction and his reason for not providing
documentation to the Landlord was that the direction did not require him to do
so (it did). WT testified that he filed the required documentation to the Board
in June 2021; however, the Board’s records do not indicate anything filed by
the Tenants in the spring or summer of 2021.
 
5.    
In Kathryn King-Winton v.
Doverhold Investments 2008 CanLII 60708 (ON SCDC), the Divisional Court
stated: “Being reasonably able to participate in the proceeding must be
interpreted broadly, natural justice
requires no less.” Interpreting this
situation broadly, it is unfortunate that the Tenants failed to comply with the
directions that were made in response to their adjournment request.
The Landlord’s legal
representative’s suggestion
that the Tenants have conducted themselves in a way that appears to be designed
to cause delay has some merit. However, in the interests of natural justice,
and because it does not significantly prejudice the Landlord, I find that the Tenants
were not reasonably able to participate in the
proceedings. Accordingly, at the review hearing I granted the Tenants’ request
for a review and the Landlords’ L1 application was heard de novo.
 
L1 application
 
6.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from February 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective March
22, 2020.
 
7.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit
 
8.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,125.09 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
9.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2021 to March 22, 2020.
 
10.  The monthly rent is
$1,138.58.
 
11.  It is uncontested that the Tenants owe $19,821.97 in
arrears to January 31, 2022 and that, with the filing fee of $175.00,
the total amount owed by the Tenants
is $19,996.97.
 
12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
13.  I have
considered that this is a
six year tenancy, that the Tenants have
two children living with them (aged 13 and 20), that their children have
disabilities, and that the Tenant D B- T has disabilities. I have also
considered that the amount owed is
nearly $20,000.00, that the Tenants have made no payments to the Landlord in
the last 17 months even though they have received some income during this time
and that they have given no plausible reason
for failing to make any payments during
this time (WT testified that in August
2020 D B-T had to help pay the costs of a funeral). Further, WT
testified that a third party agency is willing to cover the entire cost of the
arrears. Considering all of these circumstances, it is not unfair to postpone
the eviction to February 28, 2022 to give the Tenants an opportunity to either
find alternate housing or have the arrears paid by a third party.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-44052-20 issued
on March 23, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $18,789.91*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 3, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $37.43 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 4, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlords $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $21,135.55** to the Landlords or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are




 
only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlords.
