In the matter
of:


157,
  4950 ALBINA WAY MISSISSAUGA ON L4Z4J7


 




Between:


Nader Guirguis

Tenants




 


and


 




 


Noor Saleem


Landlord



 
Nader Guirguis (NG) and Walid Bouassi
(WB) (the 'Tenants') applied for an order determining that Noor Saleem (the
'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on October 21, 2021.
The Tenants and the Landlord attended the hearing.
Background and Determinations:
 
1.     A copy of the original Tenancy Agreement entered into
between the Landlord and then named Tenant Walid Bouassi dated May 26, 2010 was submitted setting
the monthly rent first charged was $1,600.00, and
that the Landlord collected a first and last month rent deposit.
 
2.     It was initially unclear to me based on the Tenancy
Agreement (TA) documentation filed with the application, who was the applicant that filed the application. It was acknowledged by both the named Tenants
and the Landlord that the original TA was later amended in June 2015 to include
NG and WB as co-tenants, and as of September 1, 2015 the monthly rent was then
$1,750.00.
 
3.     The Tenant submitted a copy of an email from the
Landlord to the Tenants dated November 30, 2019 effectively giving the Tenants
60 days written notice that the Landlord required possession of the rental
unit for her own use with a termination date of
January 31, 2020.
 
4.     The Tenants moved
out of the rental unit on February
3, 2020 in accordance with the
notice given to them by the Landlord.
 
5.     The issues in the Tenant’s
application is that the Landlord
a)    
collected rent in excess
of the amount allowed by the Act and
retained money illegally.




 
b)    
the Landlord failed to pay the Tenants compensation for termination of the
tenancy pursuant to section 48(1) as required by the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
6.     Section 135(1) of the Act allows a Tenant to apply to the Board for an order that the
Landlord pay to the Tenant any money that a landlord has collected or retained
in contravention of the Act.
 
7.     The Tenants assert that the rent charged
by the Landlord is illegal as they did not receive a notice of rent increase and the rate of increase charged
exceeds the guideline amount.
 
8.    
The Rent Increase Guideline
(‘guideline’) is set on an annual basis by the Provincial government
establishing the maximum amount that a landlord can increase a tenant’s rent without
the approval of the Board. Landlords may only increase
a sitting tenant’s
rent once every 12 months by the guideline amount.
 
9.     The relevant provisions of the Act are:
Notice of rent increase required
116 (1) A landlord
shall not increase
the rent charged
to a tenant for a rental unit without first giving the tenant at least 90 days written (N1) notice of
the landlord’s intention to do so.
Increase void without
notice
116 (4) An increase
in rent is void if the landlord
has not given the notice required by this section, and the landlord must give a new
notice before the landlord can take the increase.
 
Money collected illegally
135 
(1) A tenant or former tenant of a rental unit may apply to the
Board for an order that the landlord or agent of
the landlord pay to the tenant any money the person collected
or retained in contravention of this Act.
 
Rent increase deemed
not void
135.1 
(1) An increase in rent that would otherwise be void under
subsection 116 (4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant has paid the increased
rent in respect of each rental
period for at least
12 consecutive months.
 
Time limitation
135 (4) No order shall be made under this section
with respect to an application filed more than one
year after the person collected or retained money
in contravention of this
Act or the Tenant Protection
Act, 1997
 
Rent deemed lawful
136 (1) Rent charged one or more
years earlier shall be deemed to be lawful rent unless an application has been made within one year after
the date that amount was first charged and the
lawfulness of the rent charged is in issue in the application




 
Increase deemed lawful
136 (2) An increase
in rent shall be deemed to be lawful unless
an application has been made within one year after the date the
increase was first charged and the lawfulness of the rent increase is in issue
in the application.
 
10.  It was undisputed that the Landlord did not serve the Tenants with a recent
notice of rent increase pursuant to the Act, and
that the annual rent increase charged by the Landlord was in excess of the
guideline amount.
 
11.  Effective July 21, 2020, as a result of the Protecting
Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020, there was a new section
135.1 added to the Act. It states the following:
 
135.1
(1)  An increase in rent that
would otherwise be void under subsection 116 (4) is deemed not to be void if the tenant
has paid the increased rent in respect
of each rental period for at
least 12 consecutive months.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply with respect to an increase
in rent if the tenant has, within one year after the date
the increase was first charged, made an application in which the validity of
the rent increase is in issue.
(3)  For greater certainty, if subsection (1) applies with respect to an increase
in rent, section 116 is deemed to have been complied with.
(4)  For greater certainty, nothing
in this section limits the application of section
136.
(5)  This section applies with
respect to an increase in rent even if it was first charged before the day the
Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020 receives
Royal Assent, provided
the validity of the rent increase
was not finally determined by the Board before that day.
 
12.  As a result of the new section 135.1, even if a
landlord increased the rent without serving a
tenant with any notice of rent increase, the otherwise unlawful
rent increased is deemed
to be valid if the tenant
pays the increased rent for a year without
filing an application with the Board challenging the lawfulness of the increase.
 
13.  Clearly under subsection 136(1) of the Act, if a tenant
acquiesces to the payment of an otherwise unlawful rent for more
than twelve months, the unlawful amount is deemed lawful, and the intent of
section 136 is to prevent those who knowingly pay more than their lawful rent
for longer than twelve months from commencing proceedings on that account.
 
14.  The twelve-month rule under section 136 does not limit
the Tenants’ claim to the preceding twelve months
during which the unlawful amount
was paid. In this instance, the twelve-month deeming rule under
section 136 did not start running against the Tenant until the date of the
application February 6, 2020, the claim goes back to the date September 1,
2018, when the purported unlawful rent was first charged.




 
15.  Consequently, because the unlawful rent was first
charged back September 1, 2018, more than one year before the Tenants filed
this application, and the fact the tenants acquiesced to the payment
of an otherwise unlawful rent for more than twelve
months, the unlawful amount is deemed lawful pursuant to 136 (2) of the
Act.
 
16.  Therefore the lawful
rent is deemed $2,000.00 and the Landlord
has not collected
money in excess of the amount allowed by the Act.
 
17.  The issue relating
to the notice to end the tenancy
given to the Tenants pursuant
to section 48(1) as required by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
18.  On November 30, 2019 the Tenants were effectively given a (N12)
type Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord
required possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
for Landlord’s own
use.
 
19.  The termination date in the (N12) notice
was January 31, 2021.
 
20.  Section 48.1 of the Act requires a landlord who has
served a tenant with an N12 type notice pursuant to section 48 to pay compensation to the tenants
in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
21.  Section 55.1 of the Act requires the compensation must
be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
22.   As of the date of the hearing
the Landlord had not paid to
the Tenants the required
compensation equal to one-month rent.
 
23.   Therefore, the Landlord
has retained money
illegally and shall be ordered to pay to the
Tenants the required compensation equal to one-month
rent deemed to be $2,000.00.
 
24.   This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord shall pay to the Tenants
$2,000.00*, the required
one-month compensation
pursuant to section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
2.     The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants $50.00*
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     The Landlord shall pay the total amount
owing** to the Tenants on or before February 15, 2022.




 
4.    
If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants
the full amount
owing on or before
February 15, 2022, the Landlord will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.     If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants the full
amount owing* on or before February 15, 2022, the Tenants have the right, at any time thereafter to collect from the
Landlord the full amount owing or any balance outstanding as a result of this
order.
