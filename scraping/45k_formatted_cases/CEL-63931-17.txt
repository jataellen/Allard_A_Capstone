In the matter of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


M S


Landlord




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


M F


Tenant




 


 


 



 
M S (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict M F (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did
not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 Application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant; and because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date (L2 Application).
 
This application was heard in Port Elgin on
February 28, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing.  The Tenant was assisted by a friend, A. P.
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
 
Regarding L1
Application (rent arrears)
 
1.     
The monthly rent is $1,000.00.
2.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2016 to February 28,
2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective December 16, 2016.
Regarding L2
Application (N5 Notice)
 
3.     
On December 2, 2016, the Landlord served the
Tenant with an N5 Notice in accordance with sub sections 64(1) and 62(1) of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The N5 Notice has a
termination date of December 22, 2016 and alleges that:
a)    The Tenant is harassing and substantially interfering with the
reasonable enjoyment of the Landlord through numerous phone calls, voicemails
and unannounced visits to the Landlord’s home;
b)    The Tenant damaged the front room ceiling, walls and floor due to
“brewing kegs of homemade wine” which exploded all over the room. The Landlord
claimed  $320.00 to repair the alleged property damage.
4.     
The N5 Notice sets out the dates, times and
specific allegations against the Tenant.
5.     
Because this is a first N5 Notice, the Tenant
has an opportunity to void the notice in accordance with sub section 64(3) of
the Act by correcting the identified problems within seven days of the date the
notice was served. In this case, the seven day period begins the day following
service of the N5 Notice, from December 3, 2016 to December 9, 2016. The
Landlord confirmed that the N5 Notice was not voided and that the Tenant did
not pay $320.00 for the alleged damages claimed in the N5 notice.
6.     
The Landlord testified:
a)    The Tenant is her biological father;
b)    The Tenant was brewing wine in the front room of the home and the
red wine “exploded” and stained the ceiling, walls and floor. The Landlord
submitted photos of the front room;
c)    The Landlord gave notice to enter to replace the battery for the
furnace and the Tenant denied entry and police were called;
d)    The Tenant is not co-operative and verbally abusive such that the
Landlord went to the police.  He withheld rent in return for personal favours,
forced his way in and used the Landlord’s cottage, requested help in paying bills
and constantly calls the Landlord with unreasonable requests.  He does not
respect boundaries. He caused a “scene” when the roof was re-shingled and
damaged the workers’ truck. When he comes to her house, he throws temper
tantrums.
7.     
The Tenant admitted responsibility for the red
wine stains on the ceiling of the front room. He testified that the container
of red wine was corked and the cork popped causing wine to spray on the
ceiling.  He said he paid his grandson to clean the stains.
Wilful or
negligent damage – front room
 
8.     
Section 62(1) of the Act states that a landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination if the tenant wilfully or negligently
causes undue damage to the rental unit.
9.     
I am not satisfied that the conduct of the
Tenant was negligent or that the wine stains on the ceiling is representative
of undue damage.  
10.  
“Conduct is negligent if there is a risk of
damage which a reasonable person would take reasonable precautions against” (Bolton
v. Stone [1951] A.C. 850).  Further, “If a person reasonably, albeit
mistakenly, believes that there is no risk then the conduct is not negligent” (Beutler
v. Beutler [1983] O.J. No. 505 at para. 148).
11.  
Wilful conduct means with intent or deliberate.
12.  
The Tenant placed a cork in the container of
wine which shows that he took reasonable precautions against spillage.  The
fact that the cork popped and caused the wine to spray the ceiling and spill
onto the floor was not reasonably foreseeable.  As a consequence, the Tenant’s
conduct was not negligent.  The facts do not demonstrate any intent by the
Tenant to spray wine on the ceiling and floor.
13.  
I am not satisfied that the stains on the
ceiling and the faint spot on the floor are representative of undue damage. 
Undue suggests some damage is acceptable.  The stains on the ceiling and floor
are akin to normal wear and tear.  
14.  
As the Landlord has not met the test under
section 62(1), this claim is dismissed. In any event, the Landlord did not
substantiate the remedy claimed of $320.00 with a quote or other similar evidence. 
 
15.  
The Landlord’s claim regarding damage caused by
hooks on a ceiling beam is dismissed because the Landlord did not explain how the
hooks caused undue damage.
Substantial
interference 
 
16.  
Asking someone to read your mail to them, show
them how to pay bills, smoke fish for them and not respecting boundaries indicates
that the Landlord’s allegations are representative of personal issues between
members of a family rather than those between a Landlord and Tenant.  This does
not represent substantial interference of reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex by the Landlord or harassment and this claim is dismissed.
17.  
The issues claimed by the Landlord that occurred
at her home did not occur at the residential complex and therefore do not
substantially interfere with her reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex. This claim is dismissed.
18.  
The Landlord’s claim that the Tenant damaged the
roofing worker’s truck is dismissed. The Landlord did not provide sufficient
details regarding this claim or any supporting evidence regarding this alleged
damage.
19.  
The Landlord did not provide sufficient details
such as dates and times, to support a finding of harassment or substantial
interference regarding her complaints that the Tenant demanded she come over to
change a light bulb, wanted a new kitchen tap and made numerous calls regarding
the thermostat “flashing”.  These claims are dismissed.
20.  
The Landlord failed to substantiate her claim
regarding denial of entry to the rental unit to replace the battery for the
furnace on December 1, 2016.  A notice to enter was not provided and no details
regarding police involvement were submitted.  In any event, a single event is
not indicative of substantial interference. This claim is dismissed.  
21.  
The Landlord led evidence that the Tenant failed
to maintain the unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness.  However, these issues
were not raised in the N5 Notices which formed the basis of the L2 Application
and are not relevant to a finding of a substantial interference or wilful or
negligent damage. 
Regarding L2 Application (N12 Notice –
Landlord own use)
 
22.  
The Landlord served the Tenant with an N12
notice of termination effective January 31, 2017 claiming the Landlord intended
to move into the rental unit.
23.  
The Landlord testified that she intends to move
into the rental unit to use the unit for her home based business and for other
business purposes.
24.  
Subsection 48(1) of the Act states:
A landlord may, by notice, terminate a
tenancy if the landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit
for the purpose of residential occupation by,
(a) the
landlord;
(b) the
landlord’s spouse;
(c) a child or
parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse; or
(d) a person who
provides or will provide care services to the landlord, the landlord’s spouse,
or a child or parent of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse, if the person
receiving the care services resides or will reside in the building, related
group of buildings, mobile home park or land lease community in which the
rental unit is located.  
 
25.  
The term “residential occupation” is not defined
in the Act. However, the Court has stated in various decisions that residential
occupation is generally understood to mean the property will be used as the
person’s main residence and requires more than occasional or temporary use of
the unit.
26.  
Based on the Landlord’s evidence, the test of
residential occupation has not been met. It is clear from the Landlord’s own
evidence that the property will not be the main residence of the Landlord and
she intends to use the unit for business purposes, not residential occupation. 
This claim is dismissed.
Relief from eviction (L1 Application)
27.  
The Tenant testified that his source of income
is retirement benefits of about $1,800 per month.  He has a hearing impairment
and relies on oxygen for breathing purposes.  If evicted, he requested until
April to find another home.
28.  
The Landlord said that she will lose her house
if the arrears are not paid because she is using credit to pay bills and the
mortgage.
29.  
I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it
would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the conditions
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
30.  
In granting relief, I am
taking into account the submissions of the Landlord and her financial obligations,
and balancing that against the Tenant’s disclosed circumstances. Therefore the
relief from eviction is subject to conditions set out in this order which, if
not met, would allow the Landlord to apply to the Board, without further notice
to the Tenant, for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant
pursuant to section 78 of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
L2 Application
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed.
L1 Application (rent
owing)
 
2.      The Tenant shall pay the Landlord $3,500.00
which represents the amount of rent arrears owing up to March 31, 2017.
3.      The Tenant shall also pay the Landlord $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
4.      The Tenant shall pay the Landlord the full
amount owing of $3,690.00, and the additional rent that comes due, as follows:
a.    On or before April 1, 2017                   April
rent
b.    On or before April 30, 2017                 $3,690.00
(arrears and filing fee)
5.      If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments
ordered in paragraph 4, in full and on time, the Landlord may apply under
section 78 of the Act, without notice to the Tenant for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make this application no
later than 30 days after the Tenant’s failure to make a payment.
