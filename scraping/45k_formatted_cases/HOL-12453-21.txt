Order under
Subsection 87(1)
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: HOL-12453-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
22 SWENSON STREET ALLISTON ON L9R0J8


 




Between:


Nalina Armoogam


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Michelle Rakowski


Tenant



 
 
 
Nalina Armoogam (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring Michelle Rakowski (the 'Tenant')
to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February
1, 2022. Only the Landlord attended the hearing. As of 4 p.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant did not pay the total rent
the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
September 3, 2021 to November 12, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on
November 12, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $1,900.00.
 
4.     The Tenant
has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.     The Landlord previously gave the Tenant
an N12 notice to terminate
the tenancy with a
termination date of October 31, 2021. Where a landlord has given an N12 notice
to terminate the tenancy, the
tenancy ends on the date that the landlord knew or ought to have known that the
tenant had vacated the rental unit, if the tenant vacated the rental unit
without giving a notice of earlier termination (s.88(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006).
 
7.     In this case,
the tenancy terminates on November 12, 2021 when the Landlord
was informed by the Tenant that she had vacated the rental unit.
