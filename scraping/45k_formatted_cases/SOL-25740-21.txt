Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25740-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


8, 229 MOHAWK
ROAD E HAMILTON ON L9A2H6


 




Between:


Valor Properties Inc.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


El Husain
  Abubakr


Tenant



 
 
 
Valor Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict El Husain
Abubakr (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February
2, 2022. As of 11:58
a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Glen Gosling, attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Based on the particulars contained
in the N8 Notice of Eviction served
to the Tenant on October 12,
2021, I find that from July 2021 to October 12, 2021, the Tenant was late
paying their rent every month of the 4-month period.
 
2.     The monthly rent was $650.75
and was raised
to $658.56 effective
January 1, 2022. The
Landlord is not holding a last month rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Landlord's Legal
Representative submitted that the Landlord is seeking termination of the
tenancy due to the persistently late payment, plus the Tenant has only made one
payment, $650.00 on December 1, 202, since the application was filed. The tenant ledger entered into evidence indicates the
total rent outstanding to the date of hearing as
$3,370.87. The Landlord is also seeking
the application filing
fee.
 
4.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. There has ben no good faith

effort to pay the rent on time since the application was filed, further
the Tenant did not
attend to advise of any circumstances to take into consideration.
 
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
19, 2021. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenant will start
to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.
