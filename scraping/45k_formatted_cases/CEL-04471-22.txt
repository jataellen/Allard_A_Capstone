On December

the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 12, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
