Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44034-21
NOL-44147-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


101, 122 GIROUX
STREET NORTH BAY ON P1B7Y7


 




Between:


Paul Enqvist


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Roxanne
Johnson


Tenant



 
 
 
Paul Enqvist
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Roxanne Johnson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord
has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
10, 2022. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord
filed application NOL-44034-21 on September 27, 2021. Due to increase
damages to the rental unit and the fact
the matter had not be heard the Landlord filed a second application
NOL-44147-21 on October 11, 2021. Both
applications were scheduled and heard at the same time.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Photographs of the
rental unit show extensive and wilful damage to the rental unit. Cabinet doors have been ripped off. The are large holes in the drywall. Kitchen
cabinets have been torn out. The
flooring has been torn up. The
bathroom vanity has been removed. Baseboards
and window trim have been removed. There
is a flood that extends to the hallway.
 
2.    
I find the Tenant, an
occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the Tenant,
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental
unit and the residential complex.




File Number: NOL-44034-21
NOL-44147-21
3.    
Based on the evidence
before me, I find the Landlord will incur costs that will exceed the
$12,000.00 claimed
in the two applications.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated, as of January
24, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,000.00, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage and
replacing the damaged property.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January
25, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 25, 2022.
