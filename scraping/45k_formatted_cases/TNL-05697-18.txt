Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-05697-18










 
 

MPIL (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict AS (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay
the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application). 
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late
in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 application).
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 26,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s
representative, DR attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to
July 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the unit.
3.     
This is a month to month
tenancy. The rent is due on the first day of each month.
4.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $1,590.29.
5.     
The Tenant did not make any
payments after the application was filed.
6.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.
7.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,590.29 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
8.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.
9.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application – Eviction for
Arrears of Rent
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as of August 7, 2018.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before August 7, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,968.12*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to July 27, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $52.28 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
July 28, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before August 7, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
August 8, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 7, 2018, then starting August 8, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after August 8, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
the portion of the order pertaining to the rent arrears and continue the
tenancy to August 7, 2018, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust:
i)        $4,960.87 if the payment is made on or before July 31, 2018, or
ii)       $6,551.16 if the payment is made on or before August 7, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside the portion of the
order pertaining to rent arrears if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after August 8, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
L2 application -

10.  
Despite paragraphs eight and
nine, above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated as
of August 7, 2018. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before August

11.   If the unit is not vacated on or before August
7, 2018, then starting August 8, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
12.   Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after August 8, 2018.
