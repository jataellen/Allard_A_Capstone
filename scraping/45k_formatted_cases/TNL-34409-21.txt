Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006

In the
  matter of:


39 MARSHVIEW AVENUE AURORA ON L4G7W5


 




Between:


Oyindamola &
Olumide Olorode


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Sharon Annis


Tenant



 
 
 
Oyindamola & Olumide Olorode
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sharon Annis (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord
requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
3, 2022. The Landlords,
represented by Adeola Oguntade, and the Tenant, represented by Zeeshan Rahman,
attended the hearing.
 
The Tenant’s representative
requested an adjournment because she was retained on the day before the hearing. Considering the fact the N12 notice
was served on the Tenant
on August 19, 2021 and the application was filed
with the Board on August 30, 2021, I find the Tenant had ample time to retain a
representative prior to the hearing and that a delay would be unfair to the
Landlord having waited five months for a hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The termination date on the N12 notice
served on the Tenant is October 23, 2021.
 
2.     The tenancy commenced on May 15, 2016. After the end of the term of the tenancy
agreement the tenancy became a month to month tenancy.
As such the end of a term of
the tenancy falls on the 14th day of a month. Section 48.2 of the Residential Tenancies Act states that
the termination date shall be the last day of a term.
 
3.    
The Landlord testified that the parties
agreed that the Tenant could
pay rent on the 23rd day of
the month.
 
4.    
I find this agreement does not
change the term of the tenancy. Section
38 of the Act provides that when a fixed term ends and the agreement has not
been renewed or terminated, the landlord
and the tenant shall be deemed to have renewed
it as a monthly tenancy
agreement containing the same terms and conditions.

5.     I find the notice to terminate the tenancy does not comply with section
48.2 of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlords’ application is dismissed.
