Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-22778-21-AM
 
 
In the matter of:      1105, 9 CRESCENT
PLACE
EAST YORK ON M4C5L8
 
Between:                  Pinedale Properties Inc.                                                                               Landlord

Tenants




 
 
Amended Order
 
On January 31, 2022, the Landlord requested to amend a
clerical error in the original order to correct the Tenant’s first name from
“Trevel” to “Trevor”. The notice of termination (N4 notice) contains the
correct spelling of the Tenant and the Tenant was present and participated at
the original hearing. Therefore, I find that there is little prejudice to
amending the order to correct the clerical error in the Tenant’s first name
only. The amendments are bolded in this order and no other amendments are made.
 
Pinedale Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Trevor Melward Malcolm, Michelle Pascal
and Serena Allie
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on September 22, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Gail Kukor Lang, the
Tenant, Trevor Melward Malcolm (‘TMM’), and TMM’s Representative, C.
Williams, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June
25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $2,039.00.
 
4.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,039.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TSL-22778-21-AM
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from June 1, 2021 to
June 25, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
7.     The parties agree that the amount outstanding to September 30, 2021, inclusive of rent
arrears ($28,723.91), and costs ($186.00), is $28,909.91.
 
Section 83
 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a repayment agreement with
the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until October 31, 2021 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
9.    
TMM proposed to pay an
additional $1,000.00 on top of the monthly
rent for 12 months.
TMM proposed pay the remaining balance
in a lump sum payment
at the end of the 12- month period.
 
10.  While the Landlord was not opposed to a 12-month
payment plan, the Landlord’s Legal Representative expressed concern about
how the Tenant would pay the lump sum at the
end of the 12-month period. I share that concern.
 
11.  TMM testified that he was in a car accident and is
currently receiving $3,800.00 monthly from disability benefits.
The tenancy began
June 2020 and the Tenants
paid first and last
month’s rent when they moved in. Since then no payments were made to the Landlord.
It was unclear how the lump sum payment would be made. Given all the
circumstances, I am not satisfied that the Tenants’ proposal is reasonable.
 
12.  However, I am also mindful
that the TMM has a child living with him that will be affected by this order. Therefore, postponing
the eviction will allow TMM some time to void the order as set out below or
arrange for alternate housing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
October 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $26,640.50*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to September
29, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$67.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting September 30,
2021 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.




File Number: TSL-22778-21-AM
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before October
31, 2021, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from November 1,
2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before October 31, 2021, then starting November
1, 2021, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 1, 2021.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$28,909.91 if the payment
is made on or before
September 30, 2021, or
ii)             
$30,948.91 if the payment is made on or before
October 31, 2021**.
If the Tenants
do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after November 1, 2021 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
