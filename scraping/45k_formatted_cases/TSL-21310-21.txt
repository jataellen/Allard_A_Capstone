In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 58 LYNNFORD DRIVE ETOBICOKE ON M9B1H9


 




Between:


Arisara Sahota Renata Walecki


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Shafikul
Bashar


Tenant



 
 
 
Arisara Sahota
and Renata Walecki
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Shafikul Bashar (the 'Tenant') because they intend to convert the rental
unit to a non- residential use. The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 30, 2021.
 
The Landlord
Arisara Sahota, the Landlord Representative J. O’Malley, the Tenant and the
Tenant Representative C. Sa’d attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The
Landlord served the Tenants with a Form N13 seeking termination of the tenancy
for the purpose of converting the rental unit to a non-residential use, in
accordance with section 50(1)(c) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
“Act”).  The Form N13 was served upon
the Tenant on November 5, 2020.
 
2.    
As a
preliminary matter, the issue of non-payment by the Landlords to the Tenant of
one month’s compensation was raised. Section 52(2) of the Act provides
that the “landlord shall compensate a tenant in an amount equal to one
month’s rent…” when the landlord serves a form N13 for the purpose of
converting the rental unit or the residential complex to a non-residential use. Section 55.1 of the Act further
requires that compensation under section 52 shall be paid to the
tenant no later
than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination.




File Number: TSL-21310-21
 
3.    
The
termination date set out in the Form N12 is March 31, 2021. The Landlord admits that compensation was
not paid prior to the termination date but added there were two uncashed rent
cheques for October 2021 and November 2021.
 
4.     I would be prepared to accept that a rent
credit may satisfy the requirement of one month’s worth of compensation under
the Act, if the rent abatement was for a period of time prior to the
termination date set out in the Form N13; and, the Landlords communicated prior
to the termination date in the notice of termination their intention to provide
a rent abatement in satisfaction of the one month’s compensation requirement.
This was not done here.
 
5.    
Since
the Landlords did not provide the required one month’s compensation to the Tenant on or before the termination date
in the Form N13, the Landlord’s application fails for lack of required
compensation.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed, without prejudice.
