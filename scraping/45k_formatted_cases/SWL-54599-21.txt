Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54599-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


96, 1095 JALNA BOULEVARD LONDON ON N6E2Y7


 




Between:


Steve Richardson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Melissa
Macaulay


Tenant



 
 
 
Steve Richardson (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Melissa Macaulay (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard
by videoconference on December
20, 2021. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 5, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,100.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$9,386.00, which represents the arrears of rent
($9,200.00), and costs ($186.00) outstanding for the period ending December 31,
2021.

2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied
on the condition that:
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $1,000.00 to the Landlord
on or before the 20th of each
month commencing on January 20, 2022, up to and including June 20, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $2,000.00
to the Landlord on or before February
28, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall pay $1,386.00 to the Landlord
on or before July 20, 2022.
 
•        
The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months
of January 2022 up to and
including July 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each corresponding
month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)   The Landlord may apply under section 78 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment of any new arrears of
rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph 1 of this order. The
Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition
set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)   The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the
post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
