Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24545-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


16, 7720 DORCHESTER ROAD NIAGARA FALLS ON L2G5W2


 




Between:


Anthony Di Giacomo


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Grace Anger


Tenant



 
Anthony Di
Giacomo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Grace Anger (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord
intends to do major repairs
or renovations to the
rental unit.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 5, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agent Raeann Hedge,
the Tenant and the Tenant’s
Representative, Lisa Ridille attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The
Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacated in order to do major repairs or
renovations to the rental unit which entails opening walls and floors to find a
leak. The Landlord has not obtained the necessary permits for this work. The
Landlord has not taken all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary permits for
this work as there’s no dispute he has not applied.
I am also not satisfied
that it is not possible
for the Landlord to obtain the
permits until the rental unit is vacant.
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    The application is dismissed.
