Between:


Cambridge Non-profit Housing Corp.

and


 




 


Lisa Wight


Tenant



 
 
 
Cambridge Non-profit Housing
Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Lisa Wight (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on November 22, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Eric Schroeder, and the Landlord’s Agent, Cathy Shafe,
attended the hearing. As of 1 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served
the Tenant an N5 notice
of termination alleging
the following:
 
a)    
On May 25, 2020, the Tenant
vandalized another tenant’s unit patio, door, chairs, and windows. On May 26,
2020, the Tenant admitted to an employee of the landlord that she was responsible for vandalizing the other tenant’s
rental unit. The Landlord incurred costs of $284.08 to
repair the damage.
 
b)    
On June 24, 2020, multiple witnesses
reported to the Landlord that the Tenant was
screaming vulgarities and being verbally abusive to an employee of the Landlord
and another tenant of the residential complex.
 
2.     The Tenant did not void the N5 notice and the Landlord
brings this application to the Board.

3.    
On any application before the
Board, the person who alleges any particular incident or event occurred
has the burden
of leading sufficient evidence to establish
that it is more likely than
not that their version of events is true. In this case that burden falls on the
Landlord. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the Landlord has
led insufficient evidence to prove the allegations in the N5.
 
4.     The Landlord did not call any witnesses who had personal
knowledge of the allegations in the N5. For example, the Landlord
alleges that the Tenant admitted to an employee, that she vandalized the other
tenant’s unit. However, that employee was not present to testify at the
hearing. The Landlord submitted an email from the employee wherein it states
that the Tenant told him she vandalized the other tenant’s unit. However, this
evidence is double hearsay and I give it virtually no weight. Similarly, the
Landlord did not call any witnesses who had witnessed the incident on June 24,
2020.
 
5.    
Since the Landlord failed
to prove the allegations in the N5, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
6.     I want to make it clear to the Tenant that my decision
should not be misunderstood as protection for the Tenant from the consequences
of any future breaches of the Act, including
the consequences of eviction. Had the Landlord
adduced sufficient evidence
in this case, this may have resulted in a very different outcome.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
