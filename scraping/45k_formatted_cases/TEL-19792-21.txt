Joshua Onate and Wei Shiuan Chen
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Richard
Gaskin (the 'Tenant')
because the Landlord
requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 25, 2022.
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
2.       
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent on October
28, 2021.
 
3.       
The Landlords served the Tenant with an N12 Notice to terminate the Tenancy because the Landlord Requires the Unit on
September 29, 2021 with a termination date of November 30, 2021.
 
4.       
At the hearing, the Landlord, J.O. testified that he used to work out of town but since his position has been transitioned to
working remotely, he has been staying in his parents’ basement while he waits
to get vacant possession of his unit.
 
5.       
At the hearing the Landlord W. C. testified that she is currently residing
in her parents’ basement while she waits to move in with her boyfriend
J. O.




 
6.       
The Tenant testified that he does not question
the good faith
of the Landlords and he believes they will move into their
unit.
 
7.       
The Tenant testified that he is simply looking
for more time to
find a place to live because
he often works long hours and doesn’t have a lot of time to look for a place.
 
8.       
The Landlords provided evidence
that they have been sending
the Tenant several
listings of available units in the area. The Landlords testified that the Tenant would constantly make
excuses for why the available units were not acceptable for him.
 
9.       
At the hearing, the Landlords said that they would be willing to allow the Tenant until the end of
March 2022.
 
10.   I find on a
balance of probabilities, that the Landlords in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupancy for
a minimum of twelve months.
 
11.  
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until March 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
