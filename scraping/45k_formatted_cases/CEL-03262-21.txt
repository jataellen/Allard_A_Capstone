Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03262-21



In the matter
of:


1404, 2185
SHERIDAN PARK DRIVE MISSISSAUGA ON L5K1C7


 




Between:


IMH Pool
VIII


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Shakeem Singh


 
Tenant



 
 
IMH Pool VIII (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Shakeem Singh (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by video
conference on February 7, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Matt Anderson, attended the hearing. As of 10:24 a.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to February
28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective October 2, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent as of January 1, 2022 is $1,882.32.
4.    
The Tenant paid $5,991.82 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,860.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit has been paid to the Tenant
up to December 31, 2020.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
March 5, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,866.04*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 22, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $61.88
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 5, 2022, then starting
March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 6, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)  
$5,389.93 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022,
or
ii)  
$7,272.25 if the payment is made on or before
March 5, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after March
6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
