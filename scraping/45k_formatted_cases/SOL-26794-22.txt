$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 1, 2022, then starting
February 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
