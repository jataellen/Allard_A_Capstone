Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


5 RENFREW AVENUE CHATHAM ON N7M4E4


 




Between:


Frank Whitmarsh (POA)


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lisa Kellier
  Sol Kellier


Tenants



 
 
 
Frank Whitmarsh (POA) (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Sol Kellier and Lisa Kellier (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Audrey Skinner, and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective October 11, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on
the date this application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $950.00.
 
4.     The Tenants made no payments
after the application was filed.
 
5.     The parties appeared before the Board previously
regarding an application based on a notice to terminate for purchaser’s own use
contained in Board file SWL-52347-21. In order SWL-52347-21 issued October 4,
2021, the Landlord was awarded daily compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit beyond June 30, 2021, the termination date in the notice of
termination for purchaser’s own use.
 
6.    
The Court
Enforcement Office returned
possession to the Landlord
pursuant to the previous order on December 16, 2021.




File Number: SWL-55758-21
 
7.    
As the Landlord already holds an
order for daily compensation for the
period starting July 1, 2021, the only rent arrears
outstanding that the Board has jurisdiction to award are with
respect to the period February 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.
 
8.     The arrears of rent owing for the period February
1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 total
$4,750.00. An order shall
issue requiring the Tenants to pay that amount to the Landlord.
 
9.    
The Landlord
incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
10. 
As the Tenants are no longer
in possession and the tenancy
has already terminated, no eviction order shall issue.
 
11.  The Landlord requests
that the Board issue an order that includes pre-judgement
interest for the period starting December 17, 2021, which is the day possession
of the unit was returned to the Landlord. The Board does not have jurisdiction
to order pre-judgement interest so the Landlord’s request is denied. Pursuant
to s. 206(7) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) the Board’s jurisdiction with respect to interest is restricted
to post-judgement interest only.
 
12. 
This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$4,750.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing for the period February 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do
not pay the Landlord the full amount owing
on or before February 11, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
