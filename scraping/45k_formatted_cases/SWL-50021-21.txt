Aidan Carter -
Care of Dorene - Moffatt Property Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Sue Jubenville (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 15, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Audrey Skininer,
attended the hearing. As of 3:26 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice
of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from January 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 26, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
May 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $725.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of May 31, 2021,
the date the Tenant returned vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
