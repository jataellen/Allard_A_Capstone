File Number: CEL-02814-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


14 CHELTENHAM ROAD BARRIE ON L4M6T2


 




Between:


C/O Gurukirpa Legal
  Services


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jada Reaney
  Ryan Cabral


Tenants



 
 
 
C/O Gurukirpa
Legal Services (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Jada Reaney and Ryan
Cabral (the 'Tenants') because they, another
occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently
caused undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied
for an order requiring the Tenants
to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 6,
2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Manmohan
Rekhi, Landlord and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
For the reasons that
follow, I find that the notice to terminate the tenancy because the Tenants, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential
complex have wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises is fatally
flawed, and therefore, not valid. Since the notice is not valid, the Landlord’s
application cannot be granted.
 
2.   
I raised as a preliminary issue that the N5 noted in the details
section to “see Schedule A” but there was no schedule attached to
it.
 
3.   
The Landlord's Legal Representative submitted that he was sure it would have been
attached.
 
4.    The Tenants testified that their copy did not have a schedule attached
to it.




File Number: CEL-02814-21
 
5.   
Based on the Tenants’
testimony and the fact that the Board
does not have the schedule, I find on a balance of probabilities that the N5 notice did not have the “Schedule
A” attached to it, as such
there were no particulars in the notice.
 
6.   
In Ball v. Metro
Capital Property, [2002] O.J. No. 5931, the court held that notices of
termination must contain
specific details as to the behaviour complained of including dates and times of that behaviour.
 
7.   
Therefore, based on
all of the above, as the Tenants did not know the case they had to meet, the Landlord’s application must be dismissed. Receiving the Landlord’s disclosure just prior to the hearing does
not meet the test in Ball.
 
8.   
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlord's application is dismissed without prejudice.
