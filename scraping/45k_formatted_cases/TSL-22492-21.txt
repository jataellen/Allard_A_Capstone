Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-22492-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


801, 1011 LANSDOWNE AVENUE TORONTO ON M6H4G1


 




Between:


LPM Management


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 


Tenant




 


Raymond
Terrell


 



 
 
 
 
LPM Management (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Raymond Terrell (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. The Landlord's Legal Representative, Allistair
Trent, the Tenant
and the Tenant’s Support Worker
J. Chan Epic attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2021
to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 26, 2021.
 
2.   
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.   
The lawful
monthly rent is $820.82.
 
4.   
The Tenant paid $5,704.10 after the application was filed.
 
5.   
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
6.   
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant to subsection
83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The payments will be made on behalf of the
Tenant by an eviction prevention program in the community.

It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,858.43, which represents the arrears of rent
$1,672.43, and costs $186.00
outstanding for the period ending December 31, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord’s application for eviction
of the Tenant is denied

of the monies owing under

The Tenant
shall pay arrears

of $1,858.43 on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
The Tenant
shall also pay the Landlord
the rent for the months of January 2022 and
February 2022 in full, on or before the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails
to make any of the payments in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord
may apply under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance
owing under paragraph
1 of this order shall become payable
on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing
shall bear interest
at the post- judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7)
of the Act.
