In the matter
of:


14, 827 THIRD STREET MISSISSAUGA ON L5E1B8


 




Between:


Myron Ruzycky


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Oshea
Richards


Tenant



 
 
 
Myron Ruzycky
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Oshea
Richards (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes (L1 application) and because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent (L2 application).
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on October 14, 2021. The Landlord’s
Agent and son Daniel Ruzycky and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant raised
the following issues
pursuant to section
82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'):
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 16, 2021.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,220.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 29, 2016 to April 16, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant
paid $7,444.45 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The parties
agree as of the date of the hearing that the Tenant
owes to the Landlord
$1,726.55 which
includes $1,525.55 in rent arrears
owing and $201.00
for the costs
of filing the application.




 
 
 
 
L2 application:
 
6.    
The Landlord’s L2 application is based on an N8 notice served to the Tenant on April 1,
2021 with a termination date of May 31, 2021.
 
7.    
The N8 notice alleges
that the Tenant has failed to pay the monthly rent in full and on time each month from February 2020 to March 2021. The Tenant does not dispute
the contents of the N8 notice.
 
8.    
The parties agreed that
since serving the N8 notice, the Tenant had failed to pay their monthly rent on time for the months of April, June, July, August,
September, and October 2021.
 
Section 82:
 
9.    
Section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
Act) states in part:
 
82 (1) At a hearing of an application by
a landlord under section 69 for an order terminating a tenancy and evicting a
tenant based on a notice of termination under
section 59, the Board shall permit the tenant to raise any issue that could
be the subject of an application made by the tenant under this Act.
 
Harassment:
 
10.  The Tenant testified that on June 24, 2021 the Landlord’s Agent was at the neighbouring resident’s unit doing an
inspection and began to shout and yell offensive comments towards the Tenant. The Tenant was working from home that day
and was on break during the incident. The
Landlord’s Agent denied the incident. The Tenant
did not have any audio recordings,
sworn statements or testimony from the neighbouring resident to support these
allegations. The Tenant seeks 1
months rent abatement for this harassment.
 
Damage to vehicle:
 
11.  The Tenant testified that the Landlord has
wilfully been damaging his vehicle parked in the parking lot of the residential
complex. The Tenant submitted into
evidence multiple videos of a security camera
installed by the Tenant (TT exhibit #2). The security
camera footage shows the Landlord’s agent and other residents walking by
the Tenant’s vehicle on multiple days, but none of the footage shows either the
Landlord’s Agent or the other
residents wilfully damaging the Tenant’s vehicle. The Landlord’s Agent disputes the
Tenant’s allegations and argues that the Tenant’s
vehicle is old and that the damage to it has occurred over time outside of the
residential complex. On cross
examination, the Tenant confirmed that he has no Police reports regarding any
damage to his vehicle.
The Tenant
is seeking approximately $8,000.00 in damages
to his vehicle.




 
 
 
 
 
No hot water:
 
12.  On August 1, 2021 the Tenant had no hot
water in the bathroom of his rental unit. On
this date, the Tenant dropped off a letter to the Landlord in the mail drop box
located in the front lobby of the residential complex.
The Tenant testified
that the Landlord
monitors this drop box daily as this is where the rent cheques are
dropped off.
 
13.  On August 9, 2021 the Tenant testified that
he had heard no response from the Landlord and as such, called a private
plumber and contractor to service the shower faucet. The Tenant had to pay $265.55 in out of pocket expenses to have
the shower faucet replaced. The Tenant submitted into evidence a copy of the invoice
paid to the contractor
(TT exhibit #2). The Tenant seeks
reimbursement for this out of pocket expense.
 
14.  The Landlord argues that the Tenant was
never authorized to do the repairs himself or seek the services of a
third-party contactor. The Landlord’s
Agent testified that the Tenant did not directly contact him regarding the hot
water issue in his bathroom and as such, the Landlord was unable to respond on
such a short period of time. The
Landlord argues that the Tenant should not be granted reimbursement of the
August 9, 2021 invoice because the Tenant did not provide
the Landlord with enough time to remedy
the situation.
 
Analysis:
 
15.  Based on the evidence before
the Board, I am not satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the
Landlord harassed the Tenant on June 24, 2021 by shouting and yelling
offensive comments
from another resident’s balcony. The Landlord’s Agent disputed the Tenant’s claim and the Tenant further
did not provide any evidence to support this allegation. The Tenant provided no audio recordings of the incident and
further did not have the neighbouring resident present to testify regarding the
incident.
 
16.  Based on the evidence before
the Board, I am not satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the Landlord,
the Landlord’s Agent or that another resident has wilfully
damaged or vandalized the Tenant’s vehicle. The
video evidence provided by the Tenant shows individuals walking by the Tenant’s
vehicle, but none of the videos show any of these individuals vandalizing or
damaging the Tenant’s vehicle.
 
17.  Based on the evidence before
the Board, I am satisfied
that the Tenant
has incurred and should be credited for out of pocket
expenses in the amount of $265.55. The
Landlord did not dispute that the Tenant dropped off a letter in the Landlord’s
drop box regarding the service required to the bathroom faucet. Although the Landlord
did not authorize the Tenant to outsource
the work for the repairs,
I find that the Landlord
would have incurred out of pocket expenses to do the
work themselves. I also accept the Tenant’s evidence
that the Landlord did not respond
to the Tenant’s letter dated August 1,2021 on or before
August 9, 2021 when the repairs were completed. As such, the amount owing to the




 
Landlord shall be deducted
by $265.55 in consideration of the Tenant’s
out of pocket expenses.
 
Relief from eviction:
 
18.  For the L1 application the Landlord is
seeking a standard voidable termination order in which the Tenant would be
required to pay the outstanding rent arrears and filing fee within 11 days of
the date of the order to avoid termination of Tenancy. For the L2 application the Landlord
is seeking an order for the Tenant to
pay the rent in full and on time going forward should the L1
portion of this application be voided.
 
19.  The Tenant is seeking a 12-month payment
plan for the rent arrears owing on the L1 application and a conditional order for the L2 application requiring the Tenant to pay the
monthly rent in full and on time going forward.
 
20. 
I have
considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and
find that for the L1 application, it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. For
the L2 application, I find that find that it would not be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
21. 
The
Tenant did not provide the Board with any evidence regarding his personal
circumstances, reasons why he fell into arrears
of rent or why such an extended
payment plan was warranted. Based
on the evidence before the Board, I find that a 12-month payment plan would be
unfair to the Landlord. I do find
however that it would be fair to allow the Tenant some additional time to pay
the rent arrears owing and to preserve the Tenancy should the L1 portion of the
order be voided.
 
 
It is
ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $2,995.91*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and
less the amount of the abatement the
Landlord owes the Tenant.




 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$42.25 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,316.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. The Landlord shall deduct from this total any additional payments the Tenant
made from October
12, 2021.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
The Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent:
 
10.  If the Tenant voids the part of this order relating to non-payment of rent, above, the
Tenant shall:
 
a)  
Pay the lawful monthly
rent for February
2022 on or before February
15, 2022.
 
b)  
Pay lawful
monthly rent as it comes due in full and no later than the first day of each month commencing March 2022 through
to February 2023.
 
11.  If the Tenant
fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 10 of
this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant and within 30 days
of the breach, apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
