Order under Section 31
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CET-87428-19
CET-84785-19
 
 
 
 
 
SS and MRH (the 'Tenants')
applied for an order determining that RL (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed,
coerced, threatened or interfered with them
and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a
member of their household.
 
The Tenants
also applied for an order determining that the Landlord
failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or
maintenance standards.
 
The hearing
was held de novo via videoconference on February 24, 2022.
 
Only the Tenants Legal Representative RH attended the hearing. As of 9:15 a.m.,
the tenants and the Landlord were not present, and the Landlord was not
represented at the hearing although properly notified of this hearing by the
Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants legal representative indicated that he had been seeking
instructions from his client in advance of the hearing and
that he had no instructions for this hearing.
The matter was stood down so that the Tenant could be contacted
to provide instructions or to join the
hearing. When the hearing reconvened,
the Tenant was not present, and the legal representative indicated that he had
not been able to reach his client.
 
2.     I noted that although this application was being heard
de novo, the prior directions and orders of the Board remained
in effect, and that there had been 3 prior adjournments and that the adjournments had been
peremptory on the Tenant.




File Number: CET-87428-19

3.    
Since the Tenants did not appear
at the de novo hearing
to support their application, and noting that the legal representative
had no instructions, I find that this application has been abandoned.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenants' applications are dismissed.
