In the matter
of:


15, 295 MAIN STREET E NORTH BAY ON P1B1B2


 




Between:

On February 2, 2022, John Miller
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Paula Cooper (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on January
20, 2022 with respect to application NOL-43299-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $657.75 rent on
or before February 1, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order NOL-43299-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 5, 2022.
 
3.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant: $21.62 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 23, 2022 to the date
the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay any amounts
that become owing as a result of this
order.




File Number: NOL-44707-22
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 5, 2022, then starting March 6, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 6, 2022.
