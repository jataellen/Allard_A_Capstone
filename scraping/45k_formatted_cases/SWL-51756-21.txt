Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
SWL-51756-21




 
In the matter
  of:


 
UPPER APT, 1407
LINCOLN ROAD N WINDSOR ON N8Y2J2


 




Between:


Andrew Lawrance


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Haggerty


Tenant



 
 
 
Andrew Lawrance (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Haggerty (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
This
application was heard by videoconference on August 19, 2021 and November 5,
2021. The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing on August 19, 2021. The Tenant spoke with
Duty Counsel prior to the
hearing. The hearing was adjourned as additional time was required
to complete the hearing.
 
At the return of the hearing
on November 5, 2021, the Landlord attended
the hearing. As of 1:17
p.m the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of the hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 16,
2021.
 
2.       
I find the Tenant vacated the
rental unit on September 11, 2021, based on the uncontested evidence
of the Landlord that he watched the Tenant move out on this date. The Tenant was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.       
The monthly rent is $636.00.
 
4.       
The Tenant paid $1,507.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.       
The Landlord is not holding a rent deposit.




File Number: SWL-51756-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.

11, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $929.93*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to September 11, 2021.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
