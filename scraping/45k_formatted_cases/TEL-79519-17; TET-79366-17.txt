Order under Section 31 and 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79519-17
TET-79366-17
 










 
 
 

M.P.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.C.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  This
is an L1 application (TEL-79519-17).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because he, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a
residential complex that has three or fewer residential units.  This is an
L2 application (TEL-79519-17).
 
The
Tenant applied for an order determining that the
Landlord harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant, entered the rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or
by a member of the Tenant's household.  This is a T2 application
(TET-79366-17).
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on May 9, 2017.  The
Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Evidence:
 
1.   
The Tenant gave the following evidence in relation to application
TET-79366-17.  He moved into the rental unit September 1, 2017 with his nine
year old son.  He lives in the basement of the house and the Landlord lives on
the upper level.  There is no door separating the units. When you enter the
side door of the house there is a landing.  To go to his unit you would go down
ten steps and to go to the Landlord’s unit you would go up four steps.  He does
not share a washroom or kitchen facility with the Landlord but they did share
the washing machine.


2.    In order for
the Landlord to use the washing machine she would have to come into his portion
of the complex.  He did not understand that there was no dryer and that the
Landlord would be wandering through his unit to hang clothes at the rear of the
unit.  Once he realized this was a problem he spoke to the Landlord and she
ignored his requests to provide notice of her intention to enter his unit. She
refused to comply and provide written notice.  Finally on March 21, 2017 he
called the Police and advised them the Landlord was illegally entering his
unit.  She finally stopped coming into his unit at that time and she has not
entered since.


3.    The Landlord
gave the following evidence in relation to application TET-79366-17.  At the
onset of the tenancy there was an agreement that she could enter the unit when
she needed to do her laundry.  As the washing machine was at the bottom of the
stairs she felt this agreement allowed her to enter the unit when she needed
without having to advise the Tenant in advance.  The Tenant knew there was no
dryer and knew that she had to access the rear area of his unit to hang her
clothes to dry.  She has not entered the unit since December 2016.


4.    The Police were
called to the complex on March 21, 2017.  However, that alleged illegal entry
was in relation to an issue with the furnace.  It had broken down and she had
to enter the unit to have the furnace repaired.


5.    The Landlord
gave the following evidence in relation to the L1 portion of application
TEL-79519-17.  The Tenant only paid a portion of the rent in December 2016.  He
paid all of the rent in January and February 2017 but has not paid any rent
since that time.  The rent for March, 2017, April 2017 and May 2017 is
outstanding.  There is also a portion of the rent for December 2016
outstanding.  There is no rent deposit.


6.    The Landlord
gave the following evidence in relation to the L2 portion of application
TEL-79519-17.  The Tenant smokes marijuana in the rental unit.  The Tenant also
burns incense in the unit in an attempt to mask the smell of the marijuana. 
She is allergic to smoke and has asked the Tenant to smoke the marijuana
outside.  The Tenant complied for a short period of time but he is now smoking
in the unit again.  This action causes her breathing issues.  She has a
grandchild who has asthma and the smoke also disturbs that child when visiting.


7.    The Tenant gave
the following evidence in relation to the L1 application.  His source of income
is the Ontario Disability Support Program.  He suffers from many disabilities. 
He owes rent for April 2017 and May 2017.  He always pays rent by cash and the
Landlord did not give him receipts.  He does not owe rent for December 2016 or
March 2017.


8.   
The Tenant gave the following evidence in relation to the L2
application.  He does smoke marijuana.  He has a medical prescription for the
marijuana due to several medical conditions.  At first he smoked outside but
the neighbours complained.  He did not want issues for the Landlord so he stopped
smoking outside.  While he understands that the smell of the marijuana may
disturb the Landlord he has attempted to minimize the smell by burning
incense.  He does not believe the Landlord is allergic to smoke.  This belief
is founded by the fact the Landlord is a smoker.  She has been seen many times
smoking outside at the complex.
 
Determinations/reasons:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for
the period from December 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 7, 2017.
2.    
The Landlord has illegally entered the rental unit and seriously
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by the Tenant and
his son.  Despite the fact there may have been an agreement for the Landlord to
use the washing machine there was no proof provided that shows the Landlord was
permitted to enter the unit without permission or first giving the Tenant
written notice of her intention to enter the unit.  There was also never any
agreement that the Landlord would wander through the Tenant’s unit after she
had washed her laundry.  If the Landlord wants to use the washing machine she
should first ask the Tenant for permission to enter the unit or provide the
Tenant with the required notice as per the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. 

3.    
Based on application TET-79366-17 the Tenant is entitled to an
abatement of rent of $1,620.00.  This amount has been calculated as twenty
percent of the monthly rent for the period of September 2016 to February 2017. 
Six months at $270.00 per month.  The Tenant believes that the last time the
Landlord entered the unit was late February 2017.
4.    
In relation to the L1 application I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until June 15, 2017 pursuant to subsection
83(1)(b) of the Act.  This amount of time has been given to accommodate the
disabilities of the Tenant and to allow him to speak with his worker in an
attempt to secure the funding to pay the arrears of rent or in the alternative
find alternate suitable living accommodations.
5.    
The L2 application is dismissed.  The Tenant has disabilities with
require him to smoke prescribed marijuana.  The Landlord has a duty to
accommodate the Tenant’s disabilities to the point of undue hardship.  If he
needs to smoke the marijuana and it is prescribed the Landlord must allow this
to take place.  The fact the smell bothers her does not, in my opinion,
constitute undue hardship.
6.    
The Landlord stated she is allergic to smoke.  If I believed that
she was I could find the smoke was an undue hardship and that she could pursue
termination of the tenancy based on this issue.  However, the fact that she is
a smoker causes me to have concerns with her claim to be allergic to smoke.
7.    
The reasons contained in this order constitute all of the reasons
used to make my decision. 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Based on the L1 application unless the Tenant voids the order as
set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 15, 2017.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,955.22*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to May 10, 2017 and less the
amount of the abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation
for the use of the unit starting May 11, 2017 to the date he moves out of the
unit.
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before June 15, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from June 16, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
5.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before June 15, 2017, then
starting June 16, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
June 16, 2017.
7.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy,
he must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $2,880.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2017, or
ii)      $4,230.00 if the payment is made on or before June 15, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after June 16, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
9.    
The L2 application is dismissed.
