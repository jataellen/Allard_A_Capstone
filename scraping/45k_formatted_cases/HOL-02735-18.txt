Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-02735-18
 











 
 

J.R (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict J.B (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on May 28, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing. The Tenant consulted with Tenant Duty Counsel prior to
the hearing. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective April 24, 2018.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession
of the rental unit. 
 
3.     
The monthly rent as of the
date of the hearing is $2,100.00.      
 
4.     
The Tenant has made no
payments since the application was filed.  
 
5.     
At the hearing the Tenant
did not dispute the amounts of rent charged by the Landlord or the amounts of
rent paid by the Tenant during the material time. The total owed by the Tenant
as of the date of the hearing is $6,400.00
 
6.     
At the hearing the Tenant
submitted that she wished to raise issues under s. 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). The Tenant submitted that the
Landlord had harassed the Tenant in various ways. Order TST-90157-17, issued
May 2, 2018, resolved an application filed by the Tenant in which she alleged
harassment and substantial interference by the Landlord. I refused to hear any issues that were or could
have been raised in the hearing of application TST-90157-17, as these issues would be barred by the
doctrine of res judicata. At
the hearing of this application, I asked the Tenant if she wished to raise any
issues that she had not raised or could not have raised in application
TST-90157-17 (in other words, any new issues) and she responded that she did
not. As the Tenant raised no new
issues, I did not hear or consider
any issues under s.82 of the Act.
 
7.     
At the hearing the Tenant
submitted that the N4 notice of termination (‘N4 notice’) served on her by the
Landlord was invalid for two reasons: (a) the Tenant’s name is misspelled, and
(b) the Landlord served the N4 notice on the same day that the Landlord’s
previous L1 application (HOL-02468-18) was heard (at that hearing the
Landlord’s application was dismissed due to a technical error).
8.     
There is no requirement in
the Act that an N4 notice have the tenant’s name on it. The N4 notice served by
the Landlord is therefore not invalid because the Tenant’s name was misspelled.
In any event, the Tenant understood that the N4 notice was meant for her and
was in relation to her tenancy with the Landlord.
9.     
There was no legal
impediment to the Landlord serving the Tenant with a fresh N4 notice on the
same date as the hearing of HOL-02468-18, and so I cannot find that the N4
notice is invalid for this reason.
10.  
I therefore find that the N4
notice is valid.
 
Section 83
11.  
At the hearing the Tenant
submitted that the Landlord’s harassment of the Tenant caused the Tenant to
fall into arrears. Later in the hearing the Tenant testified that she fell into
arrears because, due to some permanent injuries, she has a very limited ability
to earn income. The Tenant receives a small pension and earns a small amount of
income from self-employment. The Tenant testified that she has attempted, for
years, to obtain disability benefits from various sources but she has been
denied. The Tenant testified that she is still attempting to obtain disability
benefits through various means, including at least one lawsuit. The Tenant
testified that she has been disabled since 1999. 
12.  
This tenancy began in
October 2016. The Tenant’s inability to earn a sufficient income to pay her
rent pre-dates the tenancy by several years. The Tenant’s arrears cannot be
attributed to any actions of the Landlord. Further, the Tenant’s disability is
not an unexpected event that suddenly made it difficult to meet her
obligations. 
13.  
The Tenant testified that
she expects to receive a lump sum payment of $4,491.07 from an estate by June
21, 2018. This amount would only cover approximately half of the amount owing
to that date, leaving a balance of over $4,100.00. The Tenant proposed to pay
this in instalments of $500.00 per month, but she was unable to answer in any
certain or precise way how she would also pay her rent. At the hearing I found
the Tenant’s proposed payment plan to be unrealistic and so I do not believe it
would be appropriate to make a conditional order.
14.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until June 21, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenant
expects to receive a lump sum on that date. An extension of time gives the
Tenant time to make arrangements for the payment of the remainder.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before June 21,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $6,342.43*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 30, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $69.04 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 21, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 22,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 21, 2018, then starting June 22, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 22, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $6,575.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $8,675.00 if the payment is made on or before June 21, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 22, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
