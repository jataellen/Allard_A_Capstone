Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-42903-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


994 HOLT PLACE THUNDER BAY ON P7E3K1


 




Between:


North44 Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Krista Maxwell
  Ryan Maxwell


Tenants



 
 
 
North44 Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ryan Maxwell and Krista Maxwell (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on August 5, 2021. Only
the Landlord's Legal Representative, Samantha Ramkissoon attended the hearing.
As of 12:21 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,399.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $900.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act. The Tenants did not attend the hearing to present evidence or
submissions in support of granting relief from eviction and no circumstances
were disclosed at the hearing or appeared in the Board file.




 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 4, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$10,270.05*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $45.99
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or
before February 4, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 5,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 4, 2022, then starting
February 5, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 5, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
 
i)                   
$12,076.00 if the payment
is made on or before January 31, 2022,
or
ii)                 
$13,475.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 4, 2022**.
 
 
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this
paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 5, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
