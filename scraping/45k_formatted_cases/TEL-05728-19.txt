Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-05728-19
 











 
 
 

E. M. and J. M. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict E.S.-Y. and D. D. (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.  This is an L1
application.
 
The Landlords also applied for an order determining
whether the Tenants altered the locking system without their consent.  This
is an L8 application.
 
This application was heard in Whitby on January 10,
2020.
 
Only the Landlords and their
representative, Kevin Anderson, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Application for Non-Payment of Rent
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September
1, 2019 to January 31, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a
Notice of Termination effective September 19, 2019.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $1,525.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2019 to September 19, 2019.
4.     
The Tenants paid $1,525.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
Application for Altering the Locking System
6.     
The Tenants altered the
locking system on a door giving entry to the rental unit without the Landlords'
consent.
7.     
The Landlords incurred a
cost of $225.93 based on the invoice submitted by the Landlords at the
hearing.  This is less than the original estimate of $315.00 indicated on the
application.
It is ordered that:
 
Application for Non-Payment of Rent
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order for non-payment of rent application as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before February 1, 2020.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $3,161.27*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 21, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $50.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 22, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before February 1, 2020, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
February 2, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 1, 2020, then starting February 2, 2020, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 2, 2020.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust:
i)        $6,290.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2020, or
ii)       $7,815.00 if the payment is made on or before February 1, 2020**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 2,
2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
Application for Altering the Locking System
10.  
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $225.93 which represents the reasonable cost for changing the
locking system. 
11.  
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing in paragraph 10 of this order on or before
December 31, 1899, they will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from January 1, 1900 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
