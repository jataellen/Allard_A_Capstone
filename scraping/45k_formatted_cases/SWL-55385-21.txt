In the matter
of:


NESTOR/POULIN, 1712 CADILLAC STREET WINDSOR ON N8Y2V8


 




Between:


Ryan Deakins


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin Poulin Sharon
Nestor


Tenants



 
 
Ryan Deakins (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sharon Nestor and Kevin Poulin (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. The Landlord’s Legal
Representative, John Kulikowski, and one of the Tenants, Sharon Nestor, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $750.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants paid $600.00 after
the application was filed.
 
6.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:

2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,076.32*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
January 21, 2022.

to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00

Landlord the full amount owing*

2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.

of this order,

is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$9,236.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not
make full payment in
accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
