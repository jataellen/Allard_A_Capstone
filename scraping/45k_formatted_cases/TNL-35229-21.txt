Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-35229-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


642 HEPBURN
ROAD EAST MILTON ON L9T6Z3


 




Between:


Razi Ahmad


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alaa El Mais Ali Malil Amal
Imad Jokhdar
  Nahida
Noha Zahreddine


Tenants



 
 
 
Razi Ahmad
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Nahida, Imad Jokhdar, Alaa El Mais, Ali Malil, Noha Zahreddine and Amal
(the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 9, 2022 at 10:16 AM.
 
The Landlord
and the Tenant Alaa El Mais attended the hearing. The Tenant was represented by Joshua Makori. Safda Ali Javad provided testimony for the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     For the reasons set out below, I find that the
Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at least one year.
Therefore, the tenancy is terminated effective April 30, 2022.
 
2.     On July 13, 2021, the Landlord served
the Tenants with an N12 notice of termination
seeking termination of the tenancy for the purpose of residential occupation by
the Landlord. The termination date set out in the N12 notice is September 30,
2021.
 
3.     The Landlord paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent by an e-transfer sent on September 8, 2021.
 
Good Faith




 
4.    
The N12 was served pursuant to
section 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”). Section 48(1) requires
that, in order to be successful in this application, the Landlord must establish that at the time of the service
of the N12 Notice, she required,
in good faith, the unit for residential use for a period of at least one
year by his parents.
 
5.     In Feeney v. Noble, 1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC),
the Court held that the test of good faith is genuine intention to occupy the
premises and not the reasonableness of the Landlord’s proposal. This principle was upheld in Salter v.
Beljinac 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC) where
the Court held that the “good faith”
requirement simply means that the Landlord sincerely intends to occupy
the rental unit. The Landlord may also have additional motives for selecting a
particular rental unit, but this does not affect the good faith of the
Landlord’s notice.”
 
6.    
The Landlord submitted affidavits
by both parents with his application that they in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at
least one year. His father, Safda Ali
Javad, provided oral testimony at the hearing.
Mr Javad currently lives in Montreal in the basement of another son’s
house. He is 77 years old, and took the decision
about a year ago to try
to move to the Toronto area with his wife to be closer to his other son (the
Landlord) and daughter. He testified that he looks forward to living
independently with his wife, who has health issues, while also being close to
family. I find Mr. Javad’s testimony
forthright and credible.
 
7.     The Tenant, Alaa El Mais, provided oral testimony at
the hearing. He did not raise any
substantive challenges to the Landlord’s good faith intention. He indicated that he believes the Landlord owns other property, as he had been offered
other rental properties by the Landlord in the past. The Tenant believes that the Landlord’s
motivation for evicting him is to rent the unit at a higher rate, but had no
evidence to support this supposition. I
do not consider that the Tenant disproved the professed genuine intention of Mr.
Javad to move into the rental unit.
 
Relief from eviction
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, and find that it would not be unfair
to postpone the eviction
until April 30, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.
 
9.    
The Landlord expressed wanting
above all else certainty as to when
his parents could move from Montreal, and noted that a delay in terminating the
tenancy of two months might be agreeable. He voiced frustration that the Tenant
has had notice since July of
2021 and still not found alternate accommodation.
 
10.  The Tenant asked for a four-month delay in termination of the tenancy,
noting that he has
been trying to buy a house without
success, although he had some
difficulty showing that he had made
any offers made on properties more than a few weeks before the hearing. Mr. El
Mais and his wife are the only two people currently residing in the unit, the
other parties noted on the style of cause of this application having moved out.




 
11.  Having regard to the timelines
and expectations of the parties,
I believe end of April balances their respective interests
in a manner fair to all.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
April 30, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
April 30, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$9,270.75, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 1, 2021
to February 18, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $65.75 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 19, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.     The foregoing amounts
shall be offset
against any amounts
paid to rent for the rental
periods from October 1, 2021 until the Tenants vacate the rental unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
March 1, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 2, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or April 30, 2022, then
starting May 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2022.
