Order under Section 69
and Subsection 87(1)
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-77001-18











 




In the matter of:


 


 




 


 


 




Between:


S S P  (‘SSP’)
A R R  (‘ARR’)


Landlords




 


 


 




 


and


 




 


 


 




 


J T  (‘JT’)


Tenant




 


 


 



 
S S P and A R R (the 'Landlords') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict J T (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex:   has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlords has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to
compensate the Landlords for the damage (N5 Notice); and because the
Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation (N12 Notice). The Landlords also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.  (L2
Application)
 
The Landlords also applied for an order requiring the
Tenant to pay the rent that the Tenant owes.  (L9 Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on July
24, 2018.
 
One of the Landlords, SPP, the
Landlords’ Legal Representative, W G (‘WG’), the Tenant and the Tenant’s Legal
Representative, R G (‘RG’), attended the hearing.  D D’C (‘DDC’) and A O R
(‘AOR’) signed in as witnesses for the Lanldords but only AOR was called
forward to give witness testimony.   The parties
attempted mediation before they were called forward to the hearing.
 
Preliminary Matter
 
At the outset of the hearing, the
Landlords requested to withdraw the claims of wilful and/or negligent damage
(N5 notice) of the L2 application.  With no objection from the Tenant, I
consented to the withdrawal.
 
Testimonies and Evidence:
 
L9 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed, which was June 22,
2018.
2.     
The Landlords filed their L9
application because they claimed the Tenant did not pay the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31,
2018.
3.     
The Landlords submitted the
L9 update sheet which shows that after the filing of the L9 application, the
Tenant paid $6,400.00 to the Landlord in respect of rent amounts owing. 
Effectively, the parties agreed that up to July 31, 2018, the Tenant only owes
the Landlords the rent for July 2018 (i.e. $1,600.00).
4.     
Against the rent amount
owing, the parties agreed that $588.20 is to be paid back to the Tenant, which
represents an adjustment for the illegally increased rent the Landlords had
tried to institute and also included interest owing on the last month’s rent
deposit that the Landlords have been holding.
5.     
Before me, the Landlords
presented a personal cheque to the Tenant in the amount of $588.20.
6.     
The Tenant was able to show
the Landlords had attempted in April 2018 to raise the lawful rent from
$1,600.00 to $2,250.00 retroactively to February 2018, and from May 1, 2018 had
indicated the rent would become $2,500.00 (exhibits TT#1 and TT#2).  Further,
TT#1 evidences that the Landlords’ Agent, DDC, had refused to accept $1,600.00
in rent money on April 29, 2018 from the Tenant, as DDC told the Tenant the
rent to be paid was $2,250.00.
7.     
As well, the Tenant was able
to show that as of July 11, 2018, DDC and the Landlords were still not
depositing the Tenant’s May 2018 rent payment, neither subsequent monthly
payments due to some cheque issue the Tenant had with DDC (exhibit TT#3 – July
11/18 exchanged emails).
8.     
The Landlords also requested
the payment of the $190.00 filing fee, but the Tenant contested that request on
the basis the Landlords refused to accept the lawful rent from May 2018
onwards, and then turned around on June 27, 2018 and filed their L9
application.  Only after the filing of the application did the Landlords accept
three payments (during the July 16-20, 2018 timeframe) from the Tenant
totalling $6,400.00.
L2 Application
9.     
The affidavit of AOR was
submitted by the Landlords in accordance with the requirements of subsection
72(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
10.  
AOR is the son of the
Landlords.  With a letter of offer in support (exhibit LL#2), AOR testified
that in September 2018, he shall be attending university in Hamilton.  AOR
testified he intends to live in the rental unit for at least one year, and if
successful with his engineering studies, will most probably live in the unit
for the balance of his undergraduate years.
11.  
In cross-examination, AOR
admitted he did not bring evidence of an “acceptance letter” by him, but
reaffirmed under oath that he has accepted to go to university in Hamilton
starting in September 2018.
12.  
AOR and SSP confirmed by
their respective testimonies that they moved from Kuwait to Canada in July 2018
and are currently living in a Mississauga apartment.  SSP stated that her three
other children are to arrive in late August before the start of the new school
year.  SSP stated it was important to move into the unit ahead of time, so that
she can properly set up her family for the new school year in the rental unit.
13.  
The Landlords submitted
exhibit LL#3, which is a December 8, 2017 email to the Tenant, informing the
Tenant of the Landlords’ intention to move into the unit.  While LL#3 did not
constitute proper notice, the Landlords indicated the Tenant has known of the
Landlords’ intentions for a sufficiently long time.
14.  
The Tenant claimed there is
a lack of “good faith” in the Landlords’ application.   First, the Tenant
argued that due to the Landlords failing to institute an increase in monthly
rent, the Landlords decided to serve an N12 notice.  Second, the Tenant argued
the school year period in Kuwait is the same as in Canada, that is from September
to June, and so the Landlords wanting to move into the unit in the winter of
2018 (LL#3) flies in the face of the SPP’s testimony that she wants to set up
for school in September.
15.  
The Landlords submitted that
the academic year in Kuwait begins in April and ends in March, so their initial
emailed notice (LL#3) is in line with the Kuwaiti academic year.
16.  
The Tenant testified that
his wife went to India on May 30, 2018 for her mother’s medical condition and
impending surgery and is currently scheduled to return at the end of August. 
If the Landlords are successful with their L2 application, he requested a
termination date of mid-September 2018, so that he can coordinate a move-out
with his wife being present.
17.  
The Landlords confirmed that
the unpaid rent for July 2018 is hereby waived in respect of the compensation
they are required to pay.  As well if the Landlords are successful with their
application, they indicated they would apply the last month’s rent deposit to
the last rental period ordered. 
Analysis and Determinations:
18.  
With regard to the L2
application, I was sufficiently persuaded by the Landlords that their son, AOR,
genuinely intends to move into the rental unit for at least one year, along
with SSP and then his remaining siblings.
19.  
I also find that the
Landlords have paid the Tenant the required compensation pursuant to
subsections 48.1 and 55.1 of the Act.
20.  
The testimonies and
submissions concerning the failed attempt to raise rent illegally were, on a
balance of probabilities, a separate set of communications and circumstances. It
is evident that the December 8, 2017 email well predates any indication of a
requested rent increase, and this strongly suggests to me that the later failed
attempt has no real connection to the Landlords’ earlier stated intention to
move into the unit.  
21.  
I gave the aforementioned
determination to the parties present and having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, I find that it
would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until August 31, 2018, pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
22.  
With regard to the L9
application, it is clear that after the waiving of July 2018 rent, the balance
is zero.  However, the issue of the $190.00 filing fee still needs to be determined.
23.  
It is the normal practice of
the Board to award a landlord its cost of filing an application in any instance
when the Landlord is successful with its application.  The reason for this is found
in the relevant statutory provisions combined with the Board’s Rules of
Practice and Interpretation Guidelines.
24.  
Specifically, I refer to
sub-sections 204(2) and 74(2) of the Act, as well as to Board’s Guideline No. 3
entitled “Costs”, and Rule 27.1 of the Board’s Rules of Practice.
25.  
However, Members do have the
limited discretion granted under subsections 204(1) and 204(2) of the Act to
order that the cost of filing an application not be paid.
26.  
In this particular case, I
believe again that the conflicting testimonies about the failed attempt to
raise rent, and the Landlords’ subsequent refusal to accept the then lawful
rent, place me into a grey area where the limited discretion that Members have,
may be exercised for this case.
27.  
Given all of the testimonies
and evidence before me, I can easily find that the Landlords unilaterally refused
to accept $1,600.00 from the Tenant on April 29, 2018 in respect of rent that became
due on May 1, 2018.   While the parties provided conflicting testimonies about
past due rents, TT#3 provides the only documented evidence of two-way
communication between the parties surrounding the “rent arrears” around the
time of L9 filing.  In my view, I find it more likely than not that the
Landlords did not accept the Tenant’s May and June rent payments, which then
was followed by the Landlords filing their L9 application on June 22, 2018. 
Simply put, how can the Tenant be considered in arrears if the Landlords
refused to accept lawful rent payments from the Tenant?
28.  
Based on all this, I am
unable to find that the Tenant was clearly in arrears at the time of L9 filing,
and therefore I am electing to use my discretion under subsections 204(1) and
204(2) to deny the cost of the application in favour of the Landlords.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The tenancy between the
Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of August 31, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before August 31, 2018.
3.     
The last month’s rent
deposit currently being held by the Landlords shall be applied to the last
month’s rental period of August 1-31, 2018.
4.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $52.60 * per
day for compensation for the use of the unit from September 1, 2018 to the date
the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before August 31, 2018, then starting September 1, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords on or after September 1, 2018.
