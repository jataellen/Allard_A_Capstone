Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04590-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


14 COUGHLIN ROAD BARRIE ON L4N8S5


 




Between:


Kelly Johnson Sonia
Johnson


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Christina Castle
  John Castle


Tenants



 
 
 
Kelly Johnson
and Sonia Johnson
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict John
Castle and Christina Castle (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
