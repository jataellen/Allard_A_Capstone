  matter of:


APT 2, 804 INDIAN
ROAD TORONTO ON M6P2E5


 




Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Dillon Taylor Sarah
Palmer


Tenants



 
On January
20, 2022, 2362713
Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Dillon Taylor and Sarah Palmer (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of April 1, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before April 1, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before April 1, 2022, then starting
April 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 2, 2022.
