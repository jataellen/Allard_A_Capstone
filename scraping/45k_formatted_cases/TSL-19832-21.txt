In the
  matter of:


MAIN FLOOR, 26 HEMAN STREET TORONTO ON M8V1X5


 




Between:


Ppg Rausch
Holdings Ltd


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Wilson Matos Cala


Tenant



 
 
Ppg Rausch Holdings Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy of Wilson
Matos Cala (the 'Tenant') and evicted an unauthorized occupant.
 
This application was heard in
Passcode: 956 0593 7653# on February 15, 2022.
The Landlord Glenda Rausch, represented by Brett Lockwood, and the Tenant and his daughter Wendy Matos
Inclan, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     It is the Landlord’s position that the Tenant no longer lives in the rental unit because she has not seen him there when she attends the
property. The Landlord testified that
a neighbour called her in November 2020 to tell her there was a moving van and
the Tenant was leaving. The Landlord
believe that the Tenant’s daughter
is now living in the rental unit with her boyfriend. She also questioned the Tenant’s
daughter’s car is in the parking spot and the Tenant’s car is not there.
 
2.    
Both the Tenant and his daughter,
who have lived in the unit for 12 years, attended the hearing and testified
that they both continue to reside in the unit.
They also testified that the Tenant’s daughter
has a newer vehicle which they prefer
to keep in the parking
space for safety while parks his car on the street. The
Tenant testified that he is from Cuba and was on vacation in Cuba when the allegedly saw him moving. The Tenant continues to pay rent.
 
3.     Regarding the Tenant
not being seen at the property, the Tenant’s daughter
testified that she is a nurse
who works nights while the Tenant works days and would not be home with the
Landlord comes to the property.
 
4.     Considering the lack of evidence
that the Tenant
has vacated the rental unit, the Tenant continues to pay rent, the Tenant
and his daughter both testified at the hearing that the Tenant continues to
live in the unit, I find on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant has not
transferred the tenancy without the Landlord’s consent.
