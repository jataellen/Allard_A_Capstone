Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57382-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3, 25 AUSTIN DRIVE WATERLOO ON N2L3X9


 




Between:


Antonia And Arsenio
Piccin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Candius-lee Bartlett Eric Bartlett


Tenants



 
 
 
Antonia And Arsenio Piccin (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Eric Bartlett and Candius-lee Bartlett (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe
because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by
the Board on November 8, 2021 with respect to application SWL-49791-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did
not pay $800 arrears on or before November 15, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $1600.00 rent on or before November
1, 2021. The Tenant also did not pay
$1600.00 rent on or before December
1, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $9,961.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-49791-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $9,600.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-49791-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from November 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,600.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from October
28, 2020 to January 17, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SWL-49791-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $12,092.64*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January
17, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 18, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
28, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
 
January 17, 2022

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.




 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on July 29, 2022 if
the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
