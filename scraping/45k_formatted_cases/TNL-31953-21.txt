Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
TNL-31953-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
BASEMENT S, 207 PLEASANT AVENUE NORTH YORK ON M2M1M6


 




Between:


Patricia Salomon


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dolores Rohn


Tenant



 
 
 
Patricia Salomon (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dolores Rohn (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on July 26, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
February 6, 2021 to August 5, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective March 5,
2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,050.00
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from August 6, 2017 to March 5, 2021.
 
4.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant does not dispute the amount
of rent arrears claimed by the Landlord. The Tenant submitted that she
experienced financial hardship
due to the pandemic and consequently was unable to pay
her rent. The Tenant submitted that she would be able to vacate the rental unit
by September 26, 2021. The Tenant sought to be reimbursed $250.00 for repairs
that she claimed that she made to the rental unit. The Tenant did not provide
evidence to prove that she incurred expenses for repairing the rental unit.
There is no way for the Board to confirm that the Tenant actually incurred
these expenses.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $12,201.67*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 7, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 8, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 19, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 18, 2022, then starting February
19, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 19, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 18, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $13,347.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and
the Tenant could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 19, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
