Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55656-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


8, 307 KITCHENER ROAD CAMBRIDGE ON N3H1A7


 




Between:


Elko Properties Ltd.


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Bill Myers


Tenant



 
Elko Properties Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Bill Myers (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Lisa Nadon, attended
the hearing. As of 10:00 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     As of January
1, 2022, the monthly rent for the unit is $918.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,407.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until
February 28, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,659.06*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$30.18 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 29, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$2,918.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)         
$3,836.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make
this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
