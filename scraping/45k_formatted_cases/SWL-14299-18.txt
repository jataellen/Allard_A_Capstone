Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-14299-18
 











 

YN (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict TY and CF (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on May
2, 2018.
 
The Landlord attended
the hearing.  TY attended the hearing on behalf of both Tenants and spoke with
Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent they were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 24, 2018.
 
2.      The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit. 
 
3.      The monthly rent is $865.30.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $850.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 24, 2017 to February 24,
2018.
 
6.     
The Tenants paid $2,565.00
after the application was filed.
 
7.     
TY said that he had there
had been serious maintenance problems with the premises since the tenancy began
and the Landlord had failed to address them in spite of his frequent requests
that she do so.  He arranged to have a building inspector attend and carry out
an inspection in January 2018, but had not yet been able to obtain a report. 
 
8.     
The Landlord said that the
building inspector had contacted her and advised her that no order would be
issued as long as she carried out two repairs which she did do.  However, she
had not brought her records with her because she did not know that the Tenants
were going to raise this issue.  She said that, in fact, she had entered into
an agreement with the Tenants whereby the rent was $850.00 instead of the
original $1,000.00 per month in exchange for TY carrying out certain
maintenance issues which he had failed to do.
 
9.     
TY was not certain what
remedy he was seeking.  He wanted some time before vacating if the tenancy was
going to end and he thought he might be entitled to an abatement of rent but
did not know how much he was claiming.  He said that he had attempted to retain
legal representation before the hearing but had been unable to do so.  TY did
say that he could pay the one month arrears owing by June 30, 2018.
 
10.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until June 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.  I am satisfied that there have been some repair issues, as evidenced
by the fact that the Landlord did do some work in response to the contact with
the building department.  However, the neither party was prepared to address
those issues on the day of the hearing.  Under those circumstances, I believe
it is not unfair to the Landlord to give the Tenants some time to pay the
arrears.  The Tenants may file their own Tenant’s Application about Maintenance
and Repairs (T6) to address the maintenance issues.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 30,
2018.
 
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is
entitled to by $831.10*.
 
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenants: $27.95 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 5, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenants
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 30, 2018, then starting July 1, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2018.
 
7.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, they must pay to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust:
i)        $1,025.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $1,875.00 if the payment is made on or before June 30, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 1, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
