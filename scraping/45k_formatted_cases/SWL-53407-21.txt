The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $950.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
1, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,029.80*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 1, 2021, less the rent deposit.
