Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34343-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT UNIT, 390 BROWNDALE CRESCENT RICHMOND HILL ON L4C3J4


 




Between:


Samera Najafi Kaldareh Yousef Gholipour


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Saba Ikram


Tenant



 
 
 
Samera Najafi Kaldareh and Yousef
Gholipour (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Saba Ikram (the 'Tenant') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation. The Landlords
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
17, 2022. The Landlord,
Yousef Gholipour, represented by Ali Golabgir, and the Tenant, attended the
hearing.
 
The Tenant requested an adjournment because
her legal representative chose not to continue to represent her. The Tenant also stated that there was evidence that was not
submitted by her representative that support her believe that the Landlord has
been harassing her.
 
Board records show that the Tenant’s
evidence was submitted to the Board on February
15th, two days before the hearing. I had reviewed this evidence in
preparation for this hearing.
 
Considering
the fact the Tenant’s evidence has
been submitted and the fact the
Landlord has waited six months for this matter to be heard,
I find it would be unfair to grant the adjournment
based on the submissions from the Tenant.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord purchased
the property in July 2021. In August her served a notice that he intended to move into the home. The Landlord is separating from his wife,
has left the home they were living in, and is now living with a friend in the
basement.
 
2.     I find the Landlords in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.




 
3.    
The Landlord paid the Tenant compensation equal to one month's rent by informing the Tenant that she was not required to pay September rent.
 
4.    
The Tenant alleges that the Landlord
has been harassing
her to the extent it is affecting her health. The evidence that was submitted prior to
the hearing did not support this. I
find none of these text messages to be harassing.
 
5.     At the hearing
the Tenant requested
an opportunity to submit additional text message to support her claim. These were emailed to the Board’s hearing
site and were reviewed during the hearing. These text messages were
addressing unpaid rent, enquiring
about who else was occupying the rental unit, and questions
about a vehicle
parked outside. I find none of these additional text
messages demonstrate that the Landlord has been harassing the Tenant.
 
6.     The Tenant requested
an additional eight
months to vacate the rental
unit. The Landlord is seeking an order providing
occupancy by the end of this month.
 
7.     I have considered the fact the Landlord served the
notice on the Tenant and filed the application six months ago, in good faith
requires possession of the rental unit, and is living in someone’s basement. I have also considered the fact this decision will have an impact on the Tenant’s accommodations,
and she will be required to seek alternative housing. I will therefore delay the termination of the tenancy until
March 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords
$3,373.26, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from November 1, 2021
to February 22, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $29.59
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from February 23, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     Any payments the Tenant has made to the Landlord
during this period
shall be deducted from this amount ordered.
 
5.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing on or before
March 5, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 6, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
7.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April
1, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.




 
8.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
