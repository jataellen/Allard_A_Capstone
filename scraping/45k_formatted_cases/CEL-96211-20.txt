In the matter
of:


0204, 56 DONALD
STREET BARRIE ON L4N1E3


 




Between:


Siteline Donald
LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Victoria Hurst


Tenant



 
 
 
Siteline Donald LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Victoria Hurst (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on February
7, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative Sylwia McArthur and the Tenant's
Legal Representative Erli Bregu and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
 
At the hearing the Tenant
raised the following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'): the front door would
not lock and front door main entrance
buzzer not working.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
September 24, 2020.
 
2.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,580.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     The parties agree the Tenant
vacated the rental
unit on December
30, 2020.
 
4.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2019
to September 24, 2020.
 
5.     None of the contested issues (forged signature, N9)
were relevant because the parties eventually
agreed the arrears
outstanding is $3,346.00, which represents rent arrears of
$3,160.00 plus $186.00 for the filing
of the application.




 
Section 82 issues: Front Door not locking:
6.     The Tenant testified that since April 2020 until the
vacate date of December 30, 2020, they could not lock their front door to the
rental unit. She testified that she had emailed 2 people whom she believed
where employees of the Landlord
advising them of the locking situation in April 2020. The
Tenant stated the Landlord sent someone to look at the door, but the door was
never fixed.
 
7.     On cross examination, the Tenant did not know what positions
the 2 people held. The Tenant admitted she did not try to
contact the site superintendent Derek about the problem.
 
8.     On redirect, the Tenant testified she knew who the
site superintendent was, but she never had any communication with him. She assumed 1 of the people she emailed abou the issue was the site superintendent’s
superior.
 
9.     I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
Landlord breached section 20(1) of the
Act by failing to repair or maintain a working lock on the front door. The
Tenant was able to demonstrate they were having issues
with the door lock since April 2020,
that they tried to tell
someone about it by email, and the Landlord did not dispute knowing about this
issue. From April 2020 until they vacated, the Tenant lived with a front door
that did not lock. However, the Tenant gave no evidence that
this caused any harm or hardship. If the door not properly locking were a problem, the reasonable
tenant would have fixed it themselves if the landlord ignored the problem, then
asked the landlord to reimburse them
for the expense of fixing it
themselves. The Tenant failed to take any action to try to fix the problem
themselves, nor did they bring any T6 Application. The only raised this section 82 issue as a
problem in response to the L1 application.
 
10.  The Tenant asked
for a remedy of 25% rent abatement
during the months
of April 2020 to
December 30, 2020. Since there was no
evidence of any harmful impact due to the failure to repair or maintain, I do
not think the abatement requested is appropriate. The reasonable price to buy a new front door lock is $150. I find an abatement of $150 is appropriate
in the circumstances.
 
 
Front Door Main Entrance Buzzer
not working:
 
11.  The Tenant’s second
section 82 issue was about the front door main entrance buzzer not
working. The Tenant testified that the buzzer was a problem since she moved in.
The buzzer did not work between December 2019 until the Tenant vacated on
December 30, 2020. The Tenant testified the broken buzzer created a disruption
anytime she had visitors or had packages delivered. However, the Landlord
did not cross-exam the Tenant about this issue, so I am left with
no evidence what impact or how often a disruption occurred.




 
12.  Based on the evidence before me, since the Tenant said
the buzzer was broken, and since the Landlord brought no evidence to show it
worked or they tried to fix it, I am satisfied
on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord
breached section 20(1)
of the Act.
 
13.  The Tenant asked for a remedy of 25% rent abatement during the entire
tenancy from the time she moved in until the time she
vacated. I do not find any abatement
is warranted. There was no evidence any impact was suffered since there was no evidence
any visitors or packages were
disrupted.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated on December
30, 2020 as both parties had
agreed this was the vacate date.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $1,401.54, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to December 30, 2020, less the rent deposit, interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit and less the amount
of abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* $1,587.54 on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
