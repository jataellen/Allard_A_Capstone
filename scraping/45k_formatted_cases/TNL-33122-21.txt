Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33122-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2226, 5 SHEPPARD AVENUE E NORTH YORK
  ON M2N0G4


 




Between:


Nazanin Zangeneh


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Zimu Li


Tenant



 
 
 
Nazanin Zangeneh
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Zimu Li
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on November 25, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s Legal Representative Maryam
Cooper and the Tenant’s Legal Representative
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
May 2, 2021 to December
1, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 27,
2021.
 
2.    
The representatives agreed that all arrears had been paid to date; only the application fee remained outstanding.
 
3.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
