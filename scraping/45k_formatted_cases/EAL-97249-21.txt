Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97249-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


A, 733 FIRST STREET E CORNWALL ON K6H1M3


 




Between:


Elton Pang


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Poirier


Tenant



 
 
 
Elton Pang (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict John Poirier
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 23, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
June 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August
23, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant paid $30.00
after the application was filed.
 
3.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
including the impact of the pandemic and whether the Landlord attempted to
negotiate a payment plan, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Tenant
deliberately withheld the rent and spent it on other
things. The Tenant
refused to discuss a payment plan prior to the
hearing.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 25, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$5,967.33*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 18, 2022.




 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$26.30 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 25, 2022, then starting
January 26, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 26, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before January 25, 2022, the Tenant pays the
amount of $6,456.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for
eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required
under that subsection on or after January
26, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
