In the
  matter of:


803, 180 CHALKFARM DRIVE TORONTO ON M3L2H8


 




Between:


Greenboard Holdings Ltd


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Wilroy
  Wolfe


Tenant



 
 
 
Greenboard
Holdings Ltd (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Wilroy Wolfe (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises.
The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate
the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each
day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord,
represented by Geoff Paine, attended the hearing. The Landlord’s witness, Mariela
Tamayo, attended the hearing and gave evidence
in support of the Landlord.
The Tenant signed in for the hearing by 9am, spoke with Tenant
Duty Counsel and attempted mediation with the Landlord. As of 2:23pm when the
matter was called, the Tenant was not present or represented.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
1.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,279.17 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
2.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
September 5, 2021
 
3.    
On August 6, 2021 the
Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 notice pursuant to subsection 62 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’). The notice alleged that the Tenant, an
occupant of the Tenant, or a person permitted in the residential complex by the
Tenant caused wilful or negligent damage to the quartz kitchen countertop. The
Landlord alleged that they discovered the damage on March 4, 2021 during an inspection of the rental unit.




 
4.    
Subsection 62(3) of the
Act states that a tenant can void an N5 Notice by repairing the damaged
property or paying the landlord the reasonable costs of repairing or replacing
the damaged property if it is not reasonable to repair it. Subsection 62(3)
also provides that the tenant
can make satisfactory arrangements with the Landlord to repair the damaged
property or to pay for the replacement of the damaged property.
 
5.    
In this case, the seven-day voiding
period began on August 6, 2021 and ended on August
13, 2021.
 
6.    
I find that the Tenant
did send a letter to the Landlord on August 12, 2021 suggesting payment arrangements. However, I don’t find that the Tenant
voided the N5 notice. The Tenant did not provide any dates that
they would make the payments or the amounts they would pay.
 
7.    
The Tenant’s
letter was entered
in evidence by the Landlord
at the hearing. The letter indicates that the Tenant will
agree to pay the Landlord $3,147.05 for the damaged countertop over a period of
4-6 months starting in September 2021.
 
8.    
The Landlord testified
that the Tenant has made no payments towards the cost of the damage as of the date of the hearing
and therefore the payment arrangements are not acceptable.
 
9.    
It was the evidence
of the Landlord that the Tenant did not repair
or replace the damaged property or make satisfactory
arrangements with the Landlord during the voiding period. Accordingly, I am
satisfied that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice.
 
10.  The Landlord submitted into evidence a copy
of the move-in inspection report dated October
15, 2018. The Landlord testified
that there were no deficiencies noted on the report and no mention of any damage to
the quartz kitchen countertop. The report is signed by the Tenant.
 
11. 
The Landlord also
submitted into evidence a photograph showing the countertop with lines across
it. The Landlord testified that these
are cracks in the stone and that they cannot
be repaired. The Landlord submits
that the entire countertop must be replaced.
 
12.  The Landlord submitted into evidence a copy
of a contractor quote from ZGemi that estimated the replacement of the countertop in the amount
of $3,147.05 inclusive
of HST. The quote is dated
July 13, 2021 and refers specifically to unit 803 at 180 Chalkfarm.
 
13.  The Landlord further
testified that the Tenant was sent a letter on July 21, 2021 regarding the damaged countertop. The letter was submitted into evidence at
the hearing. The letter outlines that
the Landlord noticed damage to the countertop during an inspection and provided
that the Tenant can avoid further legal action by paying $3,147.05 to the
Landlord by July 28, 2021. The
Landlord testified that the Tenant did not pay the Landlord, so they issued the
N5 notice.
 
4.    
Based on the uncontested evidence of the Landlord, I find on a balance
of probabilities, that the
Tenant, an occupant of the rental unit, or a person permitted in the
residential




 
complex by the Tenant
has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the rental
unit by causing the stone quartz kitchen countertop to crack and break.
 
5.    
I am satisfied, based on the evidence of the Landlord, that the Landlord
will incur costs of
$3,147.05 to replace property
that was damaged
and cannot be reasonably repaired.
 
6.    
At the hearing, the
Landlord requested a conditional order to give the Tenant an opportunity to preserve the Tenancy by paying the cost to replace the countertop. The Landlord requested an order that would
allow the Tenant 30 days to pay for the countertop in the amount of $3,147.05.
 
7.    
The Landlord
also requested the $186.00 application filing fee.
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,147.05, which represents the reasonable costs of replacing the damaged property.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay this amount on or before
February 15, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to
pay $3,147.05 on or before February 15, 2022, then the Landlord may apply to the Board within
30 days of the breach
pursuant to section
78 of the Act, for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application by February 15, 2022.
 
5.    
If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
 
 
January 17, 2022 Date Issued
 
Toronto North-RO
47 Sheppard
Avenue East, Suite 700, 7th Floor
Toronto ON M2N5X5
