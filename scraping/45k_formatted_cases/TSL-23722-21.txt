Salvatore
Benedetto and 913255 Ontario Inc. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Justine
Lavigne (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlords’ Agent, Stephanie
Chow, attended the hearing. As of 2:34 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective August
18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
November 6, 2021. The Tenant was in possession
of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent was
$895.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $300.00
after the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
6, 2021, the date the Tenant returned
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords.




File Number: TSL-23722-21
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlords $3,073.24*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
November 6, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
