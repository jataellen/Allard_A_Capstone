under Section 69

Tenancies Act, 2006

RSB and MB (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict BAS and JS (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Burlington on
November 2, 2018.  The Landlords and JS (on behalf of
both Tenants) attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
 
1.     
The tenancy agreement made
on January 9, 2017, sets the monthly rent at $3,000.00.
2.     
The Tenants dispute the
arrears amount alleging that the Landlords agreed to reduce the monthly rent
from $3,000.00 to $1,800.00, in order to assist the Tenants as the Tenant that
attended the hearing was incarcerated.  The Tenant that attended the hearing
submitted that the agreement to reduce the rent was a verbal agreement made on
September 23, 2017.  The Tenant also testified that they paid $1,800.00 from
October 2017 through August 2018.
3.     
The Landlord denied that
there was a verbal agreement to reduce the rent.  Rather, the Landlords
testified that they were contacted by the Tenant that did not attend the
hearing and the Tenants’ daughter in September 2017 asking the Landlord to accept
$1,800.00 during the absence of the Tenant that attended the hearing and
promising to pay the arrears upon his return. 
4.     
The Landlords rely on text
message exchanges in which the Landlords confirm the agreement (with no
response from the Tenants).  On May 23, 2018, the Tenant that attended the
hearing texted the Landlords advising that he is working hard to collect on his
accounts receivables to generate funds to cover the arrears.  In a June 27,
2018, text message the Tenant again makes note of covering the full rent and
the arrears.  No specific dollar amount is mentioned by the Tenant with respect
to the “arrears”.
5.     
The Landlords also rely on
two documents signed by themselves and the Tenant that attended the hearing.
One document appears to have been signed on July 16, 2018, and appears to be a
ledger which states that the arrears as of July 16, 2018, are $13,300.00.  The
document other appears to have been signed sometime before July 18, 2018, and
states:                                                                                                                                                  I
JS promise to pay the following towards the rent and account for rent in
arrears for [the rental unit]                                                                                                    July
18
1,200                                                                                                              
August 1: 6,000 min. + plus                                                                                               Sept
1: 6,000 + plus.
6.     
The Tenant testified that he
signed these documents under duress because he was afraid of being evicted.
7.     
I am not satisfied that
there was a verbal agreement to reduce the rent as claimed by the Tenants.  The
Tenants’ position is entirely self-serving and is unsupported by any
documents.  On the other hand, the Landlords’ position appears to be in concert
with written documents confirming the arrears and the Tenant’s acknowledgement
of those arrears.  
8.     
I am also not satisfied that
the Tenant signed these documents under duress.  As held by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario in Taber v. Paris
Boutique & Bridal Inc. (Paris Boutique), 2010 ONCA 157: 
There
is no doubt that economic duress can serve to make an agreement unenforceable against
a party who was compelled by the duress to enter into it.  Nor is there any
doubt that the party can have the agreement declared void on this basis.
However, not
all pressure, economic or otherwise, can constitute duress sufficient to carry
these legal consequences.  It must have two elements: it must be pressure that
the law regards as illegitimate; and it must be applied to such a degree as to
amount to “a coercion of the will” of the party relying on the concept.
9.     
The Tenant merely submitted
that he felt duress because of the threat of eviction.  The evidence before me
is that unless the Tenant agreed to a plan of payment of the arrears the
Landlords would commence eviction proceedings.  This is a justifiable and
lawful act on the part of the Landlord.  There is no allegation before me that
the Landlords applied pressure in a manner that can be considered illegitimate.
10.   The Tenant also testified that he paid $5,400.00
since the application was filed and not the $3,500.00 that the Landlord has
credited as paid.  The Tenant points to a payment of $1,300.00 on July 18,
2018; $1,200.00 on August 3, 2018; and $700.00 on September 9, 2018.  There is
nothing in the evidence that convinces me that the July and August payments are
not accounted for in the Landlords’ ledger as the amounts themselves are less
than or equal to the amount the Landlords have credited the Tenants for July
and August.  With respect to the September 9, 2018, transfer of $700.00, the
Landlords acknowledged the hearing that they may have missed that payment.
$700.00 shall be credited in this order as paid by the Tenants after the
application was filed. 
11.   The Tenants have not paid the total rent the
Tenants were required to pay for the period from October 1, 2017 to November
30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination
effective September 20, 2018.
12.   The Landlords collected a rent deposit of
$2,900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlords.
13.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenants for the period from February 1, 2015 to September 20, 2018.
14.   I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
For the above
Reasons, it is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before November
18, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlords $18,019.83*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to November 7, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $98.63 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting November 8, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before November 18, 2018, the
Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated
from November 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before November 18, 2018, then starting November 19, 2018, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after November 19, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before November
18, 2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $23,590.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after November 19,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
