Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99249-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


8 WELLINGTON STREET E ATHENS ON
  K0E1B0


 




Between:


Andrea Catellier


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Elizabeth (Beth) Birch Kevin Moxley


Tenants



 
 
 
On January 24, 2022, Andrea
Catellier (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Elizabeth (Beth) Birch and Kevin Moxley
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
