Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03138-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


11, 7 ELMWOOD AVENUE
SOUTH MISSISSAUGA ON L5G3J6


 




Between:


Norah Schraivogel Mjm Investments Inc.


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Jessica Taylor


Tenant



 
 
Norah Schraivogel and Mjm
Investments Inc. (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jessica
Taylor (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. As
of 10:46 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this
hearing by the Board. The Landlord’s
Agent, Lydia Salvi attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period
from July 1, 2021 to January
31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective September
22, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,550.00.
 
4.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,550.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 15, 2021 to
September 22, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order
as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $9,053.49*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$50.96 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 19, 2022,
the Tenant will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 20,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $11,901.00** to the Landlords or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit.
If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlords may file this
order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
