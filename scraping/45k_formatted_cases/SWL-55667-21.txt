Fraser Sulatycki Krystina Sulatycki


Tenants



 
Meddco Properties Inc. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Krystina Sulatycki
and Fraser Sulatycki
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Jessica
Lapkowski, attended the hearing. As of 10:28 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 25, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,039.02.
 
4.     The Tenants paid all arrears
for the period ending January
31, 2022 after the application was filed.
 
5.     The only amount
outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing the application. As a result, the order will be limited to costs
only and not eviction.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.




File Number: SWL-55667-21
 
2.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing on or before February 8, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from February 9,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
