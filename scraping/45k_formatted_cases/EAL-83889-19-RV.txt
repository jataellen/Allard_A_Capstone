Order under Section 21.2 of the
Statutory Powers
Procedure Act
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-83889-19-RV
 
 
 
Review Order
 
 
BDC (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict DP (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or
someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was resolved
by order EAL-83889-19 issued on August
4, 2020.
 
On September 17, 2020 the Tenant requested
a review of the order and that the order be
stayed until the request to review the order is resolved.
 
On September 22, 2020 interim order EAL-83889-19-RV-IN was issued, staying
the order issued on August 4, 2020.
 
The request
was heard in Passcode: 914 1744 8646# on December
10, 2021. Only the Tenant’s
Representative, JD attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant challenges on review the Member’s findings
that PW was employed by the Landlord and consequently was not entitled
to represent the Landlord or sign the Notice of Termination. The Member made an error in law by finding
the first N5 didn’t have to be proven; that she improperly made her findings of
fact based on hearsay and how her she errored having considered PS’s email
received via post hearing submission that wasn’t properly admitted.

2.    
Based on the submissions made, I
am satisfied the Member errored in not making a finding that the Landlord
had a reasonable basis in filing the first N5 Notice or that on its
face the Landlord did not have to prove the reasons for issuing the Notice under
section 64 of the Act before another N5 Notice can be issued under 67 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
As such, the review is granted and the
hearing is heard de novo.
 
3.     On February 26, 2021, the Landlord emailed
the Board to “cancel this order as the tenant has vacated this unit. Order
EAL-83889-19”. Previously on September 13, 2021, the Landlord emailed the Board
stating “we sent a prior request to close this as the tenant has left over a
year ago. As well, we no longer own the building”. Essentially the communication from the Landlord requested the
Board’s consent to cancel the hearing order and the review hearing so that he
can withdraw his application.
 
4.    
On November 5, 2021, the Board
issued a Direction informing the Landlord to attend the hearing on December 10, 2021 because
they can’t stop the review
hearing or change
the Order because the request was made by the Tenant.
 
5.     Since the Landlord did not attend the hearing to
support the L2 application filed and in consideration of the emails
by the Landlord on the Board file which indicates
the Landlord was not
interested in pursuing the application for eviction, I find the application abandoned.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order
EAL-83889-19 issued on August 4, 2021 is granted. The order is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     The L2 application is dismissed.
