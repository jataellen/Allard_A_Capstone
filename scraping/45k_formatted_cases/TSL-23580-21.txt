Tenants



 
 
Royal Bank Of Canada C/o Gowling
Wlg (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict David
Rak, Krystyna Rutkowska and All Adult Tenants (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered into an
agreement of purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 16, 2021 at 11:52am. Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. the Landlord was represented by Terry Moffatt. Determinations:
1.     The Landlord is a mortgagee in possession who is a
deemed Landlord pursuant to subsection 47(1) of the Mortgages
Act 1997, c. 24, s. 215 (5) in February 2021. This
section states:
 
47 (1) A person who becomes the
mortgagee in possession of a mortgaged residential complex which is the subject
of a tenancy agreement between the mortgagor
and a tenant or who obtains title
to the residential complex by foreclosure
or power of sale shall be deemed to be the landlord under the tenancy
agreement.
 
2.     On February 23, 2021 a Notice of Attornment and Notice
of Change of Landlord was served to the Tenants directing them to make all future
rent payments to the ‘deemed’ Landlord with instructions on
how to do so.
 
L2 APPLICATION
 
3.     By way of background, this is a month to month tenancy
in which the rent is due on the
fourth of the month in the amount of $2,200.00.




 
4.    
The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
5.    
The Landlord’s L2 application
filed on August 12, 2021 is based on a N12 notice of termination served
to the Tenant on June 14, 2021 with a termination date of
September 3, 2021 pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006.
 
6.     Pursuant to subsection 72(1)(b) of the Act, the
Landlord filed the affidavit from the Purchaser, Andrew Grogan, affirming that he would
require the rental
property for his and
his family’s own personal use. A copy of the purchase and sale agreement
dated May 25, 2021
was also submitted into evidence in support of this assertion, confirming that vacant possession was a condition of this
agreement.
 
7.    
With respect to
compensation under section 49.1 of the Act, the Landlord’s uncontested evidence
was that the Tenants were in arrears of rent since the notice of attornment was
served to them. As such, the Landlord reduced to the rent arrears by one month
(waived the rent for the period
August 4 – September 3, 2021) to satisfy this requirement. In doing
so, I find that the Landlord has satisfied the compensation requirement under
section
49.1 and 55.1 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
8.    
The Landlord
seeks a termination of the tenancy as early as possible.
ANALYSIS
9.     Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
states
 
49 (1) A landlord of a residential complex that contains no more than
three residential units who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale
of the residential complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good
faith requires possession of the residential complex or the unit for the
purpose of residential occupation by,
 
the purchaser;
 
10. 
Based on the uncontested evidence before the Board,
I find that the purchaser genuinely intends to move
into the rental unit and use it for residential purposes. I also find that the Landlord has met all the
requirements under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 with respect to
the N12 served pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Act.
 
11.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any
circumstances that would justify relief from eviction.
 
12.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 6, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
