2381353
Ontario Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Jacqui Stefurak (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted
in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the
safety of any person
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Agent, Domenic Serafino,
and the Tenant,
Jacqui Stefurak, attended
the hearing.
 
At the hearing,
I raised a preliminary issue with
respect to service of the N7 Notice
of Termination (‘the Notice’). The Landlord’s Agent submitted that the Notice
had been sent by registered mail to the Tenant on
May 26, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent further submitted that the Tenant
did not pick up the registered mail therefore the same Notice was mailed to the
Tenant on June 21, 2021.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The termination date on the Notice was June 30, 2021
and the Notice was mailed to the Tenant on June 21, 2021.
 
2.     The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘the Act’)
sets out that the Notice must be given to the Tenant at least 10 days before
the termination date on the Notice and five days must be added if the Notice is
mailed.
 
3.    
The Notice was not served in accordance with the Act therefore the Notice is
defective.
 
4.     The Landlord requested consent to withdrawal their
application. In accordance with
subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the application.
