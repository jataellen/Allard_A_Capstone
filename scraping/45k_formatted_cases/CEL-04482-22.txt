Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04482-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


2, 116 MAPLE
AVENUE BARRIE ON L4N1S4


 




Between:


Ian Hocking
Hocking Management Corp


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Celynn Cantin


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 17, 2022, Ian Hocking
and Hocking Management Corp (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Celynn Cantin (the 'Tenant') and for an order
to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on December 15, 2021
with respect to application CEL-02255- 21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1,189.00 rent on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenant did not
pay $558.42 arrears on or before January 14, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $6,701.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order CEL-02255-21. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $6,701.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous
order CEL-02255-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $1,175.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 20, 2020
to February 2, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order CEL-02255-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $7,888.83*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to February 2, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlords $39.09 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 3, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 14,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 14, 2022.
