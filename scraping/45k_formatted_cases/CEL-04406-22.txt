File Number: CEL-04406-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


#2 BASEMENT, 11 ALAMOSA COURT BRAMPTON ON L6Y 2Z4


 




Between:


Purushotham Rao Nakka Cs


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Talia Faliero


Tenant



 
 
 
Purushotham Rao Nakka Cs (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Talia
Faliero (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant
entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord and the Tenant
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
February 16, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 16, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 16, 2022, then starting
February 17, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 17, 2022.

the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of

not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
