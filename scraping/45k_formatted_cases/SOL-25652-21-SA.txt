Order under Section 77(8)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-25652-21-SA
 



In the matter
of:


49 BIGGAR AVENUE HAMILTON ON L8L3Z3


 




Between:


Isabella Spadafora
  Rosie Spadafora


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Judy Bearfoot Thomas Havers


Tenants



 
 
Isabella
Spadafora and Rosie Spadafora (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Thomas Havers
and Judy Bearfoot
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate
the tenancy.
 
That application was resolved by order SOL-25652-21 issued on November
29, 2021. The Tenants
filed a motion to set aside order SOL-25652-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on January 31, 2022. Only the Landlord, Rosie
Spadafora and the Landlords' Legal Representative, N. Grobar attended the
hearing. As of 2:16 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the
hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Since the Tenants
did not appear at the hearing to support the motion, I find that this motion has been abandoned.
 
2.     The Landlords requested an order for costs against the
Tenants for failing to attend the hearing.
 
3.     Section 77 (1) (6) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 permits a Tenant to make a motion to the Board to set aside an ex parte
order such as SOL-25652-21, within
10 days after the order is issued. The Tenants made the motion as of right and
no evidence was provided to demonstrate that the motion was initiated in bad
faith. Therefore, the request for cost is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The motion to set aside Order SOL-25652-21, issued on
November 29, 2021, is denied. Order SOL-25652-21 is unchanged.
