Barbara Ballentine
  Chris Farrell


Tenants



 
 
 
Dehoop Construction Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Chris Farrell and Barbara Ballentine (the 'Tenants') because they have
been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard by video conference
on November 17, 2021.
 
At 2:26 pm, the Landlord’s Representative Logan Weaver attended
the hearing.
 
This amended order is issued to add
the unit #108 to complete the address
of the rental unit at 20
Elmwood Street, Kingston ON K7M 2Y5.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it
was due.
 
2.     The rental unit is an apartment in a multi-unit complex.
 
3.     The tenancy began in or around 2016.
 
4.     The monthly rent is $1 248.48.
 
Persistently Late
 
 
5.     Pursuant to subsection 58(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’):
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following
grounds:




 
 
 
The tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date if becomes
due and payable.
 
The termination date set out on the notice must be at the end of the term or period
of the tenancy.
 
6.    
The Landlord served the Tenants with a Notice
to Terminate the Tenancy at the End of
Term (N8 notice) on July 31, 2021. The termination date set out in the N8
Notice is September 30, 2021.
 
 
Evidence and Testimony
 
7.    
It was the uncontested testimony and evidence
of the Landlord’s Representative that the Tenants were persistently late in
paying the rent on the date it was due. It is the Landlord’s position that late
payment of rent has been an issue for the duration of the tenancy.
 
8.    
According to the ledger,
the Tenant has been late or
not paid the rent in full, from May
2021 through to and including August 2021.
 
9.    
The Landlord’s Representative indicated that partial rent was paid in September
2021 and no rent paid in October, November 2021.
 
10.  According to the Landlord’s Representative and
evidence submitted, several attempts have been made to communicate with the Tenants
and a payment plan was offered on or
around May, July and October 2021, with no response from the Tenants.
 
11.  It was the uncontested position of the Landlord’s
Representative that the Landlord has made reasonable attempts
to discuss this issue with the Tenants
in person, by email and written correspondence.
 
12. 
The Landlord’s Representative indicated that late payment
has caused significant hardship and stress for the
Landlord and retained the assistance of Mr. Weaver.
 
13.  When asked about the circumstances of the Tenants and
any consideration that should be made in relation to delaying or denying
eviction, the Landlord’s Representative indicated that the Tenants,
despite several communication attempts, did not respond and chose not to participate in the hearing. The Tenants have a history of applications before the
Board.
 
14.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from
eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
15. 
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.




 
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenants
must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
