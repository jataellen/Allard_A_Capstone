Ryan Litwinczuk


Tenant



 
 
 
Skrtich Living (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ryan Litwinczuk (the 'Tenant').
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 5, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, Christian Coulombe attended
the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This application is based on two notices
of termination served
pursuant to section
68(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
2.    
Pursuant to section 68(1) of the Act,
a landlord is permitted to serve a non-voidable notice of termination where
there was a previous voidable
notice served on the
Tenant pursuant to section 62, 64 or 67 of the Act.
 
3.     The first notice of termination was served on the
Tenant on July 14, 2021 because the Tenant had destroyed property, was fighting and using drugs in the common areas of
the rental unit. The Landlord’s
representative states that the Tenant corrected his behaviour during the seven
day voiding period. Pursuant to
section 64(3) of the Act, as the Tenant corrected his behaviour during the seven day period,
the first notice of termination
is void.
 
4.     The second notice of termination was served on the
Tenant on September 7, 2021 pursuant to section 68 of the Act. That section entitles the Landlord to
serve a non- voidable N5 if there is another incident that occurs more than
seven days but less than six months after the Landlord served the first N5
notice. I am satisfied that the Tenant was served with a valid first notice within the meaning of section 68(1) of the Act, and the Landlord was
entitled to serve notice on which this application is based.




 
5.    
The Landlord’s representative states
that the Tenant
rents a bedroom
from the Landlord and that there are two other
tenants residing in the unit.
 
6.     The Landlord’s representative states that on September
7, 2021 the Tenant was observed by the Landlord’s representative physically
fighting with other individuals in the common
areas of the rental unit and the Tenant threatened the Landlord’s representative. The Landlord’s
representative also stated that other tenants residing in the rental unit are unable to use the common areas
because of the Tenant’s fighting and drug use in the common areas.
 
7.     With respect to the Landlord’s allegation that the
Tenant was overcrowding, the Landlord’s representative states
that the Tenant always had people staying
overnight in the rental unit
and that he saw suitcases that belonged to these people in the common areas.
 
8.    
Section 67 of the Act states:
 
A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if the number of persons occupying
the rental unit on a continuing basis results in a contravention of health, safety or housing standards required by law.
 
9.     At the hearing, the Landlord’s representative did not
provide evidence of any health, safety or housing standards which permitted a
maximum occupancy of 1 person. Consequently,
the Landlord has not proved
the validity of this portion
of the N5 notice.
 
10.  In order to find that the Tenant has breached his obligations under section 64 of the Act, I must be satisfied that the Tenant’s
conduct has “substantially interfered” with another residents “reasonable
enjoyment”. This wording means that
not every interference will justify eviction.
In order to justify eviction, I must be satisfied that the interference
is substantial either in its impact or by its nature. Further, the use of the word “reasonable” means the Board must
apply an objective test to the interference complained of.
 
11.  Based on the uncontested evidence and submissions of
the Landlord’s representative, and on a balance of probabilities, I find that
the Tenant’s conduct of physically fighting with other individuals in the
common areas of the rental unit and threatening individuals has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
of the residential complex
and that termination of the tenancy is justified.
 
12.  Having found the Landlord has proven the allegations
under section 64 of the Act, I will
turn my mind to relief from eviction, as required under section 83 of the Act.
 
13.  The Landlord’s representative testified that he has addressed the Tenant’s behaviour on a
number of occasions. The Tenant’s
actions are preventing the Landlord from meeting its obligations to ensure
other residents can reasonably enjoy the residential complex, as the
fighting from the Tenant is repeatedly disturbing others. Considering this and all of the disclosed
circumstances, I find that it would unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
14.  The Landlord has incurred costs of $186.00
for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
 
15.  This order contains
all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons
will be issued.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is vacated
on or before February 28, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the costs of the filing
of the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
