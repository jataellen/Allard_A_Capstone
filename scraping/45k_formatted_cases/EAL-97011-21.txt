Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-97011-21
 
 
In the matter
of:      27 NORTH BARTLETT
STREET
KINGSTON ON K7K1X0
 




Between:                  Duo Fu Liguang Liang


Landlords




 
 
and
 
Christina Duncan                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
 
Duo Fu and Liguang Liang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christina Duncan (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (‘L1 application’).
 
The Landlords
also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because
the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest
of the Landlords or another tenant (‘L2 application’).
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord, Duo Fu, and the Landlord's Legal Representative, Teresa Baykara,
attended the hearing. As of 11:50 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
April 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective May 27, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $625.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.    
The Tenant paid $300.00
after the application was filed.




 
6.    
As of the hearing date,
the Tenant owed the Landlords $4,000.00 in arrears of rent to November 30, 2021. The rent for December 2021 and January
2022 has since become due. Therefore, the total owing by
the Tenant as of the date of this order is $5,451.00, which includes
arrears of rent to January
31, 2022 ($5,250.00) and the application filing fee ($201.00). If the Tenant made rental payments to the
Landlords after the hearing, those payments should be deducted from the total
owing in this order.
 
7.    
The Tenant
caused undue damage
to the door of the rental unit. The
Landlord submitted a picture
of the broken door and a Rona receipt in the amount
of $90.39. The Landlord is entitled to this amount as compensation
for the cost of replacing the broken door pursuant to section 89 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).
 
8.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Act, including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate
a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 18, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlords $4,803.54*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 7, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$90.39 as compensation for the cost of
replacing the broken door in the residential complex.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $20.55
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 8, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 18, 2022, then starting January
19, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after January 19, 2022.
 
9.    
If, on or before
January 18, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $5,451.00** to the Landlords or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.
This means that the tenancy would
not be terminated and the Tenant could
remain in the unit. If this payment




 
is not made in full and on time, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that
the eviction may be enforced.
 
10.  The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
19, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
