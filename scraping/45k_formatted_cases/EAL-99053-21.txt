Tenants



 
 
Cindy Tran and Duong Dai (Mike)
Tran (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael
F. Nicolitsis and Tanya Patricia
Carol Gendron (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent
that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 15, 2022. Only one of the Landlords, Duong Dai (Mike) Tran, attended
the hearing. As of 2:44 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination effective December 6, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on February 6, 2022. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,500.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of February
6, 2022, the date the Tenants returned
vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.




File Number: EAL-99053-21
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlords $14,588.93*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 6, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do not pay the
Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March 7, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 8, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
