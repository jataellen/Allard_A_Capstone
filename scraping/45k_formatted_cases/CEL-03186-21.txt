M Residential Real Estate Lp (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Justin
Chivers (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially
interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:

27, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative Kristina Klein, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.
 
After hearing testimony from the Landlord’s witness Ted Edy, and testimony
from the Tenant,
the Tenant requested a delay in terminating the tenancy until February
28, 2022. The Landlord’s
representative and the Landlord’s Property Manager agreed to the request.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
28, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
