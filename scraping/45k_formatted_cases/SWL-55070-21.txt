In the matter

LASSALINE AVENUE WINDSOR ON

Between:


Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Cheylyn
Kisch


Tenant



 
 
 
Windsor Essex Community Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Cheylyn Kisch (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on January 6, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Cameron Parrot, attended the hearing. As of 10:26 a.m., the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective June 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $129.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant paid $1,829.00 after the application was filed.
 
6.     The Landlord waives the application filing fee.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief
from eviction subject to the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.

January 2024 in full, on or before the first day of each corresponding month.
 
3.    
If the Tenant fails to make any of the payments
in accordance with paragraph 2, and by the dates required, then:
 
(a)  
The Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) for
an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant, and for the payment
of any new arrears of rent and NSF charges not already ordered under paragraph
1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a
breach of a condition set out in paragraph 2 of this order.
 
(b)  
The balance owing under paragraph 1 of this
order shall become payable on the day following
the date of default. The monies owing shall bear interest at the
post-judgment interest rate determined under subsection 207(7) of the Act.
