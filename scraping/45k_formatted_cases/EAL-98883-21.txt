Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98883-21



In the matter
of:


2006, 2001 CARLING
AVENUE OTTAWA ON K2A3W5


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


and


 




 


John Gramer Marian Gramer


Tenants



 
On November
8, 2021, Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Marian
Gramer and John Gramer (the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 26, 2021 with
respect to application EAL- 96112-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants have not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord
$10,441.01 on or before October
15, 2021 towards costs and
arrears of rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were
ordered to pay $10,441.01 for rent arrears in Order EAL-96112-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $10,441.01 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous order EAL-96112-21 is
cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have also
failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,466.59 from the
Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.




File Number: EAL-98883-21
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from December
8, 2020 to January 5, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-96112-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $10,437.96*. This amount represents the rent owing up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $48.16
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 1,
2021 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about this order,
call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
