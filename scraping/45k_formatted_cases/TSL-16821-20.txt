Urmilaben Teliawala (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Gregory Kaczur, Scot Reed
and Roland Albert (the 'Tenants') to pay the rent that they owe.
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on October
12, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenant's Representative attended the hearing.
The Landlord’s daughter also attended to assist the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord purchased the property (residential complex) from former
Landlord (Estate of Petro
Lisik) December 6, 2019.
 
2.    
A copy of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale (APS)
was submitted as part of the
Landlord application that stipulated the following conditional terms of the APS
•        
that the Purchaser was to receive
vacant possession of the property
on closing, and
•        
that the former Landlord
was to give the Tenant(s)
the requisite notices
under the Residential
tenancies Act requiring vacant possession of the property for use by the Buyer.
•        
If the Seller is unable to provide
vacant possession as a result of any and all limitations imposed on them by the
Residential Tenancies Act, the Purchaser agrees…to assume the Tenant(s)
and pursue the eviction process
independently.
 
3.     On closing the former Landlord
did not obtain vacant possession of the residential complex, and the sale of the
property proceeded and closed.
 
4.     On July 17, 2020 the Landlord filed
a A2 application about a Sublet or an Assignment and a L9 application to collect rent the Tenant(s) owe.
 
5.     The named Tenants
were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed.




File Number: TSL-16821-20
 
 
 
6.     An A2 application has no cause of action
based on the relationship between
the landlord and the assumed
Tenants.
 
7.     The L9 application filed by the Landlord did not
provide sufficient information with regard to how the amount of rent arrears
being claimed. No N4 notice was given to each of the named Tenants
and the Landlord’s claim for rent owing does not set out the monthly
rent that was to be paid by each of the named Tenants based on their
respective tenancy agreement.
 
8.     I find the Landlord’s applications are incomplete and without cause of action based on the
relationship between the Landlord and the named Tenant(s).
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
