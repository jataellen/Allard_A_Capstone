and


 




 


Steven Garbe


Tenant



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Steven
Garbe (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant or someone visiting the Tenant or
living with the Tenant wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit or the
residential complex.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 17, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s Legal
Representative Tanya Rose, the Landlord’s Property Manager Kailen Mulcahy (‘K.M.”),
the Tenant and the Tenant’s
partner Shannon Shepherd
attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On March 3, 2021, the Landlord gave a N5 notice of
termination to the Tenant pursuant to section 62 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, (the ‘Act’).
The Landlord alleged in the N5 notice
of termination that the Tenant
was uncooperative and hindered remediation efforts with regard to a flooding event that took place on February 8, 2021. As a result of the Tenant’s excessive amount
of possessions, which required a rental storage unit, and the Tenant turning
off the dehumidifiers and fans, the Landlord incurred additional equipment
rental charges in the amount of $1,269.61.
 
2.     On February 8, 2021, the radiator in the Tenant’s
rental unit malfunctioned which caused water
to squirt from it and damage the carpet and baseboards in the rental unit. Fire department personnel responded to a
fire alarm, which the Tenant had activated, who noted a large volume of items
in the Tenant’s rental unit and “there was a bit of a hoarding situation going
on”.
 
3.     Remedial efforts were immediately instituted by the
Landlord who retaining a cleaning company who installed
three fans and a dehumidifier in the rental to dry out the carpet.
It




 
was noted that a proper clean up
of the rental unit could not be undertaken due to the condition of the rental unit.
 
4.     The Landlord contends that due to the condition of the
rental unit and the Tenant repeatedly turning off the fans,
it took much longer to remediate the damage
and as a result, the Tenant should be responsible for the additional
expenses the Landlord incurred due to the Tenant’s actions.
 
5.     K.M. testified that the Landlord rented a storage unit
on the understanding that the cost would be billed back to the Tenant so that
the Tenant could remove items to affect a quick and timely process
for steam cleaning
the carpets and to allow proper remediation.
K.M. stated that the Tenant was not offered
temporary alternative accommodations as that would have been dealt with by any Tenant’s insurance.
 
6.    
The Tenant stated that he should
have been placed in another rental unit while the remediation took place but
admitted that he never made those inquiries to the Landlord. The Tenant does not dispute that he turned off the fans and dehumidifier in the rental
unit as his girlfriend has respiratory
issues, the rental unit became cold while the fans were in use, particularly because it was during the month of
February, and the rental unit was quite noisy which prevented their sleep.
 
7.     Based on all the evidence and submissions at the
hearing and on a balance of probabilities, I find that the Tenant wilfully or negligently
damaged the rental unit by prolonging remediation resulting in additional costs to the Landlord. The Tenant will be
ordered to pay the Landlord
$1,269.61 which is the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Landlord.
 
8.     The Landlord seeks termination of the tenancy but
alternatively sought an order for the payment
of their expenses
of $1,269.61 (cost of the storage
unit from February
11 to 28, 2021 and the additional
equipment) and an order that the Tenant maintain
a standard of cleanliness for a 12 month period. I find that quite reasonable in the circumstances.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with section 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order pursuant
to section 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. The Tenant has sustained a brain injury, is on disability
benefits and would like to continue his tenancy. He confirmed that he would be agreeable to paying the amount
outstanding but requires additional time to do so.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall maintain
the rental unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness for a six month
period starting February 17, 2022; for greater clarity, this means the Tenant
shall not permit the amount of possessions in the rental unit to rise to a
level of 4 or more on the
International OCD Foundation’s “Clutter
Image Rating”.




 
2.    
The Tenant shall co-operate and allow periodic
access to the rental unit to the Landlord’s
Agents and contractors, after being given written notice of entry in accordance
with the Act, for the purpose of inspections.
 
3.     If the Tenant fails to meet the terms contained in
paragraph 1 and 2 of this order, the Landlord
may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of
the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$1,269.91 representing the additional expenses incurred.
 
5.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before
April 30, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from May 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
