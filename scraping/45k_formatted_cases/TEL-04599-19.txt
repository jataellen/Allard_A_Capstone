Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-04599-19
 










 
 
 

A.K.
(AK) (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S.E.
(SE) (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes (L1 application).
 
The
Landlord applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant; and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the
Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date (L2 application).
 
These
applications were heard in Whitby on November 19, 2019.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Landlord produced an N1 notice of rent increase dated January 1, 2017 which
increased the rent from $825.00 to $835.00 effective May 1, 2017.
 
2.      The
Landlord produced an N1 notice of rent increase dated February 15, 2019 which
increased the rent from $835.00 to $850.00 effective June 1, 2019. 
 
3.      The
monthly rent charged in the N4 notice of termination (the N4) and the
application is $850.00.
 
4.      The
Tenant testified that she was never served with the first notice of rent
increase and that to the date of the hearing, when she paid rent, it was always
in the amount of $825.00. The only exception was that she paid the rent for
July 2019 in the amount of $850.00 because the Landlord threatened to evict her
if she did not do so. In the Tenant’s view the lawful rent is $825.00.
 
5.      The
Landlord testified that he served the first notice of rent increase on an
unspecified date in February 2019 and that he did not bring a certificate of
service to the hearing.
 
6.      As
well, the Landlord testified that the N4 does not include additional arrears of
$130.00 that would have arisen had the rent been increased as claimed to
$850.00. He did not include it because he was not interested in recovering this
amount.
 
7.      I
prefer the Tenant’s testimony that she did not receive the first notice of rent
increase to the Landlord’s imprecise testimony around the circumstances of
service of this notice. Also, the arrears set out in the notice are not
consistent with the alleged increase, which casts fatal doubt on the Landlord’s
claim to have served the first notice of rent increase. Given that the second
notice of rent increase is based on the first notice of rent increase, I
determined that neither notice can stand. I ruled that the monthly rent is
$825.00 and that the N4 is invalid because it overstates the lawful rent, and
therefore, the arrears owing.
 
8.      The
Landlord requested an order for arrears of rent only. 
 
9.      The
Tenant did not dispute the arrears claim set out in the application if adjusted
to a reflect a lawful rent of $825.00. As such, I amended the application to
set out the monthly rent as $825.00.
 
10.   Based
on the above, I determined that the Tenant has not paid $3,100.00 of the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2019 to
November 30, 2019. 
 
11.   The
Landlord relied on two N5 notices of termination, one created under section
64(1) and the other under section 68(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the RTA).
 
12.   The
Landlord testified that on the dates set out in these notices, other tenants in
the five unit complex complained of odors of animals coming from the Tenant’s
unit. Though these complaints are lodged on the Landlord’s cell phone, he did
not produce copies for the hearing. (As such, I declined to consider them). While
the Landlord does not live in the complex, on attending at it on August 17,
2019 and August 19, 2019 he detected these smells coming from the Tenant’s
unit, which he did not enter on either of those dates. The Landlord inspected
the unit on August 23, 2019 at which time he observed flies and mosquitoes in
the unit, as well as clutter as depicted in the photographs he submitted at the
hearing.
 
13.   The
Tenant testified that she has two dogs and one cat, which she does not allow to
defecate in the unit. She walks the dogs in the community four times daily. The
claimed odors do not come from her unit but from the units of some of her
fellow tenants, who also have dogs. The state of the unit on the Landlord’s
August 23, 2019 inspection, which the Tenant admitted to be accurate, occurred
because the Tenant was in the midst of cleaning and decluttering the unit, as
previously requested by the Landlord. The state on that day was not consistent
with the unit’s general condition.
 
14.   The
two dates, the event of the Landlord’s attendance at the complex, and the date and
allegation of the Landlord’s inspection are not set out in either N5 notice of
termination. As such, the Tenant had not been given adequate notice of these
claims, which I dismissed for this reason.
 
15.   As
well, the Tenant’s direct testimony about not being responsible for the odors complained
about by other tenants was subject to and withstood cross examination at the
hearing. By contrast, the Landlord’s hearsay testimony about the complaints by
other tenants was not testable. The Landlord did not even produce copies of
these complaints for my consideration. As such, I prefer the Tenant’s testimony
in this regard and determined that the Landlord has not proven that the Tenant has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant, as claimed.
 
16.   The
parties agreed that: the Tenant was persistently late in paying rent for the
three rental periods set out in the N8 notice of termination; this is monthly
tenancy; and the Tenant remains in the possession the rental unit.
 
17.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  Specifically, the number of periods of late rent
was sufficiently low that termination ought not result.  Instead it would be
more appropriate to subject the Tenant to the below probationary terms in
relation to this issue.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $3,100.00, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to November 30, 2019.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
3.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before August
2, 2020, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from August 3, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
4.      The
Landlord’s application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant is dismissed.
 
5.      Starting
August 1, 2020 and continuing on the first day of each month to July 1, 2021,
the Tenant shall pay the rent on time.
 
6.     
If the Tenant fails to comply with paragraph 5, the Landlord may
apply under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of
the Tenant’s breach.
