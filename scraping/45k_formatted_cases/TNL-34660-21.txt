Anmir Al-Jbouri Stephanie Carbonneau


Tenants



 
 
Gosford Property Management Inc.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Stephanie Carbonneau and Anmir Al-Jbouri (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on December 13, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Luisa Goncalves,
attended the hearing. As of 2:25 p.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing although properly
served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2020 to December
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective December 27, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on November 30, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,322.81.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,322.81 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2020 to September 27, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenants returned vacant possession of the unit to
the Landlord.

2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,245.97*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to November
30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants do
not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from January 17,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
