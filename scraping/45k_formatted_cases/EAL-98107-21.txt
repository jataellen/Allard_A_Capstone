In the matter
of:


B, 983
LAPORTE STREET S OTTAWA ON K1J7B2


 




Between:


Fereydoun (fred) Hatam


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Evodie Lubula


Tenant



 
 
 
Fereydoun (fred) Hatam (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Evodie Lubula (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the
Tenant owes.
 
Fereydoun (fred) Hatam (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Evodie Lubula
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
The Landlord and the Tenant attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
Preliminary issue:
When did the tenancy end?
 
1.     The tenancy ended
on October 28, 2021.
The Tenant was in possession of the rental
unit when the application was filed on August 26, 2021. There’s no
dispute the Tenant was last in the unit on October 28, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant stated she left the unit in September 2021
having returned to the unit on October 17, 2021 and October
28, 2021 to retrieve her property. The Landlord argues the Tenant is still in possession of the rental
unit to date because she hasn’t returned
the key.
 
3.     The Landlord received a text from the Tenant that she moved
out on October 17, 2021 but the text was not provided as proof to corroborate
the Landlord’s claim. The Tenant stated she went to the unit on that day to get diapers and was told to move her property so that the Landlord could do repairs. The Tenant indicated she was trying to move but




 
got Covid-19 and didn’t
return until October
28, 2021 when she found the locking
device was changed.
 
4.    
On October 28, 2021, the Tenant
called police and the Housing Enforcement Office (HEO) to gain access to the unit because
the Landlord changed
the locks. The Tenant
collected some of her belongs and has not been back to the unit since.
 
5.     Although the Landlord
stated he reinstalled the old locking system
and the unit was left as is, on November 7, 2021, the Landlord
texted the Tenant informing her he was cleaning up her unit and directed her to , “provide me with your address to bring
you all the things you have left behind”. The Tenant in response rudely cursed
the Landlord and told him never to message her again.
 
6.    
Based on the last communication
exchanged on November 7, 2021, it supports a finding the Landlord was not
interested in continuing the tenancy and based on the content and tone of the
Tenant’s text nor was she. I
recognize the Tenant still has property in the rental unit as of the date of this hearing but I find the tenancy
terminates by agreement
on October 28, 2021. There’s
no dispute the Tenant did not return to the unit or contacted the Landlord to
access the unit after October 28, 2021. The Landlord acknowledges the Tenant
hasn’t been back to the unit after October 28, 2021 nor has she paid rent.
 
L2 Application:
 
7.     The Landlord’s application for eviction based on N5 Notice of termination is moot
because the Tenant has vacated the rental unit.
 
L1 Application:
 
8.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
May 1, 2021 to October 28, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective August 16, 2021.
 
9.    
There’s no dispute the Tenant’s rent was partially paid by Ontario
works until the Tenant
cancelled the direct payment.
 
10.  The Tenant challenged the arrears owing on the application because she states she paid
the Landlord cash which was unsupported by any receipts or other documentary
evidence. The Landlord provided proof that payments were made by e-transfer
after Ontario Works stopped
paying part rent directly
which corroborates his testimony that the
Tenant paid by e-transfer and not cash. The Landlord submitted e-transfers that
correspond to the payments made in June and July 2021 as the identified on the
L1 application.
 
11.  The Tenant has made no payments towards
rent after the application was filed.
 
12.  The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,750.00 from the
Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




 
13.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2020 to August 16, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The L2 application is dismissed.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated on October 28, 2021.
 
3.     The Landlord shall permit the Tenant to access the rental unit up to January 29, 2022 to retrieve her property from the rental
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $6,127.83*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to October 28, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
6.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before November
8, 2021, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from November 9, 2021 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
