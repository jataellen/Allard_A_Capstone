Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26921-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


R, 1306 KING ST E HAMILTON ON L8M1H1


 




Between:


Emmanuel Anastasakis


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Johnny Iwashita


Tenant



 
 
 
On February 7, 2022, Emmanuel
Anastasakis (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Johnny Iwashita
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order
issued by the Board on February 7, 2022 with respect to application .
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant
has not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $500.00 arrears
on or before February 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting
order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $1,495.00 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order.
The amount that is still owing from that order is
$1,495.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,249.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.




File Number: SOL-26921-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 1, 2021 to February 23, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-25591-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 6, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,544.82*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 23, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$43.04 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 24, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March 6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 7, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 6, 2022, then starting March 7, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 7, 2022.
