In the matter of:      A3, 375 PATRICK
STREET
KINGSTON ON K7K6Z8
 
Between:                  Kingston Municipal Np Housing

and
 




Karen Green Robert Simpson


Tenants




 
 
 
Kingston Municipal Np Housing
Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Robert Simpson and Karen Green (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on December 18, 2020 with respect to application EAL-88157-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $500.00 arrears
on or before October 20, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $953.00 rent on or before
November 1, 2021 also the Tenant did not pay
$500.00 arrears
on or before November 20, 2021
or pay $953.00 rent on or before December 1, 2021.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenants were ordered to pay $11,564.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-88157-20. The amount that is still owing from that
order is $6,564.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order EAL-88157-20 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the order,
the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
Order EAL-88157-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated as of January
10, 2021. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2022.
 
3.       
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $8,783.32*. (less any amount paid after the application was filed on December 2, 2021.) This amount represents the rent owing up to January 10, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.       
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$31.33 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting January 11, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.       
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before January
21, 2022, the Tenants will
start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 21, 2022, then starting January
22, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 22, 2022.
 
8.       
The tenant has until January
20, 2022 to file a motion with the
Board to set aside the order under s. 78(9)
of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January
20, 2022 the order will be
stayed, and the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
9.       
In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 22,
2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
