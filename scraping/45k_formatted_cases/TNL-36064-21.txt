Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36064-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


272 ROSELAWN AVENUE TORONTO ON M4R1E9


 




Between:


Qiu Shen Huazhou
Yu


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Conner David Andy
Bradley Michael Andrews


Tenants



 
 
 
On November 8,
2021, Qiu Shen and Huazhou Yu (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Conner David Andy Bradley
and Michael Andrews
(the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement
to terminate the tenancy as of
November 15, 2021.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenants to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 17, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 17, 2022, then starting
January 18, 2022, the Landlords may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.




File Number: TNL-36064-21
 
 
 
 
3.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 18, 2022.

and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
