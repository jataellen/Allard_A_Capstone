In the matter
of:


13, 7 VIMY CRESCENT SARNIA ON N7S1J5


 




Between:


Wellington Apartments Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Robert Mitchell


Tenant



 
 
 
Wellington Apartments Inc (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Robert Mitchell (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant or another occupant of the
rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried out, or permitted
someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation in the rental
unit or the residential complex. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via video conference on January 10, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative Gail Kukor Lang, the Landlord’s Representative Amanda Somerville, and the
Landlord’s Witness, Corinne Griffin attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The uncontested evidence of the Landlord’s witness Corinne Griffin
(‘C.G.”) was that she
had ordered a package which was to be delivered to her apartment on August 29,
2021.
C.G. testified that she received a notification that the package
had been delivered
to her front door but that
when she opened the door to retrieve
the package, the package was gone.
 
2.     C.G. contacted police to inquire as to what to do and
the police filed a report bearing occurrence
number RM 21002765. The Board heard no evidence as to
whether charges were laid. Upon
police recommendation, C.G. contacted the Landlord to report the incident and attempted to determine what happened to her package
by reviewing security camera footage.
 
3.     The Landlord’s Representative Amanda Somerville (.A.S.)
testified that security
cameras were installed in the hallway of the Tenant and C.G’s apartment
and that there was camera footage taken showing the Tenant taking a package
outside C.G.’s door. A.S. testified
that in the camera footage, the Tenant is seen slowly walking to C.G.’s front




 
door, taking the package and then
proceeding to exit through the stairway doors.
Still photographs of the camera footage
showing the Tenant
and this incident
were tendered into evidence
at the hearing.
 
4.     A.S. confirmed that the individual in the camera footage was the Tenant and that she was certain of the identity of the Tenant
as she is familiar with his appearance, she had recently assisted the Tenant
with the signing of his lease and that his tenancy just began on August 1,
2021. C.G. also confirmed after
viewing the footage that the person taking the package from her front door was
the Tenant.
 
5.     C.G. testified that due to the theft of her package, she re-routes her packages to either a pick up at a facility or has packages
delivered to her daughter’s residence which is inconvenient to her as she has
to travel to those locations to retrieve her packages.
 
6.    
Pursuant to the Landlord
and Tenant Board Guidelines, the term “illegal” is not defined
in the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, but it would include a
serious violation of a federal, provincial or municipal
law. An illegal act will be
serious if it has the potential to affect
the character of the premises or to
disturb the reasonable enjoyment of the landlord or other tenants. I am satisfied that the theft of a package
constitutes an illegal act.
 
7.     A.S. testified that she has had no communication with
the Tenant since serving the N6 notice and the Landlord’s Legal Representative
confirmed that she sent documentation regarding this hearing, including a copy of the security
video, to the Tenant on December
31, 2021 and she has also had no communications with the Tenant.
 
8.    
Based on the uncontested evidence and submissions and on a balance
of probabilities, I find that the Landlord
has met their burden in establishing that the Tenant has committed an illegal act at the
residential complex.
 
9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of
the Act.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of March
31, 2022. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the costs
of this application by March 31, 2022.
 
3.    
If the Tenant does not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
March 31, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2022, then starting April 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after April 1, 2022.
 
 
 
February
3, 2022 Date Issued
 
South West-RO
150 Dufferin Avenue, Suite 400, 4th Floor
London ON N6A5N6

located.
