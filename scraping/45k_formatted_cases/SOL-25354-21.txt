Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
File Number:
SOL-25354-21
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 5675 CHURCH'S LANE NIAGARA FALLS ON L2J1Y8


 




Between:


Pat Deluca


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Diana Home Douglas
Home


Tenants



 
 
Pat Deluca (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Diana
Home and Douglas Home (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay
the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 1, 2022. Only
the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Joseph Tonnos, attended the hearing. As of
9:56 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2020 to February
28, 2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 8, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly rent is
$2,350.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,350.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from July 1, 2019 to
October 8, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $2,000.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$26,586.25*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $77.26 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 19, 2022, then starting
February 20, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 19, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $30,806.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 20, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
 
 
February 8, 2022
