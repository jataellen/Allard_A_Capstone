Tenant



 
 
 
Durham Region Non Profit Housing
Corp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Charles Reid (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board
on July 6, 2021 with respect to application TEL-16295- 21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The order provided that the
Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the
Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the hearing order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following conditions specified in the order: On or about November 23, 2021,
the Tenant harassed and was aggressive towards another visitor of the building. On or about November 24, 2021, upon entry
into the residential unit regarding the safety of an animal, a stolen tv was
observed and illicit drugs and paraphilia were in the apartment. On or about
November 24, 2021, it was observed through the building
surveillance that the Tenant had stolen a key for the large
communal mailbox and was using this space to sell illicit drugs to other
tenants in the building. This was a breach of paragraph 1 of the prior hearing
order. This application was filed
within 30 days of the breach.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
28, 2021 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).

If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2021, then starting January
29, 2021, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2021.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on July 29, 2022 if the order has not been
filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that
has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
