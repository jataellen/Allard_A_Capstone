Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19452-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1857 DALHOUSIE CRES OSHAWA ON L1G8C4


 




Between:


Wei Ling Shi


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Randy
Morin Sean Morin


Tenants



 
 
 
Wei Ling Shi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Randy Morin and Sean Morin (the 'Tenants') because the
Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 20, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Xiao Hong Chen attended the hearing. As of 3:28 p:m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 28, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $2,400.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord
is not holding a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     
The Tenants
have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 24, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $20,297.52*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 13, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $78.90 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 14, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 24, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 25, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 24, 2022, then starting January 25, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 25, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 24, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $21,786.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 25, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
