In the matter
of:      A, 01 GIBSON
LANE
MORRISBURG ON K0C1X0
 




Between:                  Gerben Schaillee
Glenna Schaillee


Landlords




 
 
and
 
Heather Delage                                                                                                                    Tenant
 
 
 
Gerben Schaillee
and Glenna Schaillee (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Heather Delage (the 'Tenant') because the Landlords intend to demolish
the rental unit. The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on November 17, 2021.
 
The Landlords, the Landlord's Legal Representative, James Moak, the Tenant and the Tenant's Legal Representative, Kat Ying,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant does not dispute that the Landlords
require the rental
unit to be vacated in order to demolish it.
 
2.    
It is also not disputed that the Landlords have given the Tenant 3 months’ rent compensation as required by the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
 
3.    
I am satisfied that the Landlords
have obtained the necessary permits
for this work.
 
4.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find that it would
not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2022 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
5.    
The Tenant testified
that she would be undergoing surgery on December 14, 2021 and would require
8 weeks to recover. She therefore requested
until March 31, 2022 to move.
The Tenant testified that he is on
ODSP, suffers from health issues, and has not
had any success in finding a new place. However, the Tenant has known for
approximately 12 months that the Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit
and the length of the




 
proceedings has
afforded her time to explore her options. The Landlords have already suffered
financial losses and may face potential liability from the township if the
residential complex is not demolished. Balancing the interests and
circumstances of the parties and considering that the enforcement of the order
may take some time, it would be unfair to delay the eviction
to March 31, 2022 (Peel
Non-Profit Housing v. McNamara,
[1990] O.J. No.364). However, I do find it appropriate in the circumstances to
postpone the eviction to January 31, 2022 to afford the Tenant additional time
to make alternate arrangements.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated, as of January 31, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $14.80
per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 12, 2022 to
the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing on or before January
22, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 23, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 1, 2022.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act,

this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
