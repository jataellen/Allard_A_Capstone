Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-91208-18
 











 
 
 

P.M.L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict L.C.(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 application)
 
P.M.L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict L.C.(the 'Tenant') because he has been persistently late
in paying his rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2 application)
 
This application was heard in Toronto on July 17,
2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing. 
 
The Tenant appeared late in the
morning and after the matter had proceeded as uncontested.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent he was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2018 to July 31,
2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 25, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,189.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 1, 2011 to April 25, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant paid $3,268.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2 application
6.     
The Tenant has paid her rent
persistently late. The Landlord provided a ledger sheet at the hearing
confirming that the Tenant has paid the rent late 10 times in the past 12
months.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 28,
2018.
2.     
As of the date of this
order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent
deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled
to by $353.71*.
3.     
However, the Landlord is
authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes
the Tenant:
$43.20 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 18, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     
The Landlord or the Tenant
shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before July 28, 2018, then starting July 29, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
6.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 29, 2018.
7.     
If, on or before July 28,
2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,762.50** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after July 29, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
L2 application
9.     
If the Tenant voids the
eviction order for non-payment of rent pursuant to paragraph 7 or 8 above then
the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord new rent on time and in full on the 1st
of the month for the period commencing August 1, 2018 to July 31, 2019. 
10.  
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph 9 of this order the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pays any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that became owing after July 31, 2018.
