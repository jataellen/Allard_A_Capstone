Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-26002-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


5, 16 THIRTY FIRST
STREET ETOBICOKE ON M8W3E9


 




Between:


Michael Boguslawski


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nelson Rapaso


Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Boguslawski (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nelson Rapaso (the 'Tenant')
and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on March 10, 2021 with respect to application
TSL-17476-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition
specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $882.30 rent on
or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$9,009.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TSL-17476-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $480.25 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order TSL-17476-20 is
cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from March 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from May 1, 2015 to
January 26, 2022.
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    
Order TSL-17476-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
3.     As of the date of this order, the Tenant owes no money
to the Landlord because the amount of the rent deposit
and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit
exceeds the arrears of rent, that the Landlord is entitled to under this
order by $160.64.
 
4.     The Landlord is authorized to offset the following
amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$29.01 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit;
 
5.    
The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other
any sum of money that is owed as a
result of this order.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.

The tenant has until February 5, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 5, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 7, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
