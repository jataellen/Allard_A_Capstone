This amended order is issued to correct a clerical error in
the original order issued January

683867 Ontario Corp. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Amber-lea Teal and Dale Drakes (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that
the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 8, 2021. The Landlord’s Agent Amy Man and the Tenants attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 23, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
vacated the rental
unit on October 31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent was
$1,615.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,615.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January
1, 2020 to August 23, 2021.
