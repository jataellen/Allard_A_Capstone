In the matter of:      403, 722 JOHN COUNTER BOULEVARD
KINGSTON ON K7K6N9
 
Between:                  Skyline Living                                                                                                Landlord
 
 
and
 
Karen Mainprize                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
 
 
Skyline Living (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Karen Mainprize (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 7,
2021 with respect to application EAL-95464-21.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved by order EAL-97705-21, issued on October
14, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order EAL-97705-21.
 
This motion was heard by video conference on January 7, 2022. The Landlord’s Agent Brad
Casnaw and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord applied for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on September 7, 2021 with respect to application
EAL-95464-21.
 
2.       
The Landlord claims that on
September 7, 2021, the Tenant’s guest entered the residential building
without a face mask. The relevant condition
is paragraph 1 of the mediated agreement, which states:
 
The Tenant, any occupants and/or
guests shall wear a facemask at all times when in the common areas of the residential complex
for as long as this policy
exists.
 
3.       
The parties understood the condition
meant that the Tenant would ensure
that her guests wear masks in the building. The Tenant lives with a disability, and her source
of income is disability benefits. She testified
that she cannot compel her guests to actually wear face masks but can merely
insist that they do so. She cannot afford to supply her guests with face masks
on her budget. She stated that she has taken all reasonable steps to comply




 
with the conditions of the
order, including (i) insisting to her guests that they wear a face mask in the building, and (ii) providing face masks to them when they enter the building,
if she has them available. She testified that she did so on the incident
date.
 
4.       
I
find that, on the balance
of probabilities, the Tenant has not substantively breached the condition
of the agreement. Rather, I am satisfied that she has made her best effort to
comply with the condition. Therefore, the motion to set aside the order is
granted.
 
5.       
Pursuant to O.Reg.364/20 (Rules
for Step 3 and Roadmap Exit, as of September 2021) and O.Reg.263/20 (Rules for
Step 2, current), the onus is upon the person responsible for a building that
is open to the public to ensure that any person inside the premises wears a properly fitting
mask or face covering unless
the individual entering
the premises is exempt from
wearing a mask under the regulations.
 
6.       
The municipality of Kingston has
put into place By-Law 2020-068 and Order stating that “every person
shall wear a face covering while
in any enclosed common
area” in a multi- residential complex, which includes apartment buildings.
Consistent with the regulations,
owners of the residential complex
must ensure that all persons
in the common area wear a face covering. Owners must post a
copy of the requirement in the building for visitors and residents to read. While the Landlord did not present
these documents as evidence, there
is no question that they exist and may be relied upon by residents and business
owners.
 
7.       
There is a joint responsibility of
the Landlord and the Tenant in ensuring that the regulations and the by-law are followed.
I note that these laws do not provide for disability
accommodation with respect of the ability of a person living with a disability
being able to understand and/or strictly comply with the rules. The concept of
joint responsibility, then, results in the benefit to a landlord and a tenant
of working together to ensure the face mask requirement is met.
 
8.       
It is undisputed that wearing a
face mask as required during the Covid-19 pandemic is critically important to the health
and safety of individuals, among
other considerations. At the hearing, the parties mutually
agreed to an order varying or replacing the conditions set out in Order
EAL-95464-21, to facilitate future compliance.
 
9.       
I was satisfied that the parties
understood the consequences of varying or replacing the terms of the order. As
a result, the terms of the previous order EAL-95464-21 shall be varied and a
new order issued: paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 shall be amended in accordance with the
terms below. Paragraph 2 of the Order EAL-95464-21 will remain in force.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The motion to set aside Order EAL-97705-21, issued
on October 14, 2021 is granted.
Order EAL-95464-21 is cancelled and replaced with the following.
 
2.       
Commencing on January
1, 2022 and until June 1,
2022, the Tenant, any
occupants of the Tenant’s rental unit and guests of the Tenant
shall not walk their dog(s) through the front entrance of the building.




 
3.       
For the duration of the time period that the Government of Ontario recommends or requires that individuals wear face masks during the
Covid-19 pandemic,
 
(i)       
the Tenant shall wear a face mask in the common
areas of the building,
(ii)      
the Tenant shall ask her guests in advance- before they visit-
to bring and wear a properly fitting face mask before or at
the time they enter the building, unless the guest is not required to wear a mask for medical
reasons, or any other reason
set out in section 2(4) of Ontario Regulation 263/20), and
(iii)    
the Tenant shall inform her
guests, with as much notice as possible in advance, that if the guest does not wear a face mask when he/she/they enters the building, the guest will not be allowed
into the building.
 
4.       
In a situation where the Tenant’s
guest is required
to wear a mask and the
Tenant knows that the guest is
entering the building without wearing a mask, the Tenant shall immediately
contact the Landlord or the Landlord’s designated property manager or
superintendent by telephone, text message or email to inform the Landlord that
she has informed her guest of the need to wear a mask, of any refusal by that
guest to wear a mask, and that the guest is intending
on entering the building. In such a case, the Tenant
shall also refuse the guest’s visit.
 
5.       
The Landlord shall document
the incident in paragraph 4 above, in writing and provide a copy to the Tenant in a timely manner.
 
6.       
If a guest of the Tenant informs
the Landlord or Landlord’s agent that he/she/they is exempt from wearing a mask, the Landlord shall
not refuse permission for the person
to enter the building but may remind the person of the social distancing
policy of the Government of Ontario as it relates to common areas of the
building.
 
7.       
Commencing on February 1, 2022, the Tenant shall pay the $186.00 application filing fee to the
Landlord or Landlord’s agent in the amount of $20.00 per month, and shall
include this amount with her regular monthly rent payments as follows:

8.       
If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing in paragraph 7, above, on or
before November 1, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from November 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
9.       
If the Tenant fails to meet any of the terms in
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, above, the Landlord may apply under s.78 of the Act, without
notice to the Tenant, for an order
terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make
this application no later than 30 days after the Tenant fails to comply with
the condition.
 
10.    The Landlord shall
forthwith review this order with the Tenant,
or arrange for a tenant support person, to review the
order with the Tenant, to promote compliance with the terms.
 
11.    The Landlord shall provide the Tenant with written
notice of any changes to face mask requirements as they occur. The notice shall
include a plain language description of the changes, the dates the changes are to occur and the responsibilities of the
Tenant, if any.
