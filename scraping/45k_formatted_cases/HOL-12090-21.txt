Tenant




 


Christine Veraldi


 



 
 
 
Sanamdeep Bawa
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christine Veraldi (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord has entered into an
agreement of purchase and sale of the rental
unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard by video conference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord,
the Landlord's Legal Representative, R. Bent and the Tenant attended the
hearing. The Tenant spoke with Duty
Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Section 49 (1) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (‘Act’) provides that a landlord of a
residential complex that contains no more than three residential units who has
entered into an agreement of purchase and sale of the unit, may, on behalf of
the purchaser, give the tenant of the unit a notice terminating the tenancy, if
the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
2.    
On September 26,
2021, the Landlord served the Tenant with a Notice to End your Tenancy Because
the Landlord, a Purchaser, or a Family Member Requires the Rental Unit (N12)
with a termination date of December 6, 2021. The Landlord indicated in the
notice that the purchaser of the rental unit intends to move into the unit. The
declaration of the purchaser dated
September 13, 2021 indicates that they intend to reside in the unit for no less
than a year.
3.    
The Landlord testified that the
initial closing date for the sale of the unit was December 17, 2021 but since the unit was not vacant,
the date was moved.
The Landlord provided a copy
of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale
dated September 3, 2021, as evidence, and




 
further testified that a second purchaser
was added to the agreement
hence it was amended
in November 2021 to reflect the change.
 
4.     The Landlord also stated that the new closing date for
the sale is February 5, 2022, and due to the inability of the Landlord to close
the sale on December 17, 2021, the Landlord incurred hotel and storage costs of
$5,000.00 in compensation to the purchaser. The Landlord provided as proof of
his assertions, an email exchange between his lawyer and that of the purchaser
showing the purchaser asking for $5,000.00 in compensation as well as stating
that the new closing date will be February 5, 2021. The parties did not
sign an amended Agreement of Purchase and Sale reflecting the new closing date.
 
5.     The Landlord stated that he has no relationship with
the purchaser and assumes they reside in the province currently. The Landlord
agrees that the purchaser did not view the unit until it was purchased.
 
6.     On December 5, 2021, the Landlord paid $1,850.00 to the Tenant in lieu of compensation for having served the
Tenant with the notice of termination.
 
7.     The Tenant, who has resided in the unit since February
2019, testified that the notice of termination was given in bad faith because her relationship with the Landlord
deteriorated over non-payment of rent and the denial of the Landlord’s request
to terminate the tenancy following a hearing of the Landlord’s application on
the issue.
 
8.     The Tenant further testified that the rental unit was
purchased without a viewing on the same day it was placed on MLS, without a
‘for sale’ sign in front of the unit. The Tenant also alleged that the unit was
sold for less than the market value, and there is currently still a ‘coming for
sale soon’ sign in front of the unit.
 
9.    
The Tenant is actively seeking
alternative accommodation and due to bidding wars and requests for a six-month
rental deposit, the Tenant has been unable to find a suitable unit. While the Tenant currently pays rent
of $1,850.00 for the unit, similar units go for between $2,800.00 to $3,000.00.
 
Analysis
 
10.  The courts have provided significant guidance to the
Board in interpreting the “good faith” requirement” contained in the Act.
 
11.  In Feeny v. Noble,
1994 CanLII 10538 (ON SC), 19
O.R. (3d) 762 (“Feeney”), the
Ontario Divisional Court made a decision under a similar provision in
subsection 103(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. L.7, and held that:
 
“…the test of good faith is a genuine
intention to occupy the premises
and not the reasonableness of the landlord’s proposal”.
 
12.  In Salter v. Beljinac, 2001 CanLII 40231 (ON SCDC),
[2001] O.J. No 2792, the Divisional Court revisited the “good faith” requirement under subsection 51(1) of the Tenant




 
Protection
Act, 1997, S.O. 1997, c. 24. The
Court referred to Feeney, supra, and held that:
 
“…the legal standard for the
Tribunal as finder of fact remains the same under s. 51(1) of the TPA as seen in the case
law interpreting s. 103(1) of the LTA.
 
13.  More recently, in Fava v. Harrison, 2014 ONSC 3352 (CanLII) (“Fava”), the Divisional Court, in considering the good
faith requirement in s.48(1) of this Act, determined as follows:
 
“We accept, as reflected in
Salter, supra, that the motives of the landlord in seeking possession of the
property are largely irrelevant and that the only issue is whether the
landlord has a genuine intent to reside in the property. However, that does not mean that the Board
cannot consider the conduct and the motives of the landlord in order to draw
inferences as to whether the landlord desires, in good faith, to occupy the
property.” [emphasis added].
 
14.  Thus, the Board is entitled to enquire into the
motives and conduct of a landlord in determining the issue of good faith and to
draw inferences about the landlord’s intentions based upon the totality of the
evidence presented.
 
15.  In this case, the Landlord did produce a declaration
from the purchaser as well as the Agreement of Purchase and Sale showing the
unit was sold with a closing date of December 17, 2021. Based on the emails
between the lawyers on or about December 17,
2021, the closing date was moved to February 5, 2022. Given that the Landlord
testified that he has no relationship with the purchaser, I find it highly
unusual that there is no amended Agreement of Purchase and
Sale containing the new closing date.
 
16.  In addition, the parties agree that the purchaser did
not view the unit before the sale, and the Tenant states that there is still a
coming for sale sign in front of the rental unit. This raises doubt in my mind
on whether this is not an arms length transaction, which would mean the Landlord was not entirely truthful in his testimony, or the sale fell
through hence there is no amended
Agreement of Purchase and Sale. If
the Landlord was untruthful, the
notice of termination was likely not given in good faith. If the sale fell
through, then there is no Purchaser who in good faith requires possession of
the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation for a period of at
least one year. As I am not satisfied with the evidence as presented by the
Landlord, I must deny the Landlord’s request to terminate the tenancy.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is
dismissed.
 
2.     The Tenant shall reimburse the Landlord $1,850.00 for
the compensation paid by the Landlord.




 
3.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing on or before March 25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 26, 2022 at 2%
annually on the balance outstanding.
