Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Haleigh
Woodward


Tenant



 
 
 
Regent Properties (london) Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tenant because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on October 18, 2021.
 
At 10:15
am the Landlord’s Representative Corrie
Sanford (CS) and Heather
Phenix (HP) the Landlord’s
Witness attended the hearing. The
Tenant did not attend the hearing nor was represented.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
2.     The rental unit is a 3-story townhouse
which the Tenant
has occupied since 2015.
 
3.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,421.87 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
4.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 27, 2021 to August 11, 2021.
 
 
N5 Notice of Termination and L2 Application:
 
5.    
On or
about July 22, 2021, the Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice of
Termination (N5 notice)
alleging that the Tenant or someone living with the Tenant has




 
wilfully or
negligently damaged the rental unit or the
residential complex. Specifically, the Landlord alleges that the
unit is “very dirty and broken” including broken and missing kitchen cupboard
doors and drawers,
damage to front door, dust in furnace,
filthy carpets, broken closet
and bedroom doors and walls,
mirror and towel holder missing
in bathroom, unsanitary
conditions in bathrooms, garbage in unit and backyard.
 
N5 Notice – Wilful or Negligent Damage
 
6.     Section
62(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) states
that:
 
A landlord may
give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the
rental unit or the residential
complex. 2006,
c. 17, s. 62 (1).
 
(2)   A notice of termination under this section
shall,
(a)     provide
a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after
the notice is given;
(b)    
set out the grounds
for termination; and
(c)     require the tenant,
within seven days,
(i)    
to repair the damaged
property or pay to the landlord the reasonable costs of
repairing the damaged property, or
(ii)     to replace the damaged property
or pay to the landlord
the reasonable costs
of replacing the damaged property, if it is not reasonable to repair the
damaged property.
 
7.    
Section 62(3) of the Act also provides the tenant with an opportunity to void the N5
notice if:
 
…the tenant, within seven days after receiving the notice, complies
with the requirement referred to in clause (2) (c) or makes arrangements satisfactory to the landlord to comply
with that requirement.
 
8.    
I find that the N5 notice served on the Tenant is invalid
as it fails to advise the Tenant how to void the notice.
 
9.    
In the N5 notice, the
Landlord indicated the reason for the
notice as someone visiting or living
with the tenant has wilfully
or negligently damaged the rental unit or the residential
complex. The N5 notice allows the Tenant
to void the notice by correcting the problems
described in the notice but fails to advise the Tenant how to correct the
problem.
 
10. 
In my view, the N5 notice
served on the Tenant
is confusing as it does not provide
the Tenant with any details as to how to actually void the notice.
 
11.  I find on a balance
of probabilities that the confusing
nature of the N5 notice significantly frustrates the
Tenant’s ability to fully and properly correct the issues that gave rise the notice
of termination. Accordingly, the
Landlord’s application is dismissed.




 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1. The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
