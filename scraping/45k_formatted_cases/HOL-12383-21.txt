Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12383-21



In the
  matter of:


669, 365-6 ALBERT
STREET WATERLOO ON N2L0G7


 




Between:


Accommod8u Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Vincenzo Rispoli


 
Tenant



 
 
Accommod8u Inc. (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Vincenzo Rispoli
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The Landlord also claimed administration
charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 1, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Gayle St. Clair, attended the hearing. As of 4:01 p.m. the
Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from August 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective October 6, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on November
30, 2021. The Tenant was in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $2,069.00.
4.    
The Tenant has made no payments
since the application was filed.
5.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,965.55 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     The NSF charges claimed by the Landlord related to
preauthorized withdrawals or automatic debiting rather than NSF cheques. Since subsection 87(5) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, does not provide a remedy for a preauthorized
withdrawal or automatic debit that fails due to non-sufficient funds, the
Landlord’s claim for NSF charges is denied.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of November
30, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.

owing and compensation up to November 30, 2021, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 27, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
