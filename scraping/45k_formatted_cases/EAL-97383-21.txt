Bindu Tuteja

Tenants



 
 
 
608598 Ontario Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Bindu
Tuteja and Rohit (kumar) Tuteja
(the 'Tenants') because
they, another occupant
of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered
with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord or another tenant. ; because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of purchase
and sale of the rental unit and the
purchaser requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential
occupation
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021 at 10:57 AM.
 
The Landlord’s agent, George Koutros,
and the Tenant,
Rohit (Kumar) Tuteja,
attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Anna
Katyk.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
On August 30, 2021, the
Landlord served the Tenants an N12 Notice of Termination under section
49 of the Act because
a purchaser’s child
wants to move into the rental
unit.
 
2.    
Section 49.1 of the Act
states that, “a landlord shall compensate a tenant in the amount equal to one month’s
rent or offer the tenant another rental
unit acceptable to the tenant if
the landlord gives the tenant a notice of termination of the tenancy under
section 49”.
 
3.    
Section 55.1 of the Act
requires that compensation under section 49.1 be paid to the tenant no later
than on the termination date specified in the notice of termination. In the
present case, the termination date in the N12 Notice
of Termination is October 31, 2021.
 
4.    
Section
83(4) of the Act states that “[t]he Board shall not issue an eviction order in
a proceeding regarding termination of a tenancy
for the purposes
of residential occupation,
. . . until the landlord
has complied with section … 49.1. . .”.




 
5.    
The
Tenant claims to have received no compensation in accordance with this
requirement. It is the Landlord’s position that the rent due September 2021 was waived, and that this satisfies the
foregoing compensation requirement.
6.    
This Board
has accepted that a waiver
of rent may satisfy the compensation requirement (see TEL-12372-20,
EAL-93846-21-AM, as cited by the Landlord). Nevertheless,
the circumstances of this matter force me to conclude that the Landlord has not
complied with the compensation requirement.
Statutory compensation
7.    
On
August 27, 2021, the Landlord’s lawyer, Anna Katyk, wrote an e-mail to the
Tenants, which included the following notice: “Please note that under the
recent amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, you are entitled to one‐month’s rent which will be provided to you by e‐transfer by no later than
October 31, 2021. Please tell me which email address you prefer to receive the
e‐transfer on and I will inform my client.” The Tenants advised of their preferred
e-mail address for an e-transfer on August 29, 2021. It is uncontested that no e-transfer was sent.
8.    
On
October 3, 2021, George Koutras, the Landlord’s representative, e-mailed the
Tenants and wrote, in part, “I have not yet received your rent for September 2021 nor the rent for October 2021 (the last rent payment received was for August 2021). Please sent an e-transfer
right away.”
9.    
The
Tenants replied later the same day, part of their reply reading: “On August
27th, 2021 we received a 2nd N12 from Anna attached.
As you already had one month deposit therefore did not send rent in
September 2021. October 2021 rent payment will be sent shortly. If things have
changed during last few months, and N12 is no longer valid then please let us
know and we will send an additional monthly rent payment.”
10. 
Mr. Koutras’
reply the next day read, in part, “As for the N12 that Anna sent you nothing
has changed (still valid and proceeding).”
11. 
No further
evidence of the communication relating
to the compensation was introduced as evidence.
12. 
The
Landlord however takes the following position in an affidavit of George
Koutras, sworn on December 8, 2021: “On October 3, 2021 the Tenants informed me
that they were withholding rent for September 2021. Consequently, the Tenants
were compensated before the termination date of October
31, 2021 when they withheld rent payment for the month of September,
2021 in anticipation of the hearing.”
13. 
The Tenant indicated having no previous
knowledge of the September rent being waived as attempted compliance with the Landlord’s statutory compensation requirement. They first heard of this when served with the affidavit. No evidence suggests otherwise, other than
the Landlord attempting to typify the preceding e-mail exchange as implicitly
doing so. I cannot accept the
Landlord’s position that the preceding e-mails in any way expressly or
implicitly do so.




 
14. 
I am
prepared to accept that an unambiguous and unequivocal waiver of rent due or
rent owing that is made prior to a termination date contained in an N12 may
satisfy the Landlord’s compensation requirement in the sections noted above, as
such an act confers compensation in
the form of valuable consideration equal to one month’s rent upon a tenant. But in this instance, the Landlord made no
effort to articulate this position prior to the termination date. The net effect is no different than if the
Landlord had selected the box on the L2 application indicating that they will provide
compensation prior to the termination date, then failing
to deliver a cheque until some time after that deadline.
The late cheque would be defective termination. A late waiver ought to be treated no differently.
15. 
I
believe this interpretation is consistent with the finding of Member McVicar in
EAL- 90727-20, a previous order of this Board raised by the Tenants, who held
(at para 6) “I would have found that section 55.1 of the Act had been
satisfied, but the forgiveness would have had to be express and have occurred
on or before May 31, 2021.” It is
also consistent with past orders issued by me in relation to defective
compensation through waiving rent or arrears (e.g., EAL-94763-21, CEL-00985-21, TEL-17410-21), namely that all acts of the Landlord to give
effect to the compensation must be completed prior to the termination
date.
16. 
I
therefore find that the Landlord did not comply with the statutory compensation
requirement described above prior to the termination date on the notice of
termination. The Landlord made no express
waiver until the affidavit of December 8, 2021, after the
termination date had passed.
Exercise of discretion under s.
190(2)
17. 
The question
therefore turns on whether I might exercise
any discretion afforded
to me by
s. 190(2)
of the Act to extend the deadline
for the payment of compensation contained in
s. 55.1, and allow the compensation to be paid after the termination date contained in the
N12.
18. 
Upon consideration of the submissions made to me, I am electing not to exercise
any discretion afforded under s. 190(2) to extend the deadline given in
s. 55.1.
19. 
The statutory requirement that the Landlord pay compensation within a defined
timeframe is unambiguous, and a measure designed to protect a Tenant. The Tenant is entitled to the protections
provided by the Act and not required to demand that the Landlord respect their
statutory obligation relating to compensation.
If the Landlord is to rely upon giving compensation by way of a
“credit”, the Landlord ought to be held to strict performance of completing
that act prior to the termination date.
20. 
An
inchoate intention of a Landlord to provide compensation by a statutory
deadline ought not be forgiven by the discretionary powers under s. 190(2). To do so would make a mockery of the tenant protections
contained in the Act, and would potentially allow intention, rather than
action, to be the standard of compensation being properly given. Setting aside
such a mandatory statutory requirement should be the exception, not the rule.




 
21. 
I note
that in my order in CEL-99786-21, I considered circumstances in which the
exercise of discretion might be appropriate, suggesting as follows when I might
exercise this discretion: “In deciding whether
to exercise my discretion to extend the deadline I find
it appropriate to consider (a) whether the Landlord made reasonable efforts to
compensate before the termination date, and (b) whether the Tenant frustrated
the Landlord’s reasonable efforts.” I
do not consider that either element of these conjunctive circumstances have
been met: the Landlord frankly made no reasonable efforts to clarify its
position to the Tenant prior to the termination date, and there was no act or
omission by the Tenants to prevent the Landlord from completing their statutory
obligations, for example declining an e-transfer (see TEL-17408-21). I see no other factors present that would
justify expanding this helpful (but admittedly non-exhaustive) test.
22.  For the reasons
noted above, I do not consider it appropriate to exercise discretion under
s. 190(2) in this instance. Return of compensation
23. 
With
that said, the Landlord has expressed a view that the unambiguous waiver of the
rent in the affidavit mentioned above was intended to be an irrevocable conferral of value
on the Tenants, and implied that the affidavit was intended to make the amount
beyond recovery. Under section
73.1 of the Act, the Board may order the return of compensation
paid to a Tenant if the Board refuses to grant an eviction order but where
compensation has been given (whether properly or effectively) in an attempt to
comply with section
49.1. The Tenants
conceded that the September rent had not to the hearing date been
paid. While the Landlord’s
compensation may be defective, it is entitled to its return.
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlords $1,319.00, which was given by the Landlords in the form of a rent abatement for the month of September 2021 in attempted satisfaction of the required compensation under s. 49.1.
