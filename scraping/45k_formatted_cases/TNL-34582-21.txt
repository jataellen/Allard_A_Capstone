Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-34582-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


BASEMENT, 262 TAMPA
DRIVE KESWICK ON L4P3T7


 




Between:


Elena Gower
  Ian Gower


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Christine Wilson Kent Canning


Tenants



 
 
 
and Elena Gower and Ian Gower (the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Christine Wilson and Kent
Canning (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises and used the rental unit or the residential
complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and
that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 988 4914 7021# on January
6, 2022. The Landlord Ian Gower, and the Tenant Christine Wilson
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
Kent Canning
has vacated the rental unit and no long resides
with Ms. Wilson.
 
2.    
Mr. Canning owned the
vehicle claimed was damaging the grass. As
he no longer resides in the unit, I find it would inappropriate to terminate the tenancy of Ms. Wilson
for this issue.
 
3.    
The Landlords
claim that painting
a table caused damage. There is no evidence that damage has been caused to the rental
unit.
 
4.    
The Landlords also
claim that cultivating marijuana has caused damage. The Tenant testified that there is no marijuana in the rental
unit that is being cultivated and that she has no intention cultivating in the
future.
 
5.    
I find the tenancy
should not be terminated based
on the notice and the circumstances.




File Number: TNL-34582-21
 
6.    
At the hearing the
Tenant agreed that should Kent Canning attend the residential complex she will inform
the Landlord and ask him to leave. The Tenant
also agreed that she will not permit Mr. Canning into
her rental unit.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Landlords' application is dismissed.
