Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57638-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


853 LANARK
CRESCENT SARNIA ON N7S4E3


 




Between:


Shane Jefferies


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amanda Bressette
  Tyler Hammond


Tenants



 
 
 
Shane Jefferies (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tyler Hammond and
Amanda Bressette (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued
by the Board on January 17,
2022 with respect to application SWL-57213-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The
Tenants did not pay $1530.00 rent on or before January 1,
2022. The Tenants did not pay $823.20 arrears on or before
January 14, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or
some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $4,116.00 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-57213-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,322.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SWL-57213-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,530.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from January 1, 2020 to February 3,
2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-57213-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 14, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,907.62*.
(Less any amounts paid since the filing of the application on January 20, 2022.)
This amount represents the rent owing up to February 3, 2022 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall
also pay to the Landlord
$50.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 4, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
14, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 15, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 14, 2022, then starting
February 15, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 15, 2022.
