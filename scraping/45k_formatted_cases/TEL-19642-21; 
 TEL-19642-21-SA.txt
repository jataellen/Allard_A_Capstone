and


 




 


April
Foster


Tenant



 
 
 
1966780 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict April Foster (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
June 9, 2021 with respect to application TEL-07604-19.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order TEL-19642-21, issued on October
14, 2021. The Tenant filed a
motion to set aside order TEL-19642-21.
 
This motion was heard
by videoconference on December 21, 2021.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Ian MacInnis, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
At the motion hearing
the parties agreed
to terminating the tenancy February
28, 2022 on the condition that the Tenant paid to
the Landlord $6,362.01, consisting of arears to December 31, 2021 ($4,749.40)
and January rent ($1,612.61), by January 2, 2022.
 
2.   
The parties
also agreed that if the Tenant did not make the above noted payment,
then the set aside motion
would be denied, and the stay of the order would be lifted immediately.
 
3.   
On January
4, 2022 the Landlord's Legal Representative emailed
the Board to advise that the
payment of $6,362.01
due January 2, 2022 was not made; the Tenant
did not pay any
amount towards the arrears or January rent.
 
4.   
Therefore, based on the above, and pursuant to my Direction dated December 29, 2021,
the set aside motion is denied and the stay will be lifted immediately.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order TEL-19642-21, issued on October14, 2021, is denied.
