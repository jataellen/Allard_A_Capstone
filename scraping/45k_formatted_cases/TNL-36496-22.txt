Sanassi Antonio Moore


Tenant



 
On November 28, 2021,
Amstar Pool I LP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sanassi
Antonio Moore (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent he owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on
October 5, 2020 with respect to application TNL-25382-20 SA.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$400.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards arrears of
rent.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenant
to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered to pay
$9,081.28 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order TNL-25382-20 SA. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $2,981.28
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order TNL-25382-20 SA is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order,
the Tenant has also failed
to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021.
 
6.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,350.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.




File Number: TNL-36496-22
 
7.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
February 2, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TNL-25382-20 SA is
cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 13, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $3,153.05*. This amount represents the rent owing up to November 30, 2021 and
the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.27 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of
the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 13, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 14, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 13, 2022, then starting February
14, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 14, 2022.

The tenant has until February 12, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 12, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of
the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on August 14, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
