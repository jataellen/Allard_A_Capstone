Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-24029-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


68, 6767
THOROLD STONE ROAD NIAGARA FALLS ON L2J3W9


 




Between:


Predrag Radovic
  Stefan Radovic


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Brandon Schaefer
  Summer Schafer


Tenants



 
Predrag Radovic and Stefan
Radovic (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brandon
Schaefer and Summer Schafer (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 25, 2022. The Landlord, Stefan Radovic, the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Daniel McDonald, and the Tenant’s
Agent, Lynn Murray, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective April 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $969.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $969.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 15, 2016 to
April 22, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on
the parties and whether the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until March 1, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $16,473.80*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $31.86
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from March 2, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$17,643.00 if the payment is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)         
$18,612.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 28, 2022
ii)       $19,581.00 if the payment is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the Tenants do not make full
payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline,
then the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
