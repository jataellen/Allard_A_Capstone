Mason Allison


Tenant



 
 
Review Order
 
Frontenac Property
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and evict
Mason Allison (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was resolved by order EAL-95763-21 issued on October
4, 2021. On October 17, 2021,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request
was heard by videoconference on January 14, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal
representative P. Kyte attended the hearing. As of 1:21pm, the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board. The hearing concluded at 1:33pm and by that time the Tenant was
still not in attendance.
 
Determinations:
 
Review
 
1.    
The Landlord’s request for a review
is based on the ground
of being not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings.
 
2.     The hearing that gave rise to the order under
review took place on July 13, 2021. The
Landlord did not send any representative and the application was dismissed as abandoned.

3.    
At the review hearing the
Landlord’s legal representative testified that he was in other Board hearings
when this matter
was heard. He was not familiar with the zoom platform
and did not sign in to the hearing.
 
4.     Based on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence I find
that the Landlord was not reasonably able to participate in the proceedings. The Board must be flexible
with parties and
representatives who wish to participate in the proceedings but encounter
barriers because of their unfamiliarity with the technology.
 
5.     I granted the Landlord’s request
for a review and the L1 application proceeded de novo.
 
L1 application
 
6.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February
10, 2021.
 
7.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
8.     The monthly rent is $834.90.
 
9.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $834.90
from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the
Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order EAL-95763-21 issued
on October 4, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 5, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,899.35*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 25, 2022, plus NSF charges, less the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.45
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 26, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.

5.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 6, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$7,068.90 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,903.80 if the payment
is made on or before
February 5, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 6, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
