Tenants



 
 
Joy Ondiaka and Nicholas Ondiaka
(the 'Landlords') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Michael Noszenko and Melissa Noszenko (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September

Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlords could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenants
have not met the following condition specified in the order: the Tenants did not pay the lawful rent for December on or before December 1, 2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 25, 2022.
 
2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 25, 2022, then starting January
26, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
