Review Order
 
Bhupinder Grewal and Jaskaran
Dharmait (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Natasha Hemraj (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was resolved
by order CEL-01239-21 issued on October
25, 2021.
 
On October 28, 2021, the Tenant
requested a review of the order alleging that she was not reasonably able to participate in the hearing because
she did not receive the Notice of Hearing.
 
On November 3, 2021, the Board issued interim
order CEL-01239-21-RV-IN staying
the order issued on October
25, 2021.
 
The Tenant’s request was heard by way of video conference on January 18, 2022. The Landlord,
Jaskaran Dharmait (‘JD’), the Landlords’ Legal Representative, John Lambe, the
Landlords’ Witness, Jennifer Lambe, and the Tenant attended the hearing. The Tenant spoke to Tenant Duty Counsel
prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Tenant’s Request for Review
 
1.       
The Tenant testified that she never
received the Notice
of Hearing for the Board hearing
held on September 10, 2021. The
Tenant testified that this is not the only government mail that she has not
received. The Tenant said that on at least 3 other occasions, she did not
receive government mail that was sent to her or her son.




 
2.       
The Tenant testified that had she
received the Notice of Hearing, she would have attended the scheduled hearing
because she wants the Board
to understand her financial
situation that has impeded her ability to pay the monthly rent to the
Landlords.
 
3.       
The Landlords’ Representative
called his Witness to provide evidence. However,
the evidence provided by the Witness did not speak to whether the Tenant
received the Notice of Hearing.
The Landlords’ Representative submitted that no one will really know if
the Tenant received the Notice of Hearing and that it is “anyone’s guess”.
 
4.       
Based on the evidence before me, I
find on balance of probabilities that the Tenant did not receive the Notice of Hearing
which resulted in her inability
to reasonably participate in the hearing held on
September 10, 2021. I say this because the Landlords did not present evidence
which reasonably challenged the Tenant’s evidence that she never received the
Notice of Hearing.
 
5.       
The Tenant’s request to review is granted.
 
New Hearing
of the Landlord’s L1 Application
 
6.       
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant
was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective July 5,
2021.
 
7.       
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
8.       
The lawful monthly rent is $2,300.00.
 
9.       
The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $2,300.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
10.    Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September
1, 2020 to July 5, 2021.
 
11.    The Tenant agreed that she has not made any payments to the Landlords
since the application was
filed.
 
12.    The parties agreed that the amount owing to the
Landlords is $27, 786.00 for the rental period
ending January 31, 2022. This amount is inclusive
of arrears of rent ($27,600.00) and the cost ($186.00) for
filing the application.
 
Relief from Eviction
 
13.    The Tenant lives with her 3 children
ages 20 years, 15 years,
and 11 years.
 
14.   
The Tenant testified that she has
not paid the rent owed to the Landlords because she cannot afford to do so. When she moved into the rental unit, she
was supposed to have assistance from
her friend, fiancé, and her son’s girlfriend to pay the monthly rent. A short time after they all moved into the
rental unit, her friend, fiancé, and son’s girlfriend left.




 
15.   
The Tenant testified that her monthly
income is approximately $1,817.00 (Child Tax Credit + Trillium payment). She also received
$252.00 every three months
for GST rebate.
 
16.    The Tenant has no other source of income. She has not made payments towards the
monthly rent because the limited
income she receives
is spent on her children,
groceries, and public transportation.
 
17.    The Tenant testified that she wants to stay in the
rental unit as she has no place to go. She wants to repay the arrears of rent to the Landlords
but has no concrete plan or ability to do so currently.
 
18.   
The Tenant testified that if she had to move out of the rental unit, she would need until April 1, 2022 to find new housing.
 
19.    The Landlords’ Representative submitted that the Landlord has reached out to the Tenant
several times by way of text message to discuss repayment of the arrears. The last time the Landlord reached out was
on October 10, 2021. The Tenant never
responded to the Landlords’ messages. The Tenant did not dispute the Landlords’
Representative’s submissions on this issue.
 
20.    The Landlords’ Representative submitted that the Landlords are small landlords and the arrears of
rent are significant. The Tenant has
no ability to pay the rent or the arrears and as such, the eviction should be
granted.
 
21.    I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of COVID-19 and whether the Landlord
attempted to negotiate repayment of the arrears, and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. In making this finding, I considered the
evidence of the Tenant which confirms that the tenancy is not viable as her
monthly income is less than the monthly rent.
The Tenant’s evidence further supports my finding that relief from
eviction is not appropriate in this matter as the Landlords would be
significantly prejudice because the already significant arrears of rent will
continue to accumulate.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Tenant’s request for review is granted.
 
2.       
Order CEL-01239-21 issued on October 25, 2021 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:

Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before

The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $22,848.92*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 24, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords
$75.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 25, 2022
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
6.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated

10.    The Tenant may make a motion to the Board

period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
