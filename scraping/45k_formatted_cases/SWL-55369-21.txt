Jason Knox


Tenant



 
 
 
Diya Rashmawi (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jason Knox (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, Timothy Mobberley, attended the hearing. As of
2:13 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective September 18, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on October
18, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $766.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord is not holding
a last months rent deposit.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
18, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$2,172.70*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 18, 2021.




File Number: SWL-55369-21
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
