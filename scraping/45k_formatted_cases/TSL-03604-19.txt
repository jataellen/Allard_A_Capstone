2287987
O.L. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict P.G.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1
Application)
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with
the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant (L2 Application). 
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on April 17, 2019.
 
Only
the Landlord’s representatives, A.D. and S.P., attended the hearing.
            
Determinations:
 
L1 Application – Rent arrears
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2019.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 19, 2019.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of
the rental unit. 
3.      The monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $265.00.
4.      The
Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
L2
Application 
6.      The
Landlord served the Tenant with an N5 Notice of Termination (‘N5 notice’) on January
4, 2019. The N5 notice indicates that the grounds for the notice are
substantial interference. The N5 notice indicates that the Tenant may void the eviction
by ceasing the behaviour complained of in the N5 notice in the seven days after
the N5 notice is served. The voiding period is January 5, 2019 to January 11,
2019, inclusive.
 
7.      The
N5 notice sets out details as to the reason the Landlord has served the N5
notice. These details include that the Tenant harassed another tenant by
calling him “mental,” and by leaving the water running in the shared washroom. 
 
8.      AD
is an employee of the Landlord. At the hearing AD testified that to the best of
his knowledge the allegations in the N5 notice are true.
 
9.      At
the hearing AD submitted a copy of a complaint from a tenant who lives on the
floor beneath the shared washroom of the rental unit. The complaint is dated
January 8, 2019 and states that on January 8, 2019 the tenant on the floor
below noticed water leaking from his ceiling and that the cause of the leak is
the water being left running in the sink in the shared bathroom above. The
writer of the letter states that he knows it is the Tenant who has done this
because the Tenant has a history of engaging in this behaviour. 
 
10.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant ran the water excessively in the shared washroom
on January 8, 2019 and that this behavior substantially interfered with another
tenant. I therefore find that the Tenant did not void the N5 notice.
 
11.   Based
on the Landlord’s uncontested evidence I am satisfied, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Tenant has engaged in the conduct complained of in the
N5 notice. I therefore find that the Tenant has substantially interfered with
another tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the premises. 
 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the rent arrears portion of this eviction order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before May 7, 2019.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,010.40*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to April 26, 2019.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $8.71 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 27, 2019 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before May 7,
2019, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 8, 2019 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before May 7, 2019, then starting May 8, 2019,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 8, 2019.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void the arrears portion of this order and continue the
tenancy (until May 7, 2019 when the tenancy will be terminated based on the L2
Application for interference with others) the Tenant must pay to the Landlord
or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,250.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2019, or
ii)       $1,515.00 if the payment is made on or before May 7, 2019**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the arrears portion of this order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after May 8, 2019 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
