Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
NOL-43939-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
A205, 1290 BANCROFT DR DRIVE SUDBURY ON
  P3B4C8


 




Between:


Three Seasons Investments Ltd.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Sadie Dagle


Tenant



 
 
 
Three Seasons Investments Ltd. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sadie Dagle (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only the Landlord's Agent, Anna Vilano attended the hearing. As of 10:18 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 18, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
As of January 1, 2022, the monthly
rent for the unit is
$1,064.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     
The Tenant paid $4,158.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.      I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact
of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the
Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until
February 20, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. The Tenant has
been making payments to the Landlord. The arrears are not
significant. Postponing the eviction will allow time for the Tenant to pay the
amount required to void the order or move out.




File Number: NOL-43939-21
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.     As of the date of this order,
the amount of the rent deposit exceeds
the arrears of rent
and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $102.40*.
 
3.     However, the Landlord
is authorized to offset the following amounts
from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$34.98 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit, and
$186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
 
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
6.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
7.     If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$448.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022,
or
ii)             
$1,512.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 20, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act
to set aside this order if
they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after February 21, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
