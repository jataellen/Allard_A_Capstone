Lukas Gudrunas


Tenant



 
241 Lloyd Street Holdings
Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Lukas Gudrunas (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative,
Angie Gravelle, attended the hearing. As of 1:55 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total
rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
July 1, 2021 to August
31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice
of Termination effective July 30, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on August
31, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $899.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $899.00
from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from September 1, 2020 to July 30,
2021.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of August 31, 2021, the date the Tenant
gave vacant possession of the
rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-43681-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $929.77*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to August
31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 15, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
