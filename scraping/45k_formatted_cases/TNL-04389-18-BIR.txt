            Order under Section
21.2 of the 
Statutory Powers Procedure Act 
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-04389-18-BIR
 
 
TC
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict VLT
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was resolved by order TNL-04389-18 issued on September 20, 2018.
 
On
September 25, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of the order. The Tenant’s
request was denied by order TNL-04389-18-RV issued on September 26, 2018.
 
On
October 10, 2018 the Vice chair of the Eastern Region ordered that there be a
Board Initiated Review of order TNL-04389-18-RV.
 
The
Board initiated review was heard in Toronto on October 18, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, RA, the Tenant and the Tenant’s
representative, KW, attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Vice Chair of the Toronto North region determined, in order TNL-04389-18-RV,
that the Tenant had a reasonable opportunity to participate in the hearing of
September 20, 2018 and therefore denied the Tenant’s request for review.
 
2.      The
Tenant has lived in the rental unit for approximately 20 years. Her mail is
delivered through a mail slot in her front door. She has not had issues about
receiving her mail during her tenancy, although she does occasionally get mail
addressed to other people in her mail slot.
 
3.      The
Tenant’s adult children have access to the mail that is delivered to the
Tenant’s home. 
 
4.      It
is the Tenant’s practice to pick up the mail from the floor where it lands
after being dropped through the mail slot, and place it on a nearby table. She
sorts through the mail once or twice a week.
 
5.      The
Notice of Hearing was mailed to the Tenant by the Board on August 14, 2018. It
was not returned to the Board as being undeliverable. 
 
6.      I
accept the Tenant’s evidence that the Notice of Hearing did not come to her
attention. I can only surmise that the Notice was delivered to the Tenant’s
home but got mislaid before she opened it.
 
7.      Given
the length of the tenancy and given the prejudice to the Tenant of not
permitting her to make submissions about a S. 83 payment plan (as requested by
her in the Request for Review), I concluded that the review should be allowed
and the Landlord’s application should be heard de novo.
 
8.      The
Tenant does not agree with the RGI allocation and credits given to her by the
Landlord. That is not a matter which can be dealt with by the Board.
 
9.      The
Tenant proposed a payment plan to which the Landlord agreed.
 
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Order
TNL-04389-18 issued on September 20, 2018 is cancelled and replaced by the
following:
 
2.       The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,270.00, which represents the amount of rent
and costs owing up to October 31, 2018 as follows:.
 
a)    $1,500.00
on or before October 22, 2018
b)    $160.00
on or before the first business day of each month from November 2018 to and
including September 2020
c)    $90.00
on or before the first business day of October 2020.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord the monthly rent from November 2018 to
and including October 2020, on or before the first business day of the month
for which the rent becomes due.
4.      If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 2 of this order, together with
simple interest, calculated from the day after default, at 3.00% annually on
the balance outstanding, shall become immediately due and owing and the
Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant and requiring that the Tenant pay any new arrears, NSF fees and related
charges that become owing after the date of this order.
