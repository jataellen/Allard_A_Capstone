Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80084-17
 










 
 
 

M.M. (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict J.P. and M.P.
(the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on May 24, 2017.
 
The
Landlord’s daughter and agent, R.S., and the second-named Tenant above attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      There
is no dispute between the parties that the Tenants have not paid the total rent
they were required to pay for the period from February 1, 2017 to May 31,
2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 27, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants paid $1,500.00 after the application was filed. As a result, the arrears
of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017 total $3,900.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and is entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
only real issue between the parties is the Tenants’ request for relief from
eviction in the form of a conditional order containing a repayment plan. The
Tenants want to remain in the rental unit and repay the arrears of rent in
instalments.
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to impose on the Landlord the repayment plan requested, but
it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until June 30, 2017 pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act. I say this for the following reasons.
6.      This
is a new tenancy. It began in October of 2016. The rental unit is a farm house.
There is a barn on the property where the Tenants have horses. 
7.      The
Tenant who attended the hearing says that he was in receipt of Employment
Insurance benefits which ran out earlier than he anticipated resulting in the
Tenants falling behind in the rent. He also says that three months prior to the
hearing he obtained new employment and makes about $4,000.00 to $5,000.00 a month.

8.      His
spouse, the first named Tenant, works two part-time jobs until school end when
one of her jobs also ends. So until the end of June she makes about $2,000.00 a
month; after that her income drops to about $1,000.00.
9.      The
Tenants have two children ages 13 and 9 years old who are home schooled. The
Tenants receive a monthly child tax benefit of $806.00. 
10.   The
Tenant estimates the household monthly expenses other than rent total
$3,500.00. 
11.   What
this means is that since the end of February, 2017 the Tenants have had a total
monthly income of $7,306.00. After monthly expenses the Tenant should have had
$3,806.00 available every month to pay the rent. The monthly rent is $2,500.00.
But they are currently in arrears of rent. When the Tenant who attended the hearing
was asked why the Tenants are in arrears of rent given this income profile, the
Tenant essentially indicated that the Tenants had other bills to pay. His truck
broke down and needed to be repaired, and they were catching up on other bills.

12.   The
Tenants produced no corroborating documentary evidence with respect to income
or expenses. 
13.   The
Landlord is 85 years old. The rental unit is part of the family farm and she
used to live there until it was unmanageable for her. She currently resides
independently with her 92 year old sister in a small house in the city. She has
no savings to speak of and is reliant on pension income from the government to
make ends meet. The Tenants’ non-payment has caused her a great deal of stress.
Her children occasionally have helped out by paying for things like her phone
bill. 
14.   Recently,
the Board heard another application between these parties filed by the Landlord
seeking termination of the tenancy. That application is contained in Board file
TEL-79321-17.
In Board order TEL-79321-17 issued June 1, 2017, the Board grants the
Landlord’s application but delays eviction until August 31, 2017. 
15.   Given all
of the above I am not prepared to grant the Tenants the relief requested. 
16.   I say this
primarily because the Tenants’ evidence with respect to their income is not
credible. 
17.   If the
Tenants were making as much as they say they did for the period in question
then it is difficult to understand why they are in arrears of rent to the
extent that they are. Further, the Tenants should have been able to produce
documentary evidence in support of their evidence with respect to income and the
expense associated with the truck but did not do so at the hearing. I draw a
negative inference from that lack. Finally, even if accept the Tenants’
evidence with respect to their income and expenses it appears they have chosen
to privilege other expenses and bills over the rent. That is a choice tenants
are entitled to make but the prejudice it causes a landlord is a factor the
Board takes into account; it is part of the Board’s purpose to uphold the
rights of both landlords and tenants and that includes the landlord’s right to
collect rent. 
18.   That being
said the presence of horses on the property means that the Tenants will
probably have to find a stable where they can board them. That will take
additional time for the move. Given this fact, the financial and emotional
pressures the Landlord is facing, and the Tenants’ alleged income profile, it
seems to me that it would not be unfair to give the Tenants until June 30, 2017
to pay the Landlord what is owed or move. An order shall issue accordingly.
19.   The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,500.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is
owing to the Tenants for the period from September 29, 2016 to April 27, 2017
totalling $21.67. If the Tenants do not void the eviction order below by paying
the amount outstanding then this deposit and the interest owing on it shall be
applied to the rent arrears owing. 
20.   This
order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further
reasons shall be issued.
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before June 30, 2017.
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,556.35*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to June 2, 2017, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $82.19 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting June 3, 2017 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
13, 2017, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 14, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 30, 2017, then starting July 1, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2017.
8.      If,
on or before June 30, 2017, the Tenants pay the amount of $6,575.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to
set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on
or after July 1, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
