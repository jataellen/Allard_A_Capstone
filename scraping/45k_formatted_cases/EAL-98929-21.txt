Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-98929-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


15 ELM STREET EAST SMITHS FALLS ON K7A3S6


 




Between:


Aaron Macdonald Ainslee Macdonald


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Nikki Wilson


Tenant



 
 
On November
10, 2021, Aaron Macdonald and Ainslee
Macdonald (the 'Landlords') applied for an
order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nikki Wilson (the 'Tenant') and for an
order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on September 28,
2021 with respect to application EAL-96182-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed
to pay to the Landlord
$935.00 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent. The Tenant paid $65.00.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent.
The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the
arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $5,796.00 for rent arrears in Order EAL-96182-21. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $4,610.00 and that amount is included
in this order. As a result,
the previous order EAL-96182-21 is cancelled.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order EAL-96182-21 is cancelled.




File Number: EAL-98929-21
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlords and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 16, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlords $5,480.00*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlords $30.74
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 1, 2021
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords
the full amount
owing* on or before January
16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before January
16, 2022, then starting January
17, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 17, 2022.

The tenant has until January 15, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 15, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 17, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
