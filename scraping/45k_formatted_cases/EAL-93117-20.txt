Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-93117-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


116, 31 BAYSWATER PLACE KINGSTON ON K7M2B8


 




Between:


Osgoode Properties


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Peter Johnson


Tenant



 
 
Osgoode Properties (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Peter Johnson (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on November 24, 2021 at 10:17am. Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Anne Skelly. Also in attendance was the
Landlord’s witness, Megan Wheatley.
Determinations:
 
PRELIMINARY ISSUE
 
1.     At the hearing on November 24, 2021, William Florence,
a lawyer with the Kingston Community Legal Clinic, interrupted the proceedings
on at least two occasions in attempts to advocate
for the Tenant who was not present
at the hearing; he advised
that he had been working with the Tenant on other matters against the
Landlord.
 
2.     WL indicated that on August 19, 2021, the legal clinic
wrote to the Board requesting access to all active applications with respect to
this tenancy; WL admitted there was no reference on this request
to specific file numbers. The Board’s records
did not then, and still do
not, show a record of this request.
 
3.     After I inquired with WL more than once regarding his
present status on this file, he confirmed that he had not been retained to
represent the Tenant on this application before the Board on November 24, 2021
nor did he receive any instructions from the Tenant in regard to this file. This is confirmed by the agency
authorization form submitted














 

to the Board on November 25, 2021 (the day after the hearing)
where it appears
the Tenant has signed an authorization form allowing the legal clinic
access to his file.
 
4.     I proceeded to hear the matter uncontested and
directed WL to cease from interrupting the proceedings as his own evidence confirmed that he was not a party to the application.
 
L2 APPLICATION
 
5.    
By way of background this is a month-to-month tenancy
in which rent is due on the first of the month in the amount of $879.06.
The tenancy commenced four years ago and the Tenant is the sole occupant of the
rental unit.
 
6.     The Landlord’s L2 application is based on a first N5
notice of termination served to the Tenant on December
7, 2020 with a termination date of December
27, 2020 pursuant
to subsection 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.
 
7.     As this was a first N5 notice of termination, the Tenant had seven days
to void the notice by
correcting the behaviour complained of on the notice of termination. This
remedy period was between December 7 -15, 2020.
 
8.    
The Landlord testified that the
Tenant did not void the N5 notice of termination as the Tenant failed
to provide proof
of insurance by the end of the remedy period.
Thus, I find the Tenant did not void the N5 notice of termination and I
proceeded to hear the Landlord’s claim for termination of the tenancy based on
substantial interference.
 
9.     The Landlord’s witness, Megan Wheatley (MW), who is an
employee of the Landlord testified that part of her job includes going through
tenants’ paperwork to ensure their insurance information is current in the
Landlord’s files. MW conducts this task on a monthly basis and has been trying
to obtain this information from the Tenant for the past
1.5 years without success.
 
10.  MW testified that on October 17, 2020, she wrote to
the Tenant requesting proof of insurance but did not receive a response from
the Tenant; a second letter was sent on November 3, 2020 seeking
an update on the request
made on October 17, 2020 but once again, no response was received from
the Tenant. A final letter was sent on November 18, 2020 requesting a copy of
the policy or a letter from the insurance agent with specific particulars – MW testified that the Tenant failed
to response to this letter
as well. As such,
the Landlord resorted to the issuance of the N5 notice of termination. A copy
of these letters was submitted into evidence.
 
11.  MW testified that she has also had many face-to-face conversations with the Tenant and that he is aware h needs to provide
one but has failed to follow-through.
 
12.  The Landlord submitted a copy of the Tenant’s lease
agreement which commenced on June 1, 2017, and which
states, at section
36, the following and is initialled by the Tenant:




 
 
 
 
13.  The Landlord also submitted a copy of the Tenant’s
insurance policy that took effect
on June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018 confirming coverage during this period.
 
14.  The Landlord seeks a termination of the tenancy and
submits that by failing to keep an updated insurance policy and by failing to provide this information to the Landlord
when requested, puts the Landlord’s
insurance policy at risk and makes the Landlord liable in any adverse
incidents. The Landlord
submits that they have provided
ample opportunity to the
Tenant to provide this information prior to commencing legal proceedings.
 
15.  Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I find
that the Tenant has substantially interfered with the Landlord's lawful rights,
privileges or interests of the Landlord; I say this as the Landlord had a
lawful right to require the Tenant to provide proof that he has the requisite
tenant insurance in full force and effect upon request
of the Landlord at any time. The Landlord also demonstrated
that it requested the required proof on multiple occasions: once in October
2020 and twice in November 2020. The Tenant’s failure or refusal to provide
requested proof of insurance coverage served as a complete interference with
that lawful right.
 
16.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be
unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify
relief from eviction.
The Landlord attempted to work with the
Tenant to help him improve the cleanliness of the rental unit and remove his
unwanted guests, but the Tenant stopped cooperating.
 
17.  This order contains
all of the reasons for my decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
December 27, 2020. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $10,887.30 (less
any amount paid by the Tenants to the Landlord after the application was filed
with the Board), which represents compensation for the use of the unit from December 28, 2020 to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$28.90 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from February 9, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 20, 2022.
