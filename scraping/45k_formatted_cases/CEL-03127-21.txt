Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03127-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


2, 240 CLAYBORNE PLACE ORILLIA ON L3V1M5


 




Between:


Glen O'Brien


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Paula Morrison
  Terry Morrison


Tenants



 
 
 
Glen O'Brien (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Terry Morrison and Paula Morrison
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 24, 2022. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Teri Landriault, attended the hearing. As of 10:13 a.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The L1 application is amended to correct the arrears owing from $1,022.00 to $2,044.00
for the period from October 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination
effective September 30, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.    
The lawful monthly rent is $1,022.00.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,000.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent deposit
has been paid to the Tenants for the period from November
1, 2018 to January 31, 2022.
 
7.     The Tenants paid $372.00 after the application was filed.




 
8.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 19, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlord $5,073.60*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$33.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
19, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 20, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 19, 2022, then starting February
20, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 20, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 19,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $6,968.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 20, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
