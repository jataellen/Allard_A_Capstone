Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: EAL-73495-18
 










 
 

Landlord’s L1 application.
S.E. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.F. and R.R.(the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
Landlord’s L2 application.
S.E. (the 'Landlord') also
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict M.F. and R.R. (the
'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the
Tenants permitted in the residential complex have seriously impaired the safety
of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
These applications were heard
in Belleville on June 7, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended
the hearing. J.M. who also lives in the building attended as a witness for the
Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L1 application, the
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective April 6, 2018.
2.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $975.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2017 to April 6, 2018.
4.     
The Tenants paid $1,474.00
after the application was filed.
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
6.     
With respect to the
Landlord’s L2 application, an
N7 notice was given to the Tenants on April 21, 2018 for interfering with the
safety of another person.
7.     
The majority of the items
listed on the notice had nothing to do with the safety of others and in fact
dealt with reasonable enjoyment which is not a part of an N7 notice as
presented.
8.     
The notice also did not
include proper dates and no times.
9.     
In Ball v. Metro Capital
et al, the Divisional Court has ruled that a notice is void for a lack of
details. It stated that a tenant needs sufficient information to know the case
that has been brought against him in order for him to be able to take the
necessary steps to correct the problem or to be able to defend himself from the
accusations.
10.  
As this is the case in this
notice I have dismissed the notice as void.
 
11.  
The L2 portion of the
application is dismissed.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before June 23,
2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $21.67*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up
to June 12, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $32.05 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting June 13, 2018 to the date they move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 23, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June
24, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 23, 2018, then starting June 24, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 24, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before June 23,
2018, the Tenants pay the amount of $1,791.25** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy
would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in the unit.  If this
payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after June 24, 2018
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are
only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
