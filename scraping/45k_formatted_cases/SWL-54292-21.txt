Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54292-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


105 ASHBURY AVENUE LONDON ON N6E1T3


 




Between:


Basel Dabbagh


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mohammad Al Amour Shoroq Abo Arah


Tenants



 
 
 
Basel Dabbagh (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mohammad Al Amour and Shoroq Abo Arah (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. The
Landlord, the Landlord's Representative, Saad Dabbagh, the Tenant, Mohammad
Al Amour, and the Tenant's Legal Representative, Anas Alian,
attended the hearing. The Tenant's
Legal Representative spoke on behalf of both Tenants.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,720.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,720.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
5.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from February
28, 2019 to December 31,
2020.
 
6.     The Tenants paid $1,720.00 after the application was filed.




 
7.    
The Tenants indicated that they have 5 children
ages from infant
to 8 years old and have
been living in the rental unit since 2019. The
Tenants indicated that they also have filed their own T6 application regarding
maintenance that will be heard at a later date.
 
8.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $7,427.86*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February
10, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$56.55 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 11, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2022, then starting March 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenants pay
the amount of $10,506.00** to the Landlord or to the Board
in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
