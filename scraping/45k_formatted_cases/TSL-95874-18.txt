V.W. (M.S.) I. C.R.M.P.(the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict S. F.H. (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit
after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on
July 6, 2018.
 
The Landlord and the
Tenant attended the hearing. The Landlord was represented by M.Z.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. 
2.     
The Tenant says she is not
entirely sure that the Landlord’s ledger is accurate but she did not present
any evidence to contradict what it says so I accept the ledger sets out the
pattern of late payment that has occurred here. 
3.     
During the 12 month period from
June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018 the Tenant was late paying the rent 9 times out of
12 months. After notice of termination for persistent late payment was served
on the Tenant she paid most of the rent due June 1, 2018, in advance with a
shortfall of $1.56. That shortfall was paid July 1, 2018 when July’s rent was
also paid on time and in full. So in the 14 month period starting June 1, 2017
the Tenant was late paying the rent in full 10 times. 
4.     
As a result, I am satisfied
the Tenant has been persistently late paying the rent. 
5.     
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
grant relief from eviction subject to the conditions set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
6.     
I say this because the Landlord does not seek an
eviction order. It merely wants the Tenant to pay rent on time into the future.
The Tenant says she can do that and she demonstrated that by paying rent on
time July 1, 2018. 
7.     
As a result an order shall issue requiring the
Tenant to pay rent on time and in full for the next 11 months. If she breaches
that obligation the Landlord will be entitled to obtain an eviction order under
s. 78 of the Act without a hearing or prior notice to the Tenant. 
8.     
The only real dispute
between the parties is with respect to the Landlord’s filing fee. The Landlord
incurred costs of $175.00 for filing the application and seeks an order
requiring the Tenant to pay the Landlord that amount. The Tenant resists such
an order.
9.     
Part of the reason that the
Tenant resists the Landlord’s request for an order requiring her to pay the
filing fee is that the Landlord wrote her a letter on May 7, 2018 that
understandably created some confusion. The letter had attached to it an N4
notice of termination setting out the rent arrears owing for the month of May,
2018. The Tenant voided that notice by paying the amount required by the
termination date.
10.   Unlike the notice of termination attached to it,
the letter was not just about rent arrears. It says in part:
According to
our records you have been paying your rent consistently late. Please be advised
that rent is due on the 1st business day of each month.
Starting June
1, 2018 if the rent is not paid on time, we will serve you an N8 and start the
L1 application with the courts. Please make sure you are paying your rent when
it is due on the first of the month to avoid legal costs and/or eviction. This
is the final notice. 
11.   The Tenant quite reasonably interprets this
letter to mean that no notice of termination for persistent late payment of
rent would issue nor would legal costs be incurred if she started paying rent
on time by June 1, 2018. (That being said, the Tenant says she did not pay
June’s rent in advance, less the $1.56 shortfall, because of this letter;
rather that amount was paid because she happened to have it on hand due to when
her pay date falls.) 
12.   Despite the Landlord’s letter, on May 17, 2018
it issued a notice of termination for persistent late payment and filed this
application on May 25, 2018. So the Tenant was not given until June 1, 2018 to
rectify matters after all and she feels that is unfair. The Tenant understands
her obligation to pay rent on time and understood it before receiving the
notice of termination but believes that the Landlord’s letter is sort of an
offer to settle that she accepted by paying rent on time. 
13.   The usual approach of the Board towards the
issue of costs is set out in the Board’s Interpretation Guideline 3 on Costs.
It says in part:
In most cases,
the only costs allowed will be the application fee. This should be ordered if
the applicant is successful in obtaining an order which allows the relief they
asked for in the application, or substantially all of that relief.
14.   In this case the Landlord has established the
Tenant has been persistently late paying rent meaning it has succeeded in
establishing it is entitled to the relief it sought. So the Interpretation
Guideline supports the assertion the Landlord is entitled to an order for the
filing fee.
15.   That being said, the Board’s power to order
costs including the filing fee is discretionary and the Interpretation
Guideline is not binding on Board Members. That means that I have the power to
refuse to order the costs be paid if doing so would not be unfair and
inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. 
16.   The Tenant’s reasons for not wanting to pay the
filing fee are not limited to the letter from the Landlord of May 7, 2018. She
cannot easily afford it and she has a disabled son, which I took to mean it
would be a struggle to pay it. 
17.   It seems to me that this would be one of the
very rare instances where refusing to order the Tenant to pay the Landlord’s
cost of filing the application would be consistent with the purposes of the Act
and not unfair. 
18.   I say this because the evidence indicates that
prior to May 7, 2018 the Landlord never warned the Tenant she was at risk of
eviction or legal costs for persistent late payment. The letter the Landlord
wrote May 7, 2018 was her first warning and it does read like an offer to
settle: pay rent on time starting June 1, 2018 and you will suffer no costs or
consequences. The Tenant essentially accepted that offer through her behaviour
so it does seem unfair that the Landlord not be held to its offer. 
19.   The Act says in part that the purposes it is
intended to serve include balancing the rights and responsibilities of
landlords and tenants, and providing for the adjudication of disputes and for
other processes to informally resolve disputes. The Landlord’s letter was an
informal way of resolving the Landlord’s dispute with the Tenant and the Tenant
accepted it. The Board should promote and approve of that kind of informal
dispute resolution as long as it is fair and not in breach of the Act. 
20.   Given all of the above, I decline to order the
Tenant to pay to the Landlord its cost of filing the application. 
21.   This order contains all of the reasons for the
decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.
It is ordered that:
1.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord new rent on time and in full for the period August 1, 2018 to June 30,
2019.
2.     
If the Tenant fails to make
any one of the payments in accordance with this order, the Landlord may, within
30 days of the Tenant's breach and without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant.
