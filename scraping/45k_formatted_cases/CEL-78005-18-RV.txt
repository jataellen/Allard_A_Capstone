Tenancies Act, 2006
 











 
 

Review Order
 
JV (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict CC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent
that the Tenant owes (CEL-78005-18).
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-78005-18
issued on September 11, 2018.
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the
rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage (CEL-78470-18).
 
This application was resolved by order CEL-78470-18
issued on September 14, 2018.
 
On October 3, 2018, the Tenant requested a review of
the orders CEL-78005-18 and CEL-78470-18.
 
The request was heard in Orangeville on November 5,
2018.
 
The Landlord and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
Pursuant to subsection
198(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Board may
direct that two or more applications be joined or heard together if the Board
believes it would be fair to determine the issues raised by them together.
2.     
Accordingly, although the L1
and L2 applications were heard separately, the request to review the resulting
orders is joined and heard together.
Tenant’s request to review Order CEL-78005-18
and CEL-78470-18
 
3.     
The Tenant has to go to the
post office to retrieve his mail. He said a roommate who moved out had the
mailbox key and he was delayed in retrieving his mail and did not receive the
notices of hearing for both applications.  The Landlord did not dispute the
Tenant’s evidence.
4.     
Although the Tenant ought to
have been more diligent in arranging to retrieve the mailbox key, I am
satisfied that the Tenant was not reasonably able to participate in the
hearings on September 10th and 18th, 2018.
Regarding L1 rent owing application (CEL-78005-18)
5.     
The Tenant does not dispute
the amount of rent owing. 
6.     
He said is he able to pay
the rent arrears by November 30, 2018.
7.     
The Tenant has paid
$1,100.00 to the Board in Trust.
Regarding L2 damage application (CEL-78470-18)
8.     
I heard the Tenant’s
response to the findings regarding damage to the carpet and closet door in the
rental unit. 
9.     
The Tenant testified that
the carpet is at least twenty five years old and that he steam cleaned it.  The
Tenant admitted to removing carpet which was damaged by his dogs.  The Tenant
also said the carpet was not properly installed and secured with quarter round
which led to fraying and increased wear and tear.  The Tenant also disputes
that the Landlord is required to replace the underlay as well as the carpet. 
10.  
In response to the photo of
damage to the closet door, the Tenant said he did not kick in the door but nudged
the door with his knee because it was difficult to open.
11.  
The Landlord testified that
the house was custom built with new carpet and all the doors were aligned at
the commencement of the tenancy.  The Landlord also said the carpet installers
would not warranty the carpet replacement without replacement of the underlay
and the quote submitted for the carpet is the same type of carpet currently
installed.
12.  
I prefer the evidence of the
Landlord regarding the carpet replacement. It was supported by photos and
quotes.  The Member took into account the age of the carpet in paragraph six
(under Determinations) in order CEL-78470-18.  The Tenant admits to removing
carpet which his dogs damaged.  
13.  
As set out in paragraph 10
of order CEL-78470-18 (Determinations section), the photo indicates that the hole
in the door appears to be caused by “ripping out or kicked out”.  It is
therefore improbable that the damage was caused as claimed by the Tenant.
14.  
Therefore I agree with and
adopt the findings in order CEL-78470-18 as follows:
a)   
The N5 Notice was sent to
the Tenant via priority post and it was not returned by Canada Post to the
Landlord as unclaimed. I find the Landlord has met her obligation to serve the
notice of termination. 
 
b)   
The Tenant is still living
in the rental unit as of the date of this hearing according to the Landlord. 
c)   
The Landlord inspected the
rental unit on June 15, 2018 and found damages to the carpet, baseboard, window
trim, entrance steel door and weather stripping, two closet doors and railing.
The Tenant did not correct the problem within the time period set out in the
Notice of Termination.
d)   
The Tenant has negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit by completely
removing the carpet in the living room, shredding/fraying the carpet on the
stair landing; and having stained and excessively dirtied the carpet in the 2
bedrooms. The Landlord testified the Tenant has two dogs that likely caused the
damage. The Tenant according to the Landlord also had a crow that was left
uncaged and it defecate at will in the unit. 
e)   
I find the Tenant negligently
caused undue damage to the carpet to the degree that goes beyond normal wear
and tear and ordinary cleanliness. 
f)    
The Landlord provided a
quote from Home Depot for replacement costs and work to install new carpet
covering an areas of 1125 square feet at $3.57 plus taxes for a total of
$4,538.36. The carpet was at least five years old before the Tenant moved in
2011 which makes it at least 12 years old. I find it fair that the Tenant pay
half the replacement costs of $2,269.18 given its age and to some degree
deterioration caused by normal wear and tear. 
g)   
The photographs presented by
the Landlord shows dirt and marks on the baseboard. The Landlord is seeking
replacement costs of $1,400.00 for the baseboards which is not reasonable. The
baseboards are not damaged. The photographs depict dirt and minor scuffs which
can be reasonably repaired by cleaning and painting them. 
h)   
The window trim (about an
inch in length about a few centimeters wide) is slightly detached from the
window. It appears the trim is unglued and the defect is minor that it is not
considered undue damage. On a balance of probability, the trim detached likely
due to its useful life/age and/or due to normal wear and tear.  
i)    
The metal door has slight
dents which does not interfere with the integrity and normal use of the door.
The weather stripping on the door is frayed approximately 5 inches along the
bottom side of the door which on a balance of probability was caused by the
Tenant’s dogs as it looks chewed in the photograph. The Landlord did not
provide a breakdown between the costs to repair the weather strip on the door. 

j)     
The Tenant negligently
caused undue damage to the closet door because there is a large hole, the size
of the entire bottom panel that appears to likely have been ripped out or
kicked out. The Landlord obtained a quote from a contractor and replacement
costs and work for two doors is $400.00. The Tenant owes the Landlord $200.00
for one door.  The Landlord did not provide post-hearing submission with
photographs of the missing door as requested at the hearing. The Landlord did
not provide enough evidence about the missing closet door in the other bedroom.
k)   
The railing which consists
of a piece of wood about 1.5 inches in width became detached and has a crack
that runs along the panel that is about two feet in length. The photo shows
black tape around the joint holding it in place.  I am not persuaded that the
Tenant wilfully or negligently caused damage to the railing. The replacement
costs are unreasonable since the railing is a makeshift railing. 
l)     
The Tenant owes the Landlord
a total of $2,469.18 ($2,269.18+$200.00).
m) 
The cost of the application
is not granted since the Tenant has already been ordered to pay the costs for
application CEL-78005-18. The Landlord could have filed this application along
with the L1 application CEL-78005-18 that was heard the same day as this
application.
Relief from eviction
15.  
If evicted, the Tenant
requests a delay of termination to April 2019.  The Tenant lives with two other
adults and three dogs.  He has lived in the unit for approximately nine years.
16.  
The Landlord seeks final
termination of the tenancy.
17.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act and find
that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.  There is significant damage to multiple areas of the rental
unit likely caused by the Tenant’s dogs and the arrears are substantial.  There
was no evidence from the Tenant despite his admission that carpet was removed
because his dogs damaged it that any steps would be taken to prevent further
damage to the unit.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenant’s request to
review is granted. 
2.     
Order CEL-78005-18 issued on
September 11, 2018 and order CEL-78470 issued on September 17, 2018 are varied
in the following manner:
3.     
The “It is ordered” section
of orders CEL-78005-18 and CEL-78470 are replaced with the following:
4.     
The tenancy between the
Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before December 2, 2018.
5.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,924.06*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to November 21, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit and less the amount paid to the Board in trust.
6.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $36.89 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November
22, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
7.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
8.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 2, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from December
3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
9.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before December 2, 2018, then starting December 3, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
10.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after December 3, 2018.
11.  
The Board shall pay to the
Landlord the amount of $1,100.00 together with any accrued interest.
