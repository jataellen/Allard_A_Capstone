Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-91104-18
 











 
 
 

J.E.L.(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict S.G. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on June 6, 2018,
and August 30, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative,
G.P., and the Tenant attended the hearing. 
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent she was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2017 to August
31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective April 19, 2018.
2.     
The outstanding arrears
owing for the period ending August 31, 2018, total $2,515.56.  
3.     
The Landlord paid $190.00
for the costs of filing the application and the Landlord is entitled to be
reimbursed for those costs. 
4.     
The Tenant has paid
$3,092.37 to the Board in trust since the application was filed. **
5.     
The Tenant paid $1,018.57 to
the Landlord after the application was filed.
6.     
The Tenant disputes the
amount of outstanding arrears owing to the Landlord. On the first day of
hearing, the Tenant provided the Board with enough evidence to suggest that she
may be able to establish that the Landlord’s calculations were incorrect. I
then adjourned the matter to allow the Tenant time to gather additional
evidence, provide that evidence to the Landlord and come better prepared for
the next hearing date. 
7.     
On the second hearing date,
the Tenant provided the Board with a package of receipts which she had also
previously disclosed to the Landlord. There is no dispute that the Tenant pays the
monthly rent by using money orders made out to the Landlord. 
8.     
As the Landlord’s
representative correctly points out, the Tenant’s receipts are not money order
receipts but are automatic bank machine receipts. The receipts are unclear and
contain various anomalies. For example, some of the receipts contain duplicate
amounts, some receipts are actually duplicates themselves, some repeatedly say
“debit memo” and some receipts say “debit memo correction”. The Tenant could
not provide an adequate explanation for these irregularities. 
9.     
These receipts do not
confirm that the Tenant withdrew money orders, gave the money orders to the
Landlord and then had the Landlord deposit the money orders. Without copies of
the original money orders, or bank records confirming this information, it is
not clear whether the Tenant actually delivered each money order to the
Landlord or that the Landlord received the money orders and cashed them. Instead,
it appears that the Tenant may have withdrawn some money orders from her
account, but then deposited them back into her own account. In short, these
receipts do not support the Tenant’s testimony that the Landlord’s calculations
are incorrect. 
10.  
In addition, the Landlord’s
staff went through each individual receipt and cross-referenced them to the
Landlord’s ledger. On multiple occasions, if the Tenant’s receipts are
accurate, the Tenant actually paid money to the Landlord that was not owed. If
the receipts are accurate, they show that, on at least one occasion, the Tenant
paid over one thousand dollars to the Landlord even though she only owed
approximately $5.00. This suggests to me that the contents of the receipts is
not reliable and they do not support the Tenant’s position regarding the amount
of arrears. 
11.  
Based on the evidence before
me, I am satisfied that the outstanding arrears are as per the Landlord’s
ledger and update sheet. 
12.  
At the hearing, once I
determined the amount of outstanding arrears was correct, I heard testimony
from the Tenant regarding her monthly income and expenses. After a detailed
discussion, it became clear that the Tenant cannot afford to live in the rental
unit and her monthly income is not expected to increase in the foreseeable
future. The Tenant is suggesting that I order a re-payment plan to pay the
arrears. However, as the Tenant cannot afford the monthly rent, I find that she
also cannot afford a re-payment plan. 
13.  
The Tenant lives alone in
the rental unit and has lived there since 2008. The Tenant says she has been
looking for another place to live, but she has been unsuccessful so far. The
Tenant is asking for a delay of the eviction until September 30, 2018, so allow
her time to find suitable accommodations. The Tenant suffers from various
medical conditions for which she takes medication. 
14.  
The Landlord’s
representative is seeking a standard eviction order because he says it will
take several weeks to enforce the eviction order and this delay should provide
all the time the Tenant requires to find another place to live. 
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'). I have considered that this is a long-term
tenancy and the Tenant suffers from various medical conditions. I have also
considered that the Tenant has paid her rent into the Board in trust for the
last three months which means the arrears have not increased substantially
since the application was filed. I find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until September 30, 2018, pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. This short delay should provide the Tenant with adequate time to find
alternate accommodations. 
It is ordered that:
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before September
30, 2018.The amount of $3,092.37 plus accrued interest shall be paid out to the
Landlord.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $2,736.07*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to September 7, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $33.41 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
September 8, 2018 to the date she moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before September 18, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
September 19, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before September 30, 2018, then starting October 1, 2018, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 1, 2018.
8.     
If, on or before September
30, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $3,742.23** to the Landlord or to the
Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This means that the
tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 1, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.
10.  
The Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount of $3,092.37
together with any accrued interest. **
