of:


 
809, 30 BASE LINE ROAD W
  LONDON ON N6J1V3


 




Between:

Middlesex Community Housing


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


John Huffman


Tenant



 
 
 
On January 12, 2022,
London & Middlesex
Community Housing (the 'Landlord') applied in this L4
application for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict John Huffman (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent
the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
hearing order issued by the Board on
September 16, 2021 with respect to L2 application SWL-50001-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The hearing order provided in
paragraph 7 that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the
Tenant to terminate the
tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: On or about January
2, 2022, the Tenant interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the unit by calling and verbally abusing
the on-call operators, as well as the on call Manager. This was a breach of
paragraphs 1 to 4 of the hearing order. This L4 application was filed within 30
days of the breaches.
 
3.       
Since the Tenant breached
the hearing order, paragraph 9 allowed the previously-waived
filing fee of $186.00 from the L2 application to be due and owing.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this
order).

2.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00*. This amount represents the and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous L2 application.
 
3.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$15.95 per day for compensation for the use of the
unit starting January
26, 2022 to the date the
Tenant actually moves out of the unit
or gets evicted.
 
4.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
5.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
6.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.
 
 
January 25, 2022

has until February

stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.
