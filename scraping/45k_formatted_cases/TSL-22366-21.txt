AMENDED
Order under Section
16.1 of the
Statutory
Powers Procedure Act
and the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-22366-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


0109, 82 WARREN
ROAD TORONTO ON M4V2R7


 




Between:


Danbar Property Holdings Ii Lp


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Florian
Tota


Tenant



 
 
 
This amended order is issued to amend the original
order issued on November 17, 2021. The Landlord submitted a request to amend a
clerical error in the original order, specifically to account for the payments
made by the Tenant after the application was filed and before
the original hearing and to correct the monthly rent amount. As a result, there is a consequential
amendment to the termination date. The
amendments have been bolded and underlined for easy reference. The remainder is unchanged.
 
 
Danbar Property
Holdings Ii Lp (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Florian Tota (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on September 1, 2021.
 
Only the
Landlord’s Legal Representative Sharron Harris attended the hearing. As of 1:54 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly notified
by the Board of this hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant
has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from April 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective May 25, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The monthly
rent is $1,430.80.




File Number: TSL-22366-21
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,426.18 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from January 1, 2021 to
May 25, 2021.
 
6.    
The Tenant
paid $5,391.50 after the application was filed.
 
7.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until January 4, 2021 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act. This precludes the possibility of the order being enforced
during the holiday period.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before January 4, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to
the Landlord $3,966.31*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to December 15, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$47.04 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 16, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves
out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on
or before December 26, 2021, the
Tenant will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from December 27, 2021 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 4, 2022, then starting January
5, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 5,
2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$6,253.30 if the payment
is made on or before
December 31, 2021,
or ii)  $7,684.10 if the payment is made on or
before January 4, 2022**.
If the Tenant
does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.




File Number: TSL-22366-21
 
9.    
The Tenant
may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 5, 2022
but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant
is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
