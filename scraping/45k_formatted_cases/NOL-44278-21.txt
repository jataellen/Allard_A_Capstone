Pierre And Linda Robillard
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Bobby Lajeunesse and Jodie Branton (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 27, 2022. Only the Landlord, Lin Robillard, and the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Monique
Laderoute, attended the hearing. As of 2:43 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2021 to October
31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 24, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on October
31, 2021. The Tenants were in
possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,200.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of October
31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-44278-21

The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $2,400.00*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 16, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
