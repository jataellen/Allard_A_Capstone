Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03837-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


MAIN FLOOR, 53 STANWELL DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6Z3Y8


 




Between:


Harjot Sharma


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Colin Moras Kevin Moras Olivia Moras


Tenants



 
 
 
Harjot Sharma (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Moras, Olivia
Moras and Colin Moras (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late
in paying their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
24, 2022. The Landlord,
represented by Sarah Teal, and the Tenant Olivia Moras, represented by Kamal
Rezabeik, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it was due.
 
2.    
On September 20, 2021 the Board
issued order CEL-00233-21. The
Tenants owed the Landlord nearly 18 months rent totalling $41,016.00 to the end
of September 2021. The Board’s
monetary jurisdiction limited the amount the Board could order the Tenants to
pay to void the order to $35,000.00. The Tenants paid this amount
and voided the order.
 
3.     Since that order was voided,
the Tenants have paid the Landlord $1,000.00
of the
$11,500.00 they owe the Landlord. The Tenants have been late and not paid rent for the five months since the order was
issued.
 
4.     The Tenants have also not paid the utility costs for gas, hydro and water for an additional total of $1,620.00.
 
5.     The Tenants claim the Landlord
has not performed maintenance on the rental home. The
Landlord’s representative submits that the City was involved and closed the
file.




 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021
 
7.     As with order CEL-00233-21, I also find this tenancy
is no longer viable.
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of March 11, 2022. The Tenants must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 11, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,461.58, which represents compensation for the use of the
unit from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$75.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from March 1, 2022 to the
date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing on or before March 11, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 12,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 11, 2022, then starting
March 12, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 12, 2022.

81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction

unit is located.
