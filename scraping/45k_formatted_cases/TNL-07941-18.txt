Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07941-18



 


 


 



 
FP (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict SAL and DW (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not
pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard in Toronto on September 20,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s property manager, PM
and the Tenant, (DW) attended the hearing on behalf of the Tenants. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants have not paid
the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June 1,
2018 to September 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a
Notice of Termination effective June 22, 2018.
2.     
The monthly rent as of the date
of the hearing is $1,585.95.
3.     
There was no dispute that
the Tenants owe the total of $6,434.68, which represents the arrears of rent to
September 30, 2018 ($6,259.68), and the application filing fee ($175.00).
4.     
The Landlord collected a
rent deposit of $1,557.91 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held
by the Landlord.
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018 to June 22, 2018.
6.     
The Tenants have lived in
the unit since August 2010.
7.     
It was the evidence of the
Tenant, DW that he has been on sick leave from his employment since October
2017 to May 2018. The Tenants have not paid the rent since June 2018 as DW has
been waiting on insurance funds from a car accident. DW explained that he has
not received any funds from the insurance company because he was being
re-assessed in June 2018.  DW also states that the week before the hearing he
has returned to his employment at courier company. DW says that his monthly
income is approximately $3,000.00 and he can also do a lot over overtime to
earn extra income. DW also says that Tenant, SL has not been employed for about
two years and does not have a source of income.
8.     
DW testified that the week
before the hearing he went to the rent bank and was told that the rent bank
would provide him with funds to pay the arrears if the Tenants pay two month’s
rent. 
9.     
The Tenants requested relief
and proposed to pay the rent on the 5th of each month, commencing
October 2018; and $300.00 on the 20th of each month, commencing
October 20, until the arrears are paid in full. When told that this plan is
very lengthy and would take about twenty one months for the arrears to be paid,
DW changed the monthly amount from $300.00 to $700.00. At this point, I
questioned DW as to whether he was just saying an amount because he believed he
had to reduce the length of the plan. I questioned DW as to why the Tenants
could not pay the rent when due going forward on the 1st day of each
month. DW says that he preferred to pay on the 5th just in case he
did not have the full amount on the 1st.  
10.  
The Landlord opposed the
Tenants’ payment plan and submitted that it would take the Tenants about five
months to pay two month’s rent before they can go back to the rent bank. The
Landlord also submitted that the parties have been to the Board several times
due to arrears of rent. The Landlord was willing to delay the eviction to October
15, 2018.
11.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to
postpone the eviction until October 15, 2018 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of
the Act.  
12.  
I considered that the Tenants
are in considerable arrears or rent and have not paid rent in over four months;
and did not provide any documentary evidence that the insurance company stopped
their payments in June. I considered the Tenants’ payment plan and it would
take the Tenants over 9 months to pay the arrears. I am not of the view that
the Landlord should have to wait for 5 months (if the Tenants get funds from
the rent bank) to 9 months for the arrears to be paid in full. I also
considered that the Tenants cannot pay the rent when due on the 1st
of the month.  
13.  
I considered the length of
the tenancy and will give the Tenants additional time to find a new place to
live. This additional time, may allow DW to work overtime so he can obtain the
funds from the rent bank and void this order and continue the tenancy.
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
Unless the Tenants void the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is
terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before October
15, 2018.
2.     
The Tenants shall pay to the
Landlord $4,392.38*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to September 24, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $52.14 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting September 25, 2018 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenants shall also pay
to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenants do not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before October 5, 2018, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from
October 6, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before October 15, 2018, then starting October 16, 2018, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after October 16, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenants wish to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $6,434.68 if the payment is made on or before September 30, 2018, or
ii)       $8,020.63 if the payment is made on or before October 15, 2018**.
If the Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after October 16,
2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
