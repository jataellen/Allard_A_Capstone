Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43290-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


154
  SECORD ROAD SUDBURY ON P3E4N1


 




Between:


Brian Maki


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Buchi Tabele Sarah Tabele


Tenants



 
 
 
Brian Maki (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Buchi Tabele and Sarah
Tabele (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or
someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully
or negligently caused
undue damage to the
premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to
compensate the Landlord for the damage.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
926 1955 6523# on November
22, 2021. Only the
Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants called
the Landlord and informed him that the deck had fallen off the side of
the house.
 
2.    
It is the Landlord’s position that the Tenants are responsible because
they tie their dogs
up to the railing. The Landlord
also testified that their children were playing with a hose on the deck and the water also
contributed to the weakening of the structure.
The Landlord is seeking $10,000.00 to repair the deck.
 
3.     The photographs show that the deck detached from the
side of the house. Considering the fact an outdoor
deck is exposed to rain,
snow and environmental elements every day, I find it unlikely that children
playing with water on the deck would have been a contributing factor in the
deck coming off the house.
 
4.     I also find that a properly constructed deck should withstand
the force caused by dog tied
to the railing.
 
5.     I find, on a balance
of probabilities, that the Tenants
did not cause
the deck to fall off the
side of the house.
