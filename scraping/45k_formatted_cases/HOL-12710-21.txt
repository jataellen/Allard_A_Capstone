Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12710-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


5408, 2221 YONGE
STREET TORONTO ON M4S0B8


 




Between:


Myungsuk Jin Tae
Hoon Kim


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Christopher C. Delgado


Tenant



 
 
 
Myungsuk Jin and Tae Hoon Kim
(the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christopher C. Delgado (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
15, 2022. Only the
Landlords attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants dogs continually bark. They defecate and urinate on the balcony
and the excrements are seeping
on the balcony below. The residents in the condominium below the Tenant’s have complained to the condominium and the
Landlords are facing significant fines due to this issue from the condominium
board.
 
2.    
The Landlord have served
two N5 notices on the Tenant and this issue continues.
 
3.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 1, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the
rental unit on or before March 1, 2022.
 
2.    If the unit is not vacated on or before March 1, 2022,
then starting March 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.




File Number: HOL-12710-21
 
 
 
3.    Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord on or after March 2, 2022.
 
4.    The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of the application.
 
5.    The Landlords have the right to collect
the full amount at any time.
 
6.    If the Tenant does not pay the full amount
owing by February
28, 2022 the Tenant will owe
interest. This will be simple interest calculated at 2% annually
on the outstanding balance.
