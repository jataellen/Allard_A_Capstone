In the matter of:      5, 2341 PARKHAVEN
BOULEVARD

Between:                  Luigi Lo Faso                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




Daniel Baiguildine Katherine Plewa


Tenants




 
 
 
Luigi Lo Faso (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Katherine Plewa and Daniel Baiguildine (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord's Legal Representative, Sam Ursino, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from September 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective September 18, 2020.
 
2.    
The Tenants vacated the rental unit on
March 31, 2022. The Tenants
were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent was $2,600.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding a
last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
6.     The tenancy began in
February 2020. At the beginning of the tenancy, the Tenants
paid six months of rent in advance. The Tenants take the position that
prior to the commencement of the tenancy, the Landlord assured
them that the internet was “great”.
However, upon moving into the rental unit, the Tenants discovered that the
internet service was not as promised. Accordingly, the Tenants testified that
they had to pay




File Number: SOL-17019-20
 
$3,000.00 out of pocket
to obtain internet
that was suitable
to their needs.
Therefore, the Tenants take
the position that they should be entitled to 50 percent of the rent back for
the six-month period that they had paid in advance.
 
7.     I disagree with the Tenants. I say this because the
internet service was provided by a third party and not the Landlord. It was uncontested that internet service
was not included in the lease agreement between
the parties. Further, it was uncontested the Tenants never complained to the Landlord about the internet
service. Finally, the Tenants failed to do their due diligence to
determine whether the internet service was sufficient for their needs prior to
the commencement of the tenancy. For these reasons, I find that the Landlord is
not liable to the Tenants for the insufficient internet.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy is terminated as of March 31, 2021,
the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$18,121.75*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to March 31, 2021.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.    
If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
