Savindg Israilov


Tenant



 
 
 
The Avenel Non Profit Housing
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Savindg Israilov (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has
also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for
the damage; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has wilfully caused undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an
order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and
because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone
the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; because the Tenant or
another occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has carried
out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or occupation
in the rental unit or the residential complex.
The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on January
20, 2022. The Landlord’s
representatives, Geoff Paine and Sandra Smith attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant was still in possession of the rental
unit as of the date the application was filed.
 
2.     The Tenant vacated
the rental unit on October
17, 2021.
 
3.     Based on the photographs and submissions made at the
hearing, I find the Tenant has caused wilful damage to the rental unit. The damage includes torn apart kitchen
cabinets, torn up flooring, broken
closet and bedroom
doors, broken windows,
and holes in the walls.
