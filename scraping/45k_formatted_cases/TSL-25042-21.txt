Susan Yox
  Tom Yox


Tenants



 
 
 
Peter Colagiacomo (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Susan Yox and Tom Yox (the 'Tenants')
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 14, 2021.
The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord served a voidable N5 notice of
termination on September 18, 2021. The
voiding period runs from September 19-25, 2021. The Tenant is deemed to have voided this notice.
 
2.     The Landlord served a second non-voidable N5 notice of
termination on October 27, 2021 where it is alleged
that the Tenant refused to provide consent
for the Landlord to lawfully
enter the rental unit when proper notice had been given.
 
3.     It was uncontested that the Landlord had scheduled an
annual fire inspection and had served a valid notice of entry on October 22,
2021 for the inspection to take place on October 26, 2021 between10:00 a.m.,
and noon. The parties exchanged
emails thereafter and could
not come to a meeting
of the minds regarding entry,
and as such the Tenant
denied entry.
 
4.     The Landlord confirmed that he has since not attempted
entry to conduct the fire inspection. He testified that fire inspections have to be paid for and that in the absence of consent from the Tenant regarding
entry he was unwilling to spend more money only to have entry denied.




 
5.    
The Tenant testified that he preferred
to be present for inspections and had proposed alternative dates to the
Landlord.
 
6.     Section 27 of the Act provides that a Landlord may
enter a rental unit in accordance with written
notice provided to the tenants
at least 24 hours before
the time of entry, in order to carry out an inspection to determine
whether or not a rental unit complies with safety standards.
 
7.     I am satisfied that the Landlord served a valid notice
of entry more than 24 hours in advance for a valid purpose
to conduct an annual fire inspection for compliance with safety.
 
8.    
The Tenant testified that they had asked to reschedule so that they could be present but that
the Landlord had refused. They stated that there had been prior
notice of entry that
they had accommodated by adjusting their own schedules. Finally, they have a teenage daughter in the rental
unit and were concerned for her.
 
9.    
I
am satisfied that the Tenant did refuse entry of the Landlord on October 26, 2021 after having received a lawful notice.
 
10.  I have considered the Tenant submissions under s.83 of
the Act, in particular that they are long-term Tenants and were willing to
accommodate the Landlord for inspection dates.
However, I am cognizant that Landlord’s need to be free to schedule annual
fire inspections for all Tenants and that it would be unreasonable to
expect to negotiate inspection dates annually for multiple tenants. This would be a hardship that is
unreasonable given the costs that might be involved.
 
11.  As noted above, the Landlord did not attempt to
reschedule the fire inspection, and this non-voidable N5 only sets out one
proven allegation that the Tenant refused consent to enter to conduct the fire inspection. I note also that the voidable N5 was also for a denial
on entry on lawful notice from the Landlord.
 
12.  Therefore, in all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to grant relief from eviction and order the Tenant to permit
entry as required under the Act.
 
13.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s)
set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.   
The Tenant shall not refuse or deny lawful
entry of the Landlord when provided notice according to the Act for a period
of 12 months from the date of this order.
 
2.    If the Tenants breaches the condition set out in paragraph 1, then the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants, under paragraph 1 of this order. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of
a breach of a condition set out in paragraphs 1 of this order.
