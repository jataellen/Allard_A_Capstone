Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CET-99265-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


1508, 501 ST.CLAIR AVENUE TORONTO ON M5P0A2


 




Between:


Samuel Delage


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Elliot Falovitch


Landlord



 
 
Samuel Delage (the 'Tenant')
applied for an order determining that Elliot Falovitch (the ‘Landlord’) collected or retained money illegally.
 
The hearing was held by videoconference on February 3, 2022. The Tenant
and the Landlord were both present at the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     On February 22, 2021 the Tenant applied to the Board,
pursuant to s. 135(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act'), with a T1 application (T1) alleging that on September 11, 2020 the
Tenant vacated the rental unit and the Landlord did not use the rent deposit
to pay the last month’s
rent, did not return the rent deposit
to the Tenant, did not pay
the Tenant interest on the rent deposit, and sold the Tenant’s property without
paying the Tenant the proceeds from the sale.
 
2.    
The Tenant filed this application within one-year of the date that the money was allegedly
retained illegally pursuant to s. 135(4) of the Act. Therefore, the Tenant’s three allegations will be considered.
 
3.     The Tenant moved into the rental unit on June 1, 2018,
and vacated the rental unit on September 11, 2020. The monthly
rent at the termination of the tenancy
was $2080.79.
 
Rent Deposit and Interest
 
4.     The Tenant testified that he paid a rent deposit to
the Landlord of $2000.00 on May 22, 2018. The
Tenant testified further that he
paid rent up to and including August
2020, the last full month of the tenancy; however, he did not pay rent for the period of
September 1 to 11, 2020, and acknowledged that he owed the Landlord
$762.96 in rent for this period.
 
5.     The Tenant stated that on September 11, 2020 the Landlord did not return to him his rent deposit of $2000.00 less the $762.96
he owed for the period of September 1 to 11, 2020




 
– a total of $1237.04. The Tenant stated
further that the Landlord also did not pay him
$80.79 in interest on the rent deposit.
 
6.     The Landlord testified that the Tenant had signed a
one year fixed term lease for the period of June 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021; however, on July 13, 2020 the Tenant
provided him with a notice to terminate the tenancy on September 11, 2020 on
the basis that the tenant could find lower rent elsewhere. The Landlord stated that he accepted the
Tenant’s termination of the tenancy
on September 11, 2020, but he decided
to retain the Tenant’s $2000.00 rent deposit and
interest on the rent deposit because the Tenant terminated the 1-year lease
before the completion of the fixed term of the lease.
 
7.     The Landlord acknowledged receiving the Tenant’s
$2000.00 rent deposit
on May 22, 2018.
 
Analysis – Termination of Tenancy
 
8.    
Section 47 of the Act
states:
 
A tenant may terminate
a tenancy at the end of a period of the tenancy
or at the end of the term of a tenancy for a fixed term
by giving notice of termination to the landlord in accordance with section 44.
 
9.     Section 44(3) of the Act states:
 
A notice under section 47, 58 or
144 to terminate a yearly tenancy shall be given at least 60 days before
the date the termination is specified to be effective and that date shall be on the last day of a yearly
period on which the tenancy is based.
 
10.  Section 37(3) of the Act, Termination by agreement, states:
 
A notice of termination need not be given if a landlord
and a tenant have agreed to
terminate a tenancy.
 
11.  Although the Tenant on July 13, 2020 provided 60 days
notice to terminate the tenancy on September 11, 2020, this date of termination was not May 31, 2021, the last day of the
yearly fixed term lease. I find that
the Tenant’s notice of termination on July 13, 2020 was not pursuant to s. 47 and 44(3) of the Act, and therefore
not a valid notice.
 
12.  However, the Landlord agreed to the Tenant’s July 13,
2020 request to terminate the tenancy on September 11, 2020; therefore, pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, I find that the tenancy was lawfully terminated on
September 11, 2020 in accordance with the Act.
 
Analysis – Rent Deposit and Interest
 
13.  Section 106(10) of the Act states:
 
A landlord
shall apply a rent deposit
that a tenant has paid to the landlord
or to a former landlord in
payment of the rent for the last rent period before the tenancy terminates.




 
14.  Section 135(1) of the
Act states:
 
A tenant or former
tenant of a rental unit may apply to
the Board for an order
that the landlord,
superintendent or agent of the landlord pay to the tenant any money the person collected
or retained in contravention of this Act or the Tenant Protection Act, 1997.
 
15.  Given a monthly
rent of $2080.79, the rent for the period of September 1 to 11, 2020,
using a daily rate of $68.41, was $752.51.
 
16.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I find that the
Landlord collected a $2000.00 rent deposit from the Tenant on May 22, 2018, and applied $752.51
of this rent deposit for the
rent payment over the period of September 1 to 11, 2020. However,
the Landlord did not
return the remaining $1247.49 of the rent deposit to the Tenant. I therefore find that the Landlord owes
the Tenant $1247.49, the Tenant’s remaining rent deposit, pursuant to s.
106(10) and s. 135(1) of the Act.
 
17.  Section 106(6) of the Act
states:
 
A landlord of a rental unit shall pay interest to the tenant annually on the amount of the rent deposit at a rate equal to the
guideline determined under section 120 that is in effect at the time payment
becomes due.
 
18.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I find that the
Landlord held a $2000.00 rent deposit from the Tenant from May 22, 2018 to August 31, 2020, and held the remaining
$1247.49 of the rent deposit from
September 1 to 11, 2020. I further
find that the Landlord, upon the termination of the Tenant’s tenancy on
September 11, 2020, did not pay the Tenant interest on the rent deposit over the period of
May 22, 2018 to September 11, 2020.
 
19.  The guideline interest
rate in 2018 and 2019 pursuant to s. 120 of the Act was 1.8%, and for 2020 it was 2.2%. The $2000.00 rent deposit from May 22,
2018 to December 31, 2019 generated interest of $57.88 using an interest rate
of 1.8%. The $2000.00 rent deposit
from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 generated further interest of $29.29
using an interest rate of 2.2%. Finally,
the $1247.49 rent deposit from September 1 to 11, 2020 provided interest of $0.83 using an interest rate of 2.2%. The total interest generated from May 22,
2018 to September 11, 2020 was $88.00. Therefore,
I find that the Landlord owes the Tenant a total of $88.00 in rent deposit
interest pursuant to s. 106(6) and s. 135(1) of the Act.
 
Proceeds of the Sale of the Tenant’s Property Tenant’s Evidence
20.  The Tenant testified
that the tenancy
agreement lease signed by the Landlord on May 19, 2018 states that the rent includes
window blinds that will be installed by the Landlord before the start of the
lease on June 1, 2018. The Tenant
submitted the lease to the Board.




 
21.  On May 20, 2018, the Landlord’s real estate
representative, Bobby Pasternak, advised the
Tenant’s real estate representative that blinds would not be installed in the unit and if this
is an issue for the Tenant,
the Landlord is content
to terminate the rental agreement. The Tenant’s real estate
representative responded that the Tenant would install his own blinds. The Tenant submitted the May 20, 2018
email exchange between both real estate representatives to the Board.
 
22.  On June 1, 2018 the Tenant stated that he purchased bedroom
and living room blinds for the unit at a cost of $767.79
including tax. The Tenant submitted
the receipt of this purchase.
 
23.  The Tenant testified further that as the end of his
tenancy approached, he advised the Landlord that he was willing to
leave the unit blinds behind for the next tenant of the unit. The Tenant remarked that this offer was provided
to the Landlord on the assumption that the Landlord would re-rent the unit –
not sell the unit to a new owner. The
Tenant acknowledged that he never told the Landlord that he could only
retain the blinds if the unit was re-rented.
 
24.  The Tenant stated that when he became aware that the
Landlord sold the unit, he requested compensation of $700.00 plus tax for the blinds
he had installed. The Tenant submitted an August 31, 2020 email
exchange with the Landlord on this subject.
 
25.  The Tenant noted
that on September 19, 2020, rather than reimbursing him for the blinds,
the Landlord offered the assistance of his mother, a home blinds
specialist, to provide the Tenant with blinds in his new rental
unit at the best possible price. The
Tenant stated that he was receptive
to this assistance, but the Landlord’s mother never contacted him, and he never
received $767.79 from the Landlord for the cost of the blinds that he installed
in the rental unit.
 
Landlord’s Evidence
 
26.  The Landlord’s real estate representative, Bobby
Pasternak, testified that he advised the Tenant’s real estate
representative that blinds would not be provided
in the unit; however, he did not recall whether
he advised the Landlord of his assertion that blinds would not be installed.
 
27.  The Landlord testified that his real estate agent
advised him that he was not responsible to provide blinds for the rental
unit, and the Tenant, on his own initiative, installed
blinds. As the end of the tenancy approached, the Landlord stated that
the Tenant appeared ambivalent about the blinds, telling him to just keep the
blinds for the next tenant.
 
28.  The Landlord stated that the Tenant was free to remove
the blinds when he vacated the
rental unit on September 11, 2020, but he chose
not to. The Landlord
remarked that the blinds were custom fitted for the rental unit, and therefore
it was unlikely that the Tenant
could have used them in his new rental unit.
 
29.  The Landlord stated further that as a result of personal financial hardships due to COVID,
as well as some difficulty in finding a new tenant for the unit, he decided to
sell the unit




 
rather than re-rent it. He noted
that this decision
was not malicious in nature to gain
financial benefit from the blinds that the Tenant had installed.
 
Analysis – Sale of Blinds
 
30.  I accept that the tenancy agreement signed on May 19,
2018 required the Landlord to install blinds. However,
the assertion by the Landlord’s real estate representative on May 20, 2018 that
blinds would not be installed, was accepted by the Tenant, and the
Tenant willingly purchased blinds without further coordination or disagreement with the Landlord.
 
31.  I also accept that the Tenant, before vacating the
rental unit, offered the blinds to the Landlord at no cost; however, the
Landlord was not aware that this offer was conditional on re-renting the unit,
not selling the unit. I further
accept that, without receiving reimbursement
from the Landlord
for the blinds, the Tenant was free to remove
the blinds from the rental
unit before vacating the unit on September 11, 2020; however, he chose not to.
 
32.  On the basis of the evidence provided, I am satisfied
that the Tenant voluntarily purchased unit blinds, and advised the Landlord to
retain the blinds for the next tenant. I
am also satisfied that the Tenant elected not to remove the blinds when he
became aware that the unit was sold
and his subsequent request for reimbursement from the Landlord was not
forthcoming. For these reasons, I
find that the Tenant effectively abandoned claim to the blinds after the
termination of the tenancy on September 11, 2020. The Landlord did not sell the Tenant’s
property, and therefore
the Landlord has not
retained the proceeds of any sale of the Tenant’s property pursuant to s.
135(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.     The Landlord
shall pay to the Tenant the sum of $1335.49.
This amount represents the rent deposit of $1247.49 retained by the Landlord, and
$88.00 for interest on the last month's rent deposit.
 
2.     The Landlord
shall also pay to the Tenant $53.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     The total amount
the Landlord owes the Tenant is $1388.49.
 
4.    
If the Landlord does not pay the
Tenant the full amount owing by March 15, 2022, the Landlord will owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
