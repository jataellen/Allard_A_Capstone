Order under Sections 30 and 31
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOT-35710-19
 
 
(‘CB’) and JB (the 'Tenants')
applied for an order determining that RVPI, HD and JD (the 'Landlords') failed
to meet the Landlords' maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'),
that the Landlords
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or
residential complex by them and that the Landlords withheld or deliberately
interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service that the Landlords are
obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement.
 
This application was heard on
June 2, 2021 in Passcode 250 828 208 VC76 and on July 22, 2021in Passcode
215 965 491 VC 75. Only the Tenant CB and the Tenants’ representative,  (‘AB-S’), attended the hearing on June 2, 2021 and only the
Tenants’ representative, AB-S, attended the hearing on July 22, 2021.
 
This application is one of 16 related
tenant applications against the Landlords concerning the effective shut down of a mobile
home park (the ‘Park’)
and certain maintenance and repair issues leading up to the time of the
effective shut down.
 
Refer to order NOT-33990-18-HR (the ‘Base Order’)
issued February 1, 2022, concurrently with this and the other 14 related individual Tenant
applications. That order sets out my determinations on the liability of the
Landlords pertaining to events leading up to the Park’s closure and the
availability of remedies related to the closure itself.
 
The application under file number NOT-33990-18 was a multi-tenant T2 application brought on behalf of fifteen tenants
identified in Schedule
1 to that order (‘Park
Tenants’), seeking relief for
the discontinuance of power to the Park. A
separate T6 application and/or T2 application was brought by each of the
fifteen Park Tenants, seeking relief for the Landlords’ actions and inactions
pertaining to the Park’s water supply, the Park’s sewage system and the effective
closure of the Park. This application under file NOT-35710-19 is one of those
applications.




 
The hearing of issues common to
all of the applications, meaning common to the application under file number NOT-33990-18 and the fifteen
individual applications, proceeded to completion on
July 22, 2022 in Passcode 215 965 491 VC 75 following a number of earlier
appearances.
The hearing of the Tenant’s individual issues under file number NOT-35710-19 proceeded on June 2,
2019. The procedural history is set out in the Base Order.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
As set out in the Base Order, I find that that:
 
a)    
The Landlords withheld or interfered with the provision
of electricity, a vital service;
 
b)     The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s sewage
system, allowing problems with sewage discharges and
significant odours over a period that extends back prior to one year prior to
the Tenant’s application filing in March 2019;
 
c)      The Landlords failed
to repair or maintain the Park’s
water system such that the supply
of potable water was compromised for roughly two weeks at the beginning of
March 2018 and throughout the period June through October 2018;
 
d)     The Landlords’ failures
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the units and the Park by the Tenants,
both prior to and after October 2018; and
 
e)     The above failures, combined with the Landlords’
decision to cease providing all services at the Park as of October, 2018,
attract various remedies, some pertaining to events leading up to the October
2018 effective closure
and others pertaining to events
following that effective closure.
 
2.   
The Tenants claim for two classes
of remedies: first,
those attributable to the wrongdoing of the Landlords prior to the
Park’s effective closure on in October 2018; and second; those attributable to
the Park’s closure.
 
3.   
I find the following facts, as they pertain to the Tenants’ requests for remedies for the impacts of events leading
up to October 2018, on the basis of the uncontroverted testimony of the Tenant
CB and, where
indicated, on certain
documents filed with the
Board as Tab F of the Tenants’ productions;
 
a)     The Tenants paid rent of $289.00 per month at the Park;
 
b)     The Tenants were forced to purchase water for drinking
and cooking throughout the period in which I have found that the drinking water supply
was compromised;
 
c)     
The Tenants enjoyment of their
unit and the Park was impacted by the presence of raw sewage, from time to time, under their unit and on the road in the Park. They were impacted on an ongoing basis by odour
from the sewage, which they mitigated by leaving the door to the trailer
closed;




 
d)    
The Tenants contributed $50.00 to the $1,000.00 cost of
repairing an electric transformer in the Park during
the summer of 2018;
 
e)     The Tenants vacated
the Park on October 30, 2018, further
to the Landlords’ July 31, 2018 notice of closure;
 
f)       The Tenants lost the value of their trailer which,
on the evidence, amounted to roughly
$20,000;
 
g)     The Tenants paid $274.00 for the removal
of a propane tank on their departure from the Park;
 
h)     The Tenants incurred
$271.20 for storage
over the period
October 2018 through March 2019 (Refer Tab F-3 for
receipts for storage); and
 
i)       
The Tenants did not want to leave the Park. They had viewed their home at the Park
as their “forever home” and felt that their departure
from the Park resulted in a loss of
freedom that they had enjoyed at the Park.
 
First Type of Remedies - for the Period
Prior to October 30 2018
 
4.   
For the first type of remedies, I
have considered compensation for events occurring between March 12 2018, being one year prior to the date on this application was filed, and October 30, 2018, when the Park was
effectively closed.
 
5.   
I
find that the Tenants are entitled to a
rebate of $72.25, being 5% of the $289.00 monthly rent which they paid at the Park
from the 5 month period June through October 2018, for the lack of potable
water during that period.
 
6.    I find that the Tenants
are entitled to a rebate
of $216.75, being 10% of the of the $289.00
monthly rent which they paid at the Park for the period 7 ½ month period from
mid-March 2018 (being one year before the filing of the Tenants’ application
with the Board) through October 2018 for the impacts of the Landlords’ failure
to maintain or repair the sewage system.
 
7.   
I
find that the Tenants are entitled to compensation in the amount of $50.00 for their contribution to the cost of the
transformer repair in the summer of 2018.
 
Second Type of Remedies - Pursuant to the Park Closure
 
8.   
For the second type of remedies,
as set out in the Base Order, I find
the following:
 
a)    
The Tenants are not entitled to compensation for the lost value of the mobile
home;
 
b)     The Tenants are entitled to some compensation for the
increased costs of rent, over and above the rental rate at the Park
when they vacated the Park,
up to and including July
2019 (being twelve months from the July 31, 2018 notice of Park closure);




 
 
 
c)     
The Tenants are entitled
to compensation for moving and storage costs; and
 
d)    
The Tenants may be entitled to damages for interference with reasonable enjoyment.
 
 
9.    I find that the Tenants are entitled to payment of the
$452.00 increase in rent over the rent paid at the Park for a period of 9
months - from the time they vacated the Park to the end of what would have been a 12 month notice period.
The Tenants are entitled to a payment of $4,068.00.
 
10. I find that the Tenants
are entitled to payment of their
moving costs (storage) in the amount
of $271.20.
 
11. I find that the Tenants are not entitled to payment
for the costs of removing their propane tank,
As set out in the Base Order, I find that certain costs would have been
incurred by the Park Tenants regardless of whether the Landlords complied with
the Act’s requirements for proper closure of the Park. The lost value of the mobile home is one such cost and is a cost for which the Tenants
are not entitled to recovery.
The cost of the
propane tank removal is, similarly, a cost for which the Tenants are not
entitled to recovery.
 
12. I considered whether to award the Tenants damages for
interference with reasonable enjoyment. I recognize that it is likely that the months leading up to the expedited
closure of the Park at the end of October 2018 would have had a negative impact on
the Tenants. However, the Tenants
mitigated the impacts by moving to new accommodation immediately following the
effective closure of the Park. They
have been awarded compensation for their increased rent. Accordingly, I find that an award an additional damages award is
not warranted in the circumstances.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlords shall pay to the Tenants
a total of $4,678.20, representing payment for the following:
 
a)     rent abatement of $289.00 for the impacts
of the compromised water supply
and problems with the sewage system;
 
b)     $50.00 compensation for the costs
of the transformer repair;
 
c)     
$4,068.00 for the increase
in rent over 9 months
following the Tenants’ departure
from the Park; and
 
d)     $271.20 for storage
costs.
 
2.    
The Landlords shall pay the Tenants
the full amount owing by March 31, 2022.




 
3.    
If the Landlords do not pay the
Tenants the full amount owing by March 31, 2022 the Landlords will owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the outstanding
balance.
