WILLIAMSPORT DRIVE
  MISSISSAUGA ON L4X1T6


 




Between:


Imh Pool XIV LP


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mohamed Awisse Mohamed Hassain


Tenants



 
 
 
IMH Pool XIV LP
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Mohamed Hassain and Mohamed Awisse
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the
rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 6, 2021. Only the Only the Landlord's Agent, Sara Mathew attended the
hearing. As of 3:00 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenants
have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination
effective July 27, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenants
are in possession of the
rental unit.
 
3.     
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,670.00.
 
4.      The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,670.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.      Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from March 3,
2021 to July 27, 2021.
 
6.     
The Tenants
paid $4,710.00 after
the application was filed.
 
7.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19




 
on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant,
and find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$2,423.78*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 4, 2022, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $51.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 5, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing*
on or before January 15, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 16, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 15, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $4,896.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January 16, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives
vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
