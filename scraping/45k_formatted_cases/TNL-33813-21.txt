Natalia Lopes (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Joshua Cline and Sue
Basler (the 'Tenants') because the Landlord has entered into an agreement of
purchase and sale of the rental unit and the purchaser requires
possession of the rental unit for
the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 3:50 p.m., the Tenants
were not present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under section 49(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
who has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (APS) of the residential
complex may, on behalf of the purchaser, give the Tenant of a unit in the
residential complex a notice terminating the tenancy, if the purchaser in good faith requires possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation
 
3.    
On July 30, 2021 the Landlord gave
the Tenants a (N12) form notice to end the tenancy because the purchaser required
possession of the rental unit. The termination date in the (N12) notice was September 30, 2021.
 
4.    
The Tenant did not vacate the rental unit on
September 30, 2021 in accordance with the termination
date set out in the notice given.
 
5.    
The Landlord has filed an
affidavit by the a Huu Huynh the purchaser of the property affirming the purchase and that he in good faith requires
the rental unit for his or her own
personal use
 
6.     As of the date of the hearing, the Tenants have vacated the rental unit.




File Number: TNL-33813-21
 
 
 
7.    
The remedy sought by the Landlord
in this application was to termination of the tenancy, therefore the Landlord’s
application to end the tenancy and evict the Tenants is moot.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
