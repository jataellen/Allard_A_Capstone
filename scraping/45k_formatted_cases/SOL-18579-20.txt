Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-18579-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


1202, 200 JACKSON STREET
W HAMILTON ON L8P4R9


 




Between:


Cityhousing Hamilton Corporation


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Amira Alazawi


Tenant



 
Cityhousing Hamilton
Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Amira Alazawi (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard in Passcode: 698 7565 6669#
on June 22, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, K Howlett for K. MacIntyre, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2020. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 31, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenant paid $1,390.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.     The Landlord’s representative indicated that the
Tenant had indicated, through discussions with the Landlord’s staff,
that she understood that rent payments
had all been made on her behalf by a government agency. That government agency had in fact been
paying the Tenant’s rent for a period but the Landlord stopped receiving such
payments after September 2021.
 
4.     The Landlord’s representative was not in a position
to disclose any special circumstances affecting the Tenant for my
consideration under subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') but indicated that the Landlord planned to work with the Tenant and the
government agency to sort out the payment history and arrange to bring the rent
current.
 
5.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 28, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act to allow time for communications
between the Tenant, the government agency and the Landlord pertaining to the
rent.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 28, 2022.
 
2.      The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$838.57*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to February 1, 2022.
 
3.      The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $4.57 per day for compensation for the use of the unit
starting February 2, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 28, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from March 1, 2022 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 1, 2022.
 
8.     If, on or before February 28, 2022, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,159.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void. This means
that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if the Tenant pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 1, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
