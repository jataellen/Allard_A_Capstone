Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-23868-21
 



In the matter
of:


226, 244 CHURCH STREET TORONTO ON M5B1Z3


 




Between:


Nishnawbe Homes Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


William
Reynolds


Tenant



 
 
Nishnawbe Homes Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict William Reynolds (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application
was heard by videoconference on December 15, 2021. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Crystal
De Couto, attended the hearing.
As of 2:39 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period
from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 12, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $564.00.
 
4.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
 
5.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether
the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
January 16, 2022.




File Number: TSL-23868-21
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,669.35*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 5, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$18.54 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall
also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing*
on or before January 16, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 16, 2022,
then starting January 17, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenant pays the amount of $12,310.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after January
17, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The
Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the
tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
