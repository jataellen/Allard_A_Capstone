Magda
Kasprzyk Piotr Kasprzyk


Tenants



 
 
Blue Roof Properties Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring
Piotr Kasprzyk and Magda
Kasprzyk (the 'Tenants') to pay compensation for the money they should have
paid had they not misrepresented their income or the income of a member of
their family
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 7, 2021.
At 1:30 pm Mike Zachaczewski (MZ), the Landlord
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.   
The rental
unit is a 1-bedroom apartment in a multi-unit complex.
 
2.   
The tenancy
began in or around
2013.
 
3.   
MZ
testified that the Tenants have not paid the rent since
June 2021 and that they had
never missed a payment during the tenancy.
 
4.   
MZ testified that when
the Tenants also missed the July 2021, he tried calling on two occasions,
emailed on several occasions and went to the rental unit personally on two
occasions, one during
the daytime and one in the evening.
The Tenants did not respond.
 
5.   
It was the uncontested testimony of the Landlord that he received
a Hydro Bill during the first week of August 2021 for the
rental unit. MZ claims to have called
Hydro and was advised that the Tenants cancelled
service on or about
June 23, 2021. Hydro confirmed no usage for the rental unit
between June 23, 2021 to August 4, 2021.
 
6.   
MZ said he attempted to call the phone number again for the Tenants and received a “no
longer in service” message.




 
7.   
It was the uncontested testimony of the Landlord that he spoke with neighbouring Tenants in July 2021 and was told that the Tenants had moved to
Poland.
 
8.   
On August 10, 2021, MZ posted
a notice of entry on the Tenants door.
 
9.   
MZ inspected the rental unit on August 11, 2021 and noted no personal
belongings, no clothing, no
shoes, a few dishes, no food in fridge.
 
10.
The Landlord
testified that the Tenants were of senior
age and did not work so could not
follow up with an employer as to their status.
 
11.
The Landlord
also testified that he was not aware of any children nor family he could
contact.
 
12.
It was the testimony of MZ that in May 2021, the Tenants
contacted him to ask if he would
“pay them to leave.” MZ refused the
offer and told them they were good Tenants.
 
13.
Although MZ did
not submit any evidence to the Board,
I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of his testimony.
 
14.
According to s.2(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act (the ‘Act’):
 
For
the purposes of this Act, a
tenant has not abandoned a rental unit if the tenant is not in arrears of rent.
 
15.
MZ
testified that the last rental
payment made by the Tenants
was May 2021. No further
rent payments have been made by the Tenants.
 
16.
Based on the uncontested testimony of MZ, I am satisfied on a balance
of probabilities that the
Tenants have abandoned the unit.
 
17. The Landlord made reasonable efforts
to contact the Tenants by various methods
and various times of day. MZ
spoke with other Tenants in the residential complex who indicated the Tenant
had moved out in June 2021. MZ also
confirmed that various services had been discontinued by the Tenants.
 
18. Based on the efforts made by the Landlord to communicate
with the Tenants and the
untouched state of the Tenant’s rental unit, it is reasonable to determine that the Tenants have left the rental
complex. All of the evidence
supports the Landlord’s position that the
Tenants have left the rental unit.
 
19.
This order contains all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants abandoned
the rental unit.
