Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57581-22
 
 



In the
  matter of:


807, 1201 RICHMOND STREET N LONDON ON
  N6A3L6


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Emily-Jayne Richards


Tenant



 
 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Emily-Jayne Richards (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the
rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on August 6, 2021 with
respect to application SWL-47161-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the
Tenant if the Tenant did not
meet certain condition(s) specified
in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the following
conditions specified in the order. The Tenant did not pay $1226.88 arrears
on or before December 15, 2021. The Tenant
did not pay $1867.14 rent on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is
entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.     The Tenant was ordered to pay $7,361.26 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SWL-47161-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $2,455.50
and that amount is included
in this order.
As a result, the previous order SWL-47161-20 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed to pay the full rent that became
owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,852.84 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
7.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant
for the period
from October 1, 2021 to
January 26, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-47161-20 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenant shall
pay to the Landlord $2,178.68*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 26, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $61.39 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing* on or before
February 6, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
February 7, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 7, 2022.
 
 
January 26, 2022

The tenant has until February 5, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by February 5, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
expires on August 7, 2022 if the order
has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
