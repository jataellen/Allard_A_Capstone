Order under Section
78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-21268-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


308, 860 PHARMACY AVENUE SCARBOROUGH ON M1L3K6


 




Between:


Dd Acquisition Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Ian Mowatt


Tenant



 
 
 
Dd Acquisition Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Ian Mowatt (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on August 4, 2021 with respect to application
TEL-15995-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant
has not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $2084.00 rent on or before December
1, 2021. The Tenant did not pay $500.00 arrears on or before
December 10, 2021.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $8,812.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
TEL-15995-21. The amount
that is still owing from that
order is $7,312.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the
previous order TEL-15995-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has failed
to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
Since the date of the order,
the Landlord incurred
charges of $5.00
for cheques tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant
which were returned NSF and $20.00 for related administration charges.
 
7.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,084.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
8.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 10, 2020 to January 18, 2022.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Order TEL-15995-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 29, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$8,408.79*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 18, 2022 and the
total charges related to NSF cheques tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenant and the costs related
to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $68.52
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 19, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
29, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 30, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 29, 2022, then starting January
30, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord on or after January 30, 2022.
 
 
January 18, 2022

The tenant has until January 28, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 28, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.
 
If you have any questions about
this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.
 
In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on July 30, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction
where the rental unit is located.
