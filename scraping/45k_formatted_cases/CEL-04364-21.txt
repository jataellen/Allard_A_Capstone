Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-04364-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


308, 165 GORDON
STREET FERGUS ON N1M0A7


 




Between:


The Corporation Of The County
Of Wellington


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jeanne
(margaret) Neary


Tenant



 
 
 
The Corporation
Of The County Of Wellington (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Jeanne
(margaret) Neary (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on September 17, 2021 with respect to
application HOL-09741-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict
the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenant has not met the
following condition specified in the order: the Tenant and their guests shall
not smoke in the unit, in the residential complex or within 5 metres of the
building unless in a designated smoking area for the duration of the tenancy. On December 5, 2021 at or about 8:30 p.m. a serious
fire occurred in the rental unit. The cause of which as
determined by the Fire department was careless smoking in the bedroom of the rental unit. At this time additional evidence of smoking in the unit was found
as there were ashtrays present,
as well as cans with cigarette butts in them as well as cigarette butts located on the bed
as well. As a result of the investigation of the Fire Department indicating
smoking had been taking place in the unit the Tenant is found to be in breach
of the previous order issued by the Board.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 28, 2022.

2.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 29, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant owes to the
Landlord the sum of $186.00. This will be paid on or before January 28, 2021. If not interest
at a rate of 2% per year will start effective January
29, 2021.

the Board will schedule a hearing.
