            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-07984-18



 


 


 



 
 
FMGL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict LL
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on October 9, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, SK, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,106.63 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from May 1, 2018.
 
4.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the monthly rent.
 
5.      The
Landlord has brought similar applications regarding this tenancy in the past. 
 
6.      Order
TNL-88650-16 was issued on February 1, 2017 granting the Tenant relief from
eviction subject to the fulfillment of conditions for payment of arrears and
timely rent. That order was made based on the Tenant’s own submissions as to
the payment plan she proposed, to which the Landlord objected.
 
7.      The
Tenant failed to comply with order TNL-88650-16 resulting in the issuance of
order TNL-90788-17 on February 28, 2017, terminating the tenancy.
 
8.      The
Landlord did not enforce the eviction granted by order TNL-90788-17.
 
9.      Despite
the requirement in order TNL-88650-16 requiring the rent to be paid on or
before the first business day of each month from March 2017 until February
2018, the Tenant paid the rent late on the following occasions:
 
a)    March
2017 rent paid March 6, 2017
b)    July
2017 rent paid July 13, 2017
c)    August
2017 rent paid September 8, 2017
d)    September
2017 rent paid September 25, 2017
e)    October
2017 rent paid November 2, 2017
f)     November
2017 rent paid December 4, 2017
g)    December
2017 rent paid January 10, 2018 
h)    January
2018 rent paid January 23, 2018
i)     February
2018 rent paid March 19, 2018
 
10.   After
order TNL-88650-16 expired the Tenant continued to pay the rent late as
follows:
a)    March
2018 rent paid April 19, 2018
b)    April
2018 rent paid May 3, 2018
c)    May
2018 rent paid July 12, 2018
d)    June
2018 rent paid October 3, 2018
e)    July
2018 rent paid October 3, 2018
f)     August
2018 rent paid October 3, 2018
g)    September
2018 rent paid October 3, 2018
h)    October
2018 rent paid in part only
 
11.   The
Tenant has had several opportunities to pay rent in a timely way and has failed
to do so, despite the Tenant’s own promises, and Board orders requiring her to
do so.
 
12.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before October 31, 2018.
 
2.      As
of October 31, 2018, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord
owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the
Landlord is entitled to by $615.72*.
3.      However,
the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the
Landlord owes the Tenant:
$36.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting November 1,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
4.      The
Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as
a result of this order.
 
5.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before October 31, 2018, then starting November 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
6.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after November 1,
2018.
