of:


1/2, 138 RUBIDGE ST PETERBOROUGH ON K9J3N4


 




Between:


Robyn Taylor


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Justin Black Tracy
Clarke


Tenants



 
 
 
Robyn Taylor (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Tracy
Clarke and Justin Black (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have wilfully caused
undue damage to the premises and used the rental unit or the
residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential
premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage;
and because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted
in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a
residential complex that has three or fewer residential units. ; because they,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenants permitted in the
residential complex have seriously impaired the safety of any person
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 25, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing. As of 10:26 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    For the reasons
that follow, the Landlords application is dismissed.
 
2.   
The application is based on a N7 Notice
of Termination serve upon the Tenants on October 6, 2021; it had a termination
date of October 17, 2021.
 
3.    One of the reasons was termination for cause, reasonable enjoyment of landlord
in small building. This ground is section 65 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’) and applies to
landlords who reside in the same building as the tenant and that building
contains no more than 3 residential units. Here, the Landlord testified that
she does not live in the same building, therefore this part of the notice is
dismissed.

4.   
The notice also contains
an allegation with respect to late and persistently late rent. As neither of these issues
constitute grounds under the N7 notice, this part of the notice is
also dismissed.
 
5.    The notice claims that from “July 15th to Present” there was
“smoking in a non smoking building due to other tenants
in the building having severe allergies and cystic fibrosis” and “more than 2 tenants are living in the 1 bedroom apt.
Tenants using drugs and causing issues with other tenants in the building.
People coming and going all hours of the night”.
 
6.    In Ball v. Metro Capital Property, [2002] O.J.
No. 5931, the court held that notices of termination must contain specific
details as to the
behaviour complained of including dates and times of that behaviour.
 
7.   
The notice does not contain dates as
to when events occurred and does not set out what “issues” they were causing
for other tenants.
In order to know the case they have to meet
there must be dates and specific allegations so the Tenants know what they have
to
defend against.
Therefore, I find the notice
is fatally flawed
and the Landlord’s application must be dismissed.
 
8.   
This order contains all the reasons
for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The Landlord's application is dismissed.
