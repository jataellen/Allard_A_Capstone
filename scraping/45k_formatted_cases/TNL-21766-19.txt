Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-21766-19
 










 
 
 

BMI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict (‘SD’)
and (‘RD’, the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 6, 2020.
 
The Landlord’s representative, JS, and the Tenant RD attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the
period from April 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective October 21, 2019.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant RD agreed with the Landlord’s evidence of the Tenants’
rent arrears for the period ending February 29, 2020.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,282.68 from the Tenants and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2019
to October 21, 2019.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 31, 2020,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
6.      Although
the Tenant RD requested relief from eviction in the form of a payment plan, RD
did not propose an amount the Tenants are able to pay toward their arrears; and
did not identify when those payments may be made.
 
7.      In
the absence of relevant and reliable evidence of the Tenants’ ability to make
ordered payments to the Landlord in accordance with a payment plan, I conclude
that it is not appropriate to grant such relief from eviction.
 
8.      However,
the Landlord is holding a rent deposit from the Tenants.  I therefore conclude
that it is not unfair to postpone the eviction/voiding date to March 31, 2020.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on
or before March 31, 2020.
 
2.      The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,995.58*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 2, 2020, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $42.17 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 3, 2020 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before March
31, 2020, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2020 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before March 31, 2020, then starting April 1,
2020, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 1, 2020.
 
8.      If,
on or before March 31, 2020, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,673.76** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 1, 2020 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
