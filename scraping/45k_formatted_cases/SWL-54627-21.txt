Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-54627-21
In the matter of:      1001, 595 PROUDFOOT
LANE
LONDON ON N6H4S1
 
Between:                  Old Oak Properties Inc                                    Landlord
 
and
 
Alicia Mier                                                                                                                 Tenant
 
On September 3, 2021, Old Oak Properties Inc (the
'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Alicia Mier (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes
because the Tenant failed to meet a condition specified in the previous consent
order issued by the Board on June 24, 2021 with respect to L1 application SWL-46731-20.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$300.00 on or before September
1, 2021 towards rent arrears.
This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant was ordered
to pay $5,972.98 for rent arrears in the previous
consent Order SWL-46731-20.
The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,615.72 and that amount is
included in this order. As a result, the previous order SWL-46731-20 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the order, the Tenant has also failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from
August 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021.
 
6.       
On April 20, 2017 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,003.63 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.




 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit was
paid out up to December 31, 2020. There was no guideline rent increase allowed
(and consequently no interest on deposit) for 2021 due to
COVID19.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order SWL-46731-20 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before
January 15, 2022 (standard 11
days from the issuance date of this
order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,671.35*. This amount represents the rent owing up to September 30, 2021, less the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$33.85 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting October 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at .00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
January 4, 2022

The tenant has until January 14, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 14, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating

has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.
