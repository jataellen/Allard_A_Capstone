L.M.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order requiring J.L. (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlords in a
residential complex that has three or fewer residential units; because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and because
the Tenant or another occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act
or has carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade,
business or occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex.  This
is an L2 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant entered into an agreement to terminate the tenancy.  This
is an L3 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to pay the rent that
the Tenant owes.  This is an L9 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on February 5, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s representative, K.M.,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.     The
Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was
filed.
2.     The
Tenant did not pay the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from October 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant was still in possession of the rental unit as of the date the
application was filed.
4.     The
Landlord stated that there was a last month’s rent of $750.00 for this
tenancy.  The Landlord initially believed she could apply the last month’s rent
to October, 2017 because the Tenant was to move out by the end of October. 
This is not the case.  The last month’s rent can only be applied to the rental
period before the tenancy terminates pursuant to subsection 106(10) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’).  This means the rent for October, 2017
remains outstanding.
5.     The
tenancy is terminated as stated below under the application for serious
impairment and reasonable enjoyment.  For this reason, the amount owed to the
Landlord must take into consideration the arrears, the last month’s rent, the
interest on the last month’s rent and overholding of the tenancy.  
6.     The
arrears for the period of October 1, 2017 to the date of the order are
$1,254.79.  
7.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.  Interest on the rent deposit is owing to
the Tenant for the period from December 26, 2016 to January 21, 2018.  I
calculate the interest owing is $12.24.
8.       The
amount the Tenant owes to the Landlord is $1,254.79, less $750.00 and less
$12.24 for a total of $492.55.
THE
AGREEMENT AND NOTICE TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY
9.     The
Landlord filed an application stating that the parties had agreed the Tenant
was going to move out of the rental unit and that the Tenant had given notice
to vacate.  
10.  Based on
the evidence provided by the Landlord, I am not satisfied there was neither an
agreement to terminate nor a proper notice of termination given by the Tenant. 
In one text message received by the Tenant it clearly indicates that proper
notice had not been given and the Tenant would be remaining in the unit.
11.  For the
reasons above, the Landlord’s application for an agreement and notice to
terminate the tenancy is dismissed.
THE
APPLICATION FOR SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT AND SUBSTANTIAL INTERFERENCE
12.   The
Tenant lives in the basement unit of the Landlord’s home.  
13.   The
Landlord submitted a chronicled timeline of events which include, but are not
limited to, issues regarding excessive noise coming from the Tenant and/or his
guests; noxious odours emanating from the Tenant’s rental unit into the
Landlord’s living space; threats received from the Tenant and/or his guests;
and possible smoking of crack cocaine within the rental unit.
14.   The
Landlord served the Tenant with following Notices of Termination based on the
issues outlined in paragraph 13:
a)    Illegal
act (‘N6’); and
b)    Serious
impairment of safety and interference with the Landlord’s lawful
right, privilege or interest (’N7’).
15.   The
Landlord testified and submitted evidence that she saw the Tenant and his
girlfriend in possession of what looked to be like a crack pipe.  The Landlord
initially was not sure what the pipe was; however, after she researched the
pipe online she deemed it to be a crack pipe.  To further substantiate that
conclusion the Landlord began smelling a noxious odour from the basement.  The
Landlord described the odour to be a “horrible toxic, plastic, chemical burning
smell”.  
16.   The
Landlord repeatedly smells this odour coming up through the vents.  She went to
her doctor to be assessed because the smell has caused her to vomit.  She has
also been to the hospital for her symptoms.  The Landlord submitted a copy of
the records for the visits and a note from her doctor.
17.   The
Landlord further testified that the police have attended the rental unit on
numerous occasions for the smell and the behaviour of the Tenant.  The Landlord
provided the Board with copies of police reports she was able to obtain.  The
police told the Landlord that they also smelled the odour in her living space.
18.   The
Landlord submitted a photo of a noose tied to the tree on her front lawn. She
believes the Tenant put it there because it was a leash made into a noose and
the leash had been frozen to the ground for some time before being strung up.
19.   The
Landlord also testified that the Tenant continually disconnects the fire
alarm.  The Landlord found it disconnected and sitting in the laundry room at
one point.  When the Landlord advised the Tenant not to disconnect the alarm he
responded that he keeps burning stuff and the alarm goes off so he disconnects
it.
20.   The
Tenant has thrown the Landlord’s mail on the ground after retrieving his own
mail.  It has become so frequent and disruptive that the Landlord began rushing
home on her lunch hour to get the mail before the Tenant could discard her
mail.  To further ensure she is receiving her mail she has redirected the
mail.  The Landlord provided proof of the redirection.
21.   Given
all of the above uncontested evidence before the Board, I am satisfied the
Tenant has substantially interfered with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment
and lawful
right, privilege or interest.  In the alternative I
am also satisfied the noxious smell and continuously disconnecting the fire
alarm seriously impairs the safety of the Landlord and her husband.
22.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
23.   This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It
is ordered that:
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 14, 2018. 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $492.55, which represents the amount of rent
owing up to February 9, 2018, less the last month’s rent deposit and less the
interest on the deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $24.66 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 10, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit. 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before
February 19, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 20, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 14, 2018, then starting February
15, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 15,
2018. The Sheriff is requested to expedite the enforcement of this order.
