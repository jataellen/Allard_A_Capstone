Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TET-13996-20
 
 



In the matter
of:


A,
1787 BRONTE SQUARE PICKERING ON L1V3C1


 




Between:


Mary Pat Nash


Tenant




 


 
and


 




 


Arham Shakoor


Landlord



 
 
 
Mary Pat Nash (the 'Tenant') applied
for an order determining that Arham Shakoor (the
'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with the
Tenant.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 14, 2021.
 
The Tenant
and the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Tenant spoke
with Tenant Duty Counsel
before the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issues
 
1.     Prior to the start of the hearing,
I raised two preliminary issues
with the Tenant.
 
2.    
Having reviewed the Tenants
application, I had noted that a number
of the allegations and remedies sought
by the Tenant were outside of the one-year time limit as outlined under s. 29(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act (the “Act”).
 
3.     As such, I had asked
the Tenant to keep her testimony
within one-year of the filing date of September 14th, 2020. Taking into
consideration s. 1 of Ontario Regulation 73/20, which suspended limitation periods
from March 16th, 2020, to September 14th, 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic and
declared emergency, this would take the limitation period for the claim to
March 16th, 2019.
 
4.     I further noted that the Tenant filed a T2 application alleging
that the Landlord harassed, obstructed, coerced,
threatened, or interfered with the
Tenant in violation of s. 23 of the Act and had only noted this
allegation in her application.
 
5.    
If an allegation under s. 23 is proven by the Tenant, they may seek a remedy under s. 29
of the Act.




 
6.    
Noting the Tenants application,
some of the allegations contained issues with maintenance which would
normally be included
as part of a T6 application alleging
a violation under s. 20 of the Act, in which a remedy under s. 29 may
also be sought.
 
7.     Section 185 of the Act states:
 
(1) An application shall be filed with the Board in the form approved by the Board, shall be accompanied by the prescribed information and shall be signed by the applicant.
 
8.     Despite this section I find that T2 and T6
applications, while being different Board approved forms both contain remedies
under s. 29 of the Act and can be applied
to one another within this
application.
 
9.     As such, I was prepared
to accept evidence
on this allegation.
 
10. 
However, the Tenants application contained further allegations with respect to an illegal charge and an allegation that the
Tenant was not paid interest on last month’s rent.
 
11.  These allegations would
normally be included
in a T1 application, and remedies would
be sought under ss. 135 and 106(10) respectively.
 
12.  As such, I find that the Tenants
T2 application could
not consider these items. I note that the
Tenant spoke with Tenant
Duty Counsel ahead of the hearing and had also received
advice from the Board before filing her claim. Presumably the Tenant would have
been advised of these issues ahead of both completing her claim and conducting the hearing.
 
Maintenance
 
13. 
The Tenant
moved into the unit with her ex-husband on July 1st, 2016.
The Tenant has since moved out of the unit as of July
31st, 2020.
 
14.  When the Tenants moved in, the lease that they had signed stipulated that the Tenants would be responsible for lawn care
and snow removal. The Tenant’s ex-husband completed this work until he moved out
in 2019, and then the Tenant
would hire outside help.
 
15.  While the lease stipulates these terms, the Tenant is
correct in her assertion that snow removal is the responsibility of the Landlord
pursuant to s. 26(1)(5) of Ontario Regulation 517/06.
 
16.  That said, the Tenant is seeking $896 for snow removal, estimating 16 removals a year for 4 years. The issue is here is
that I can only consider snow removal going back to March 16th,
2019. While the Tenant never provided any receipts nor could provide me any
dates or the exact costs, this issue was uncontested by the Landlord. As such,
an abatement will be awarded as a result.




 
17.  The next issue that
the Tenant alleged was that the Landlord never secured the premises
properly which caused the Tenant to never feel safe after a break-in however,
the Tenant submitted that the
Landlord had secured the wooden door
with a locking mechanism and had mounted security cameras around
the premises. The Tenant further admitted under cross-examination that she
never advised the Landlord of this issue because she didn’t want to “stir the
pot”.
 
18.  Other than the issue
with snow removal, I find that there
is no evidence to support
the other maintenance issue the Tenant has alleged, and that the Tenant
never properly advised the Landlord
of this issue in a timely
manner as required
under s. 30(2) of the Act. As such, this portion of the
application is dismissed.
 
Harassment
 
19. 
The Tenant alleges that the Landlord contacted her ex-husband after he had moved out to harass, threaten or coerce her.
 
20.  The Tenant submitted that she had asked the Landlord to use a new e-mail address as her ex-husband had access to the old
one, and the end of the relationship had been acrimonious.
 
21. 
The Tenant submits that the Landlord
tried to get the Tenants
ex-husband involved in this
proceeding to harass her.
 
22.  The Landlord submits
that the Tenant never advised
him that her ex-husband had moved
out of the unit in March of 2019, and that she was still talking about him in
May of that year.
 
23.  The Landlord submitted e-mails from that time-period showing that the Tenant had never
mentioned to the Landlord that her ex-husband had moved out and that she did not want him to be contacted with respect to
tenancy issues.
 
24.  As such, I don’t believe
that at any point when the Tenant’s
ex-husband moved out of the unit the Landlord was ever formally
notified of same and was never told not to contact him as he was still a tenant
on the lease. This allegation is dismissed.
 
Reference Letter
 
25.  The Landlord submitted a text message thread dated
August 9th, 2020 into evidence between himself and the Tenant
detailing a request from the Tenant for a reference
letter to assist her in obtaining a new tenancy.
 
26. 
Because of some maintenance issues that came to the Landlord’s attention after the Tenant’s moved out, the Landlord
refused.
 
27.  The Tenant refuted
this allegation and then goes on to say:




 
“…If you don’t want to provide me a reference so that I can access
housing, then I will
take you to the tenant board for the difference…If you would prefer to not go the legal route and provide us with a reference we can do that”
 
28.  I find this narrative used by the Tenant
could be interpreted as an abuse
of process under
s. A8.2 of the Landlord and Tenant Board Rules of Procedure however, I will not go as far
as to make a finding in that regard
considering the tenancy has ended and
this issue has now been completed.
 
Remedies:
 
29.  With respect to the issue of snow removal, parties to
a tenancy cannot contract themselves out of the Act and as such the Landlord
was responsible for snow removal from March
16th, 2019 until
July 31st, 2020 when the Tenant
vacated the unit. That period roughly covers the winter of 2019-20.
 
30.  While the Tenant does not possess any receipts, she
estimates having paid $14 per removal at 16 removals per year.
The total then would be $224.00. This is a reasonable
out of pocket expense.
 
It is ordered that:
 
31.  The total amount
the Landlord owes is $224.00.
 
32.  The Landlord shall pay the Tenant the full amount
owing by January
30th, 2022.
 
33.  If the Landlord
does not pay the Tenant the full amount owing of $224.00 on or before January
30th, 2022, then the Landlords will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31st, 2022 annually on the balance outstanding
 
34.  The Tenant's remaining application is dismissed.
