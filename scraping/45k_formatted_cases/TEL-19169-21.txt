Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-19169-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BSMT, 1388 LAKEFIELD STREET OSHAWA ON L1J3Y9


 




Between:


Margaret Timoll


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Stephen Jesso


Tenant



 
 
 
Margaret
Timoll (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Stephen Jesso (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental
unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously
impaired the safety of any person. The Landlord also claimed compensation for
each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard in Video Conference Room 122 on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord,
Margaret Timoll, assisted by her son, Robert Timoll, and the Tenant, Stephen
Jesso, attended the hearing.
 
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The application
is dismissed because I find that the notice of termination on which it is based
is invalid due to insufficient details. The Landlord also provided no evidence
to support the grounds for termination in the notice.
 
2.    The details that are provided in the N7 Notice (‘the
Notice’) in support of the allegations of serious impairment of safety are a
single altercation between the Landlord and the Tenant on August 22, 2021. The three other occurrences listed on the
Notice, one dating back to August 13, 2019, involved allegations by another Tenant at the residential complex against the Tenant and the Landlord could
not provide any evidence to support the allegations nor did she have any direct
knowledge of the allegations.
 
3.    All of the allegations in the N7 Notice are dismissed
due to insufficient detail and because the Landlords could not make out a prima
facie case to support them. Therefore, the application is dismissed.
