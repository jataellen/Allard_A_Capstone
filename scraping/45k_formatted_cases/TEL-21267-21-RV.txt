Review Order
 
DD Acquistions Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Fessie
Guzman (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the
Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on June 16, 2021 with respect to
application TEL-14628-21.
 
This application was resolved
by order TEL-21267-21 issued on January
18, 2022.
 
On February
2, 2022 the Tenant requested a review and stay of the order
pending review. A preliminary
review of the review request was completed without a hearing.
Determinations:
 
1.     To put this request in context, the Board’s order in TEL-14628-21 required the Tenant to
pay to the Landlord:
 
•        
$5,600.00 towards the Tenant’s
arrears on or before July 10, 2021;
 
•        
$365.00 towards the Tenant’s
arrears on the 15th of each month commencing August 15, 2021; and,
 
•        
the regularly monthly rent on the 1st of the month until the arrears
are paid in full.
 
2.     Subsection 78(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’)
provides that:
 
78 (1) A landlord
may, without notice to the tenant, apply to the Board for an order terminating a tenancy or evicting the
tenant if the following criteria are satisfied:




 
1.    
The landlord previously applied
to the Board for an order terminating the tenancy or evicting the tenant.
 
2.    
A
settlement agreed to under section
194 or order made with respect to the previous application,
 
i.  
imposed conditions on the tenant
that, if not met by the tenant, would give rise to the same grounds
for terminating the tenancy as were claimed in the previous
application, and
 
ii.  
provided that the landlord
could apply under this section
if the tenant did not meet one
or more of the conditions described in subparagraph i.
 
3.    
The tenant has not met one or more of the conditions described in subparagraph 2 i.
 
3.     The Landlord filed an L4 Application asserting that the Tenant breached more than one of
the conditions set out in TEL-14628-21. In particular, the Landlord claimed
that the Tenant did not pay the rent for December 2021 on or before December 1,
2021 and that the Tenant did not pay $365.00 on or before December 15, 2021.
 
4.     The Board’s order in TEL-21267-21 finds that the Tenant breached
both conditions and orders the termination of the tenancy
and the eviction of the Tenant.
 
5.     The Tenant’s request to review asserts that there is a
serious error in the hearing order because the Tenant did pay her rent for
December 2021 on time. This is in
substance an assertion that there is an unreasonable finding of fact on a
material issue which would potentially change the result of the order (see Board Interpretation Guideline
8, Review of an Order under the heading
“Grounds for Review: Serious Error”).
 
6.     On this point,
the Tenant claims
that rent was given to the office
on December 1, 2021 by cheque. If this is correct, there is
an error in the Board’s order in that the order contains the following finding
of fact: “The Tenant did not pay $1,949.00 rent on or before December 1, 2021”.
 
7.     That being said, the hearing
order also contains
the following finding
of fact: “The Tenant
did not pay $365.00 arrears on or before December 15, 2021.”
 
8.     On this point,
the Tenant’s request
to review admits
that the Tenant
was unable to make
payments towards the Tenant’s arrears.
 
9.     What the Tenant’s admission means is that even if the
Board did err in finding that the December 1, 2021 payment was not made on time, the Board’s
conclusion was still within
the range of reasonable outcomes. By this I mean that the Board
was entitled to issue the order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant if the Tenant “has not met one or more of the conditions”
set out in order TEL-14628-21. Since the Tenant’s request to review admits that
the Tenant did not meet one of these conditions, the Board was




 
entitled to issue the order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. Put differently,
there is in my view no
arguable merit to the
Tenant’s claim of a serious error because the result of the order would have been the same
regardless of whether the Tenant paid the rent on December 1, 2021.
 
10.  For the sake of completeness, I should note that the
Board did take into account the Tenant’s payment of $1,949.00 on December 1,
2021. According to the Board’s record, the Landlord applied part of this
payment to the Tenant’s outstanding arrears and part of this payment
to the Tenant’s rent for December 2021. I mention
this to clarify
that there is no ascertainable calculation error with
respect to the amount the Member ordered the Tenant to pay in order
TEL-21267-21.
 
11.  For all of the above reasons, I am not satisfied that there is a serious
error in the order or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review order
TEL-21267-21 issued on January 18, 2022 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
