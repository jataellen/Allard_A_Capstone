Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99195-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


7, 180 GOLF COURSE ROAD PEMBROKE ON K8A7B5


 




Between:


Stephen Scott


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Mathew Phillips


Tenant



 
 
On January 10, 2022, Stephen Scott (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Mathew Phillips (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant entered into an
agreement to terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord filed an L3 application on January 10,
2022 which includes and N11 Agreement to End the Tenancy
signed by Landlord
and Tenant, with a termination date of December 31,
2021.
 
2.     The Landlord submitted a declaration which
noted that the Tenant vacated
the rental unit on or before the termination date
contained in the N11.
 
3.     As the tenancy
has already terminated and the Tenant had returned vacant
possession to the Landlord,
before the Landlord filed the application, the Landlord’s application seeking
termination of tenancy is moot and therefore will not be considered.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed
 
 
February 2, 2022
