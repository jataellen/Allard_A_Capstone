Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43775-21



In the matter
of:


174 SUTTON PLACE
SAULT STE MARIE ON P6A6B4


 




Between:


Fleming &
  Smith


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


 
Kayla Henry Scott McKechnie


 
Tenants



 
 
Fleming & Smith (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Scott McKechnie and Kayla Henry (the 'Tenants')
because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by video conference on December 2, 2021.
The Landlord's Agent, Andrew Raplenovic, and the Tenant, Scott McKechnie,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from June
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective August 19, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,100.00.
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
5.    
The Tenants
moved into the rental unit in January
2020 and faced some challenges in the
family. Although the Tenant has been employed since August 2019 and earns
approximately $2,200.00 every two weeks, he
failed to pay any portion of the outstanding arrears.
6.     The Landlord is not holding
a last month's rent deposit.
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties
and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act. The amount outstanding is substantial, and the Tenants have not paid any rent




 
since the application was filed. The Tenant proposed
to pay the full amount
owed, inclusive of January
2022 rent, by January 1, 2022.
It is ordered
that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants is terminated. The
Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $9,049.52*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $36.16 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 17, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January 18, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
January 18, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 17, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $10,101.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after January 18, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession
to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
