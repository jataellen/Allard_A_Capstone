Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-23972-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


403, 104 NELSON
STREET BRANTFORD ON N3T6J8


 




Between:


Your Homes Of Brantford


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Shauna
Rowe


Tenant



 
 
 
Your Homes Of Brantford (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Shauna Rowe (the 'Tenant') on the basis the Tenant ‘s behaviour, or
the behaviour of someone visiting or living with the Tenant has substantially
interfered with another Tenant’s or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the
residential complex and/or lawful rights, privileges, or interests.
 
This application was heard by videoconference
on November 10, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s
Representative K. Boswell
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
The Landlord brought
this application, on the basis the Tenant’s behaviour, or the behaviour of
someone visiting or living with the Tenant has substantially interfered with
another tenant’s or the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex and/or lawful rights, privileges, or interests.
 
2.    The residential unit is
comprised of approximately 60 residential units.
 
3.    The Tenant is still in possession of the rental
unit.
 
4.   
This is the second Form
N5 served upon the Tenant. The
Landlord’s first Form N5 was served August 4, 2021, containing similar types of allegations as the
second Form N5. The
Landlord was required to provide the
Tenant with 7 days to void the first
N5 in accordance with section 64(2)(c) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act').
 
5.   
Since the first event
in the Landlord’s second Form N5
(dated August 6, 2021) occurred only
2 days after the service of the Landlord’s first Form N5, I will not consider
this event.




 
6.   
The second and final
event in the Landlord’s second Form N5 occurred on August 18, 2021 and alleges
the Tenant was not prepared for the treatment of cockroaches.
 
7.   
The Tenant was given
advanced notice of entry for August 18, 2021 so the Landlord’s contractor could
enter the Tenant’s unit and treat all bedbugs/cockroaches. The Landlord submits
that the Tenant failed to empty her garbage, clean her kitchen and remove the
clutter from the rental unit, as required in order to prepare the unit for
treatment. The Landlord produced
pictures showing the unit extremely cluttered, with boxes, clothes, dishes, an
animal cage, and garbage all over the floors, counters and furniture.
 
8.   
I find on a balance of
probabilities that the Tenant’s behaviour has substantially interfered with the
Landlord’s lawful rights, privileges, or interests by preventing the Landlord
from performing his maintenance obligations and ridding the building of the
cockroaches.
 
9.   
Section 83 requires that I consider
all the circumstances in the case, including the Tenant’s
and the Landlord’s situations, to determine whether it would be appropriate to
delay or deny eviction in the form of section 83 relief. In my view, it would not be unfair to deny the eviction so long
as the rental unit is returned to a state of cleanliness in a reasonable period
of time. I appreciate the Landlord’s concerns with the state of the rental
unit, however if the unit is returned to an acceptable standard and maintained
in an acceptable manner, those concerns will be satisfied. As a result,
conditional relief will be granted on the terms set out below.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
On or before January
31, 2022, the Tenant shall remove all clutter and garbage from the rental unit.
 
2.    
For the six-month period commencing February 1, 2022 and ending on July 31, 2022, the Tenant shall ensure the
rental unit is in an accessible and clutter-free state for all pest control
treatments.
 
3.    
If the Tenant breaches
paragraphs 1 or 2 of this order, the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the Board pursuant
to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant. The Landlord
must make this application no later than 30 days after
the Tenant’s breach of paragraphs 1 or 2 of this order.
