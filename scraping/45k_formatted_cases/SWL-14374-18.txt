Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-14374-18











 
 

KD (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict CB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not
pay the rent that the Tenant owes (‘L1’ application).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right,
privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; and because the Tenant
or another occupant of the rental unit has committed an illegal act or has
carried out, or permitted someone to carry out an illegal trade, business or
occupation in the rental unit or the residential complex. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date (‘L2’ application).
 
This application was heard in [CITY] on May
8, 2018.  The Landlord and the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, GL attended the hearing.  The Landlord's witnesses, LG and ST,
also attended the hearing.  As of 11:05 a.m., the Tenant was not present or
represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application: 
1.     
The Tenant did not pay the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from February 1, 2018
to May 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective February 24, 2018.
2.     
The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     
The monthly rent is $1,000.00.
4.     
The application is amended to reflect that the
Landlord is not holding a last month's rent deposit. 
5.     
The Tenant has made no payments since the
application was filed. 
6.     
No circumstances were
disclosed in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), to suggest the Board ought to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.  
The L2 Application:
7.     
I have considered the
totality of the Landlord’s evidence including the oral testimony of his current
tenant, ST and a prior tenant, LG as well as the documents provided to the
Board.  I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord did not
establish the allegations made in the Notice to End Your Tenancy for
Interfering with Others, Damages or Overcrowding (N5) or the Notice to
Terminate a Tenancy Early Illegal Act or Misrepresentation of Income (N6) and
as a result termination of the tenancy is not warranted on this basis.  
8.     
I have no doubt that the
Landlord believes the allegations made in the notices provided to the Tenant
and I have no doubt that the Tenant is smoking in the rental unit.  However,
the Landlords conclusion that the Tenant is smoking marijuana is based on a
subjective interpretation of the smell of smoke and is not corroborated by any
objective third party.  
9.     
It is not clear to me that
the smell of smoke, even if it is marijuana, is not coming from an open window
or other entry to the residential complex.  This is because the Landlord did
not perform an inspection which found that marijuana was being smoked in the
rental unit, and relied only on the smell throughout the building.  
10.   LG and ST testified that they often smelled what
they believed to be smoke originating from the burning of marijuana.  However,
neither could state with certainty that the smell couldn’t be something else.  
11.   LG refused to move in to the upstairs rental
unit as a result of the strong smell of smoke, but LG admitted that she never
observed the Tenant smoking any substance within the residential complex.  
12.   ST testified that both cannabis and cigarette
smoke were smelled within the complex “coming up through the vent” from the
basement apartment.  However, ST also admitted that, she could not verify the
odours were caused by the Tenant, and did not observe the Tenant smoking any
substance in the rental unit.  
13.   The Landlord also testified at this hearing. 
The Landlord stated that his wife and son told him the
odour allegedly emanating from the basement unit was cannabis.  This is second
hand information and I did not consider it persuasive as a result.  That is,
the Landlord was unable to identify the smell personally and therefore cannot
comment on the cause of the smell with clarity or certainty.  I find this
evidence insufficient to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant
engaged in an illegal act in the residential complex.  Therefore, the portion
of the L2 application attributable to the N6 is dismissed. 
14.   Similarly, the Landlord sought to terminate the tenancy for
substantial interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential
complex as it relates to the other tenants surrounding this rental unit. 
Again, the evidence provided was insufficient in my view to determine that the
Tenant was smoking marijuana in the rental unit and therefore, insufficient to
conclude that the Tenant substantially interfered with the other tenants’
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex. 
15.   The tenancy agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant does not
prohibit smoking.  Therefore, the fact that the Tenant likely smoked some
substance in this rental unit is not sufficient grounds to terminate the
tenancy in my view.  As a result, the balance of the L2 application is also
dismissed.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Landlord’s L2
application is dismissed.
2.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order relating to the L1 as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and
the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or
before June 10, 2018.
3.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $3,912.64*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to May 30, 2018.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
May 31, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
5.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
6.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June 10, 2018, the Tenant will
start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from June 11,
2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
7.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before June 10, 2018, then starting June 11, 2018, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
8.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 11, 2018.
9.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $4,190.00 if the payment is made on or before May 31, 2018, or
ii)       $5,190.00 if the payment is made on or before June 10, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
10.   The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after June 11, 2018 but before the Sheriff
gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this
motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
