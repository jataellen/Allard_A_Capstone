Order under Section
31
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TET-06547-19
 
 
 
 
 
OK and KK (the
'Tenants') applied for an order determining that WJ (the 'Landlord') entered the rental unit illegally; changed
the locks of the rental
unit without giving a
replacement key; and, substantially interfered with the Tenants’ reasonable
enjoyment.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on May 11, 2021. The Tenants and the Landlord attended the hearing. The
Tenants declined to speak with Duty Counsel prior to the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
Preliminary Issues
 
1.    
On February 11, 2020
the Tenants emailed the Board, and served the Landlord, to amend their
application to include
that the Landlord
changed the locks
of the rental unit without
giving a replacement key and substantially interfered with the Tenants’
reasonable enjoyment. The amendment is accepted as I was received prior to the
hearing date and was not disputed by the Landlord.
 
2.    
During the Landlord’s
testimony it came to light that due to a misunderstanding the Landlord did not
forward his disclosure to the Tenants. Therefore, it was agreed that; the
Landlord would forward his disclosure via email to the Tenants on or before May
14, 2020; the Tenants would respond to the evidence ad include their closing
submission to the Landlord and submit to the Board by May 21, 2020; and the Landlord would send his closing submissions to the Tenant and the Board no later than May 28, 2020. The parties complied, as such their
post-hearing submissions form part of this order.
 
Merits
 
3.    
For the reasons that
follow I find the Landlord entered the rental unit illegal and substantially inferred
with the Tenants
reasonable enjoyment contrary
to the legislation. I find
the Landlord did not alter the locking system on the rental unit.




 
 
 
4.    
It is undisputed hat the Tenants
moved into the rental unit on May 15, 2017. The monthly rent was $1,762.00.
 
Evidence
Tenants’ Testimony
 
5.    
(KK) testified
that on August 19, 2019 they
gave the Landlord
a notice of termination for October 31, 2019. A
copy of the notice was entered into evidence.
 
6.    
On October 4, 2019 the
Tenants left the property but still had valuables in the unit. They kept their keys with the intention
of coming back to
get the rest of their property plus do a final cleaning.
 
7.    
On October 22, 2019,
the Landlord emailed asking if he could enter the unit on October 26, 2019, to carry out an inspection
with respect to what needed done to re-rent the unit;
the Tenants agreed.
 
8.    
On October 30, 2019,
(OK) returned to the unit to do a final cleaning and leave the keys. When she
entered the unit, she saw someone else’s belongings had been moved
into the unit. There was also a dog in the unit, it started barking
and coming towards her, therefore she shut the door; the dog stood up against
the door so she
could not re-enter. OK took pictures of the new people’s property; these
pictures were entered into evidence.
 
9.    
OK tried phoning the
Landlord right away to find out what was going on; OK reached the Landlord on
her third attempt, the phone logs were entered into evidence. The Landlord
stated that he thought they had
already moved out so when the now tenants asked if they could move in early, he agreed. The
Landlord said he would partially reimburse them; therefore, she left the keys
in the mailbox. Before leaving, OK spoke to the neighbours, who said the new
tenants moved in October 26, 2019.
 
10.  On October
30, 2019 KK emailed the Landlord about new people moving in prior to
the termination of their lease on October 31, 2019, the termination date they
gave. KK requested a minimum of one-week’s rent and to not be responsible for
the utility costs since they were not physically in the unit since October
3, 2010. On November 1, 2019,
the Landlord replied that he was not aware of the situation, that it was not
his problem, and the utility bills would be forwarded with payment
expected/pursued.
 
Landlord’s Testimony
 
11.  The Landlord testified that as the email entered into evidence indicates, he inspected the rental unit to make sure it was
prepared for the new Tenants who were moving in on November 1, 2019.
 
12.   When asked if the people he rented to were the same
as who were in the unit when OK
went on October 30, 2019, the Landlord replied yes; but he said he did not know
how




 
they got the keys. The
Landlord suggested that perhaps the Real Estate
Agent gave them the keys.
 
13.  The Landlord entered
into evidence pictures
he took from the inspection on October 27, 2019
that shows the unit was empty.
 
14.  The Landlord also testified that the Sunday or Monday
prior to October 30, 2019,
when OK called him about people
already in the unit,
OK said she would be bringing the keys
on the 30th; he thanked her for the good state of cleanliness they left
the unit in.
 
15.  The Landlord further testified that when OK
phone him on October 30th,
he told her she could call the police because
someone else was on the unit or he would
reimburse them.
 
Analysis
 
16.  Section 24 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (he ‘Act’) which says:
 
A landlord shall not alter the locking
system on a door giving
entry to a rental unit or
residential complex or cause the locking system to be altered during the
tenant’s occupancy of the rental unit without giving the tenant replacement
keys.
 
17.  The Tenants’ testimony is that when OK entered
the rental unit on October
30, 2019, she found other people were already
living there; she realized this upon using her keys to enter the unit.
Therefore, I find the Landlord did not change the locks; accordingly, this part
of the application must be dismissed.
 
18.  Section 27(1) of the Act says that a
landlord may enter a rental unit to conduct a unit inspection “in accordance with written notice
given to the tenant at least 24 hours before the time of entry”.
 
19.  The Tenants testified that the Landlord
emailed on October 22, 2019 to inspect the unit and do any necessary repairs on October
26, 2019. The email
correspondence between the parties establishes that the Landlord asked
for entry prior to November 1, 2019. When the Tenants asked what date, the
Landlord responded, “the coming weekend would be great”.
 
20.  Section 27(3) of the Act says that the
notice of entry “shall specify the reason for entry, the day of entry, and a time of entry between
8 a.m. and 8 p.m.”. Here the notice does not include a specific day or time; it is unclear on the
evidence if the Tenants consented to
the Landlord’s vague timing with respect to entry.
 
21.  In Wrona v.
Toronto Community Housing
Corporation (January 24, 2007) Toronto Docket No. 374/06, [2007] O.J. No. 423
(Div.Ct.), the court found at paragraph 6 that consent to entry does not
“operate as a waiver of the requirement of the notice”. Therefore, as the
Landlord’s notice of entry did not include a specific date or time, I find it
is contrary to section 27(3) of the Act. Therefore, it was an illegal entry
when the Landlord entered the




 
unit on October 27, 2019. As such, the Tenant may be entitled
to remedy, which to be
discussed under “Remedy” below.
 
22. 
Section 22 of the Act says:
 
A landlord shall not at any time during a tenant’s occupancy of a
rental unit and before the day on which an order evicting the tenant is
executed substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental
unit or the residential complex in which it is located for all
usual purposes by a tenant or members of his or her household.
 
23.  Here, the substantial interference is that there were new tenants
living in the rental unit prior to the termination date given
by the Tenants.
 
24.  The Landlord testified
that he does not know how
the new tenants got in early as he did not give them a key; it was postulated
that the Real Estate Agent could have given it to them.
 
25.  I find it unlikely that the Landlord would
not know that the new tenants had moved in early, however, even if this is the
case, then the only logical explanation is the Real Estate Agent gave them the keys. This finding is supported
by the Landlord’s email dated September 6, 2019 that indicates his
Real Estate Agent will be acting on his behalf with respect to re-renting the
unit. Therefore, as an Agent of the Landlord, the Landlord is responsible for
the Agent’s behaviour, and consequently, the Landlord is responsible for the
new tenants being allowed into the rental unit prior to the termination date
given by the Tenants.
 
26.  The issue now becomes
determining when the new tenants
took possession. The Tenant’
email says the neighbour told them the new people
moved in the weekend of October 26, 2019. However, the pictures
the Landlord took on October 27, 2019, and time-stamped the same date, show
that the rental unit did not have any belongings in it during his inspection.
 
27.  Therefore, based on the Tenants’ email
dated October 30, 2019, and the Landlord’s inability to offer an alternative date,
I find that the new tenants moved in
Monday, October 28, 2019; the
day closest to the weekend indicated in the email.
 
28.  With respect to when the tenancy was
terminated, I find the Landlord received vacant possession mid-afternoon on October 30, 2019, when OK left the keys in the mailbox and advised him of same.
 
29.  Based on all of the above, I find the
Landlord substantially interfered with the Tenants’ reasonable enjoyment
contrary to section 22 of the Act when the unit was re-rented on October 28, 2019, one and a half days prior to when the Landlord was entitled to vacant
possession. As such the Tenants may be entitled to remedy; to be discussed
under “Remedy” below.




 
30.  It should be noted that the
utility bills the Landlord entered
into evidence are not part of
this order as they do not form part of the Tenants application.
 
Remedy
 
31.  The Tenants requested the following remedies: rent abatement in the amount of $345.00;
the Landlord be fined $1,000.00; out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of
$200.00; and pain and suffering in the amount of $1,000.00.
 
32.  With respect to an abatement
of the rent, an abatement
is designed to address the idea
that a tenant is paying for a bundle of goods and services and if the tenant is
not receiving the full bundle then the rent should be abated proportionate to
the difference between what is being paid for and what is being received.
 
33. 
Here
the reasoning for an abatement of $345.00 was that the unit was re-rented 6-days
prior to when the Landlord was entitled to vacant possession. Based on my
above- analysis, I found that the new tenants took possession 1 ½ days prior to
when the Landlord was entitled
to vacant possession; therefore, I find the Tenants
are entitled to an abatement for this 1 ½ day period in
the amount of $86.90, calculated as follows:
 
Rent $1,762.00 X 12 months/year = $21,144.00
$21,144.00 ÷ 365 days/year
= $57.93 per diem
$57.93 X 1.5 days = $86.90
 
34.  With respect to the Landlord being fined $1,000.00,
the Tenants requested this amount because he mislead
them about the reason for his entry the weekend
of October 26, 209 and his denial of having any
knowledge as to the new tenants moving in early.
 
35.  Based on my above analysis, I found that
the new tenants moved in October 28, 2019; therefore, there the Tenants were
not mislead about the Landlord’s inspection October 27, 2019.With respect to the Landlord
denying knowledge of the new tenants being in the unit, although I found this denial
unlikely, I also found the Landlord was responsible for the above noted period.
 
36. 
The Board’s
Interpretation Guideline 16 says:
 
An administrative fine is a remedy to be used by the Board to encourage compliance with the Act and to deter landlords from engaging in similar activity
in the future. This remedy
is not normally imposed unless a landlord has shown a blatant disregard for the
Act and other remedies will not provide adequate deterrence and compliance.
37.  In all of the circumstances here I do not believe
an administrative fine is warranted. The Tenants received an
abatement for the period in question, and the Landlord’s conduct was not a
“blatant disregard for the Act”; I found on a balance of probabilities that the




 
Real Estate
Agent gave the new tenants
the keys, and it is possible that the Landlord may not have known this.
Accordingly, the Tenants request for a fine is denied.
 
38.  As for the Tenants request
for out-of-pocket expenses, there was insufficient testimony or evidence
to support a claim for out-of-pocket expenses; accordingly, this request is denied.
 
39.  In regard to the Tenants request for an
award of damages based on pain and suffering; the Tenants submitted that they suffered stress because of not having access
to their unit caused, and the danger the new
tenant’s dog caused when OK entered the unit. The Tenants also submitted that
the Landlord disrespected them when he reneged on compensating them for letting
people in early and refusing to cover their utilities when they basically had
not stayed in the unit since October 4, 2019.
 
40.  As already expressed, abatement represents the difference between
what is being paid
for and what is being received. It is the usual remedy awarded in landlord and
tenant matters. Damages are generally reserved for those situations where
abatement fails to compensate for harm suffered by the tenant.
 
41.  Here, the Tenants were compensated via
abatement. There was no testimony or evidence
to support n award for pain and suffering. Where a landlord’s behaviour is such that it causes great distress and
upset an award for damages in the nature of pain and suffering is appropriate
because abatement is inadequate to compensate for those intangible losses. This
is not the case here.
 
42.  Further, based on my findings that the new
tenancy ended October 28, 2019, OK feeling fear because of the dog is not
within the Board’s jurisdiction as the event occurred on October 30, 2019. As for the Tenants submission that the
Landlord was disrespectful and dismissive during
mediation and the initial hearing, no evidence
or testimony was led
with respect to such behaviour.
 
43.  Therefore,
based on all of the above, the Tenant’s request
for an award of pain and suffering is denied.
 
44.  Under my analysis I found that the
Landlord’s entry on October 7, 2019 was contrary to section 27 of the Act.
In Beauge v. Metcap Living
Management Inc., [2012] O.J. No. 1052 (Div. Ct.) , the court said it is not
open to the Board to order an amount in excess of that claimed in an application which has not been amended. Here, the Tenant did not request remedy for the illegal entry,
therefore no remedy can be awarded.
 
45.  It should be noted that any reference
to the Tenant being abated with respect to utility
bills does not form part of this order as it is not part of the Landlord and
Tenant relationship, and accordingly is beyond the Board’s jurisdiction.
 
46.  As the Tenants
were partially successful in their application, they are entitled
to reimbursement of their filing fee.
