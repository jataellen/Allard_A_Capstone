214 WILSON ROAD S
  OSHAWA ON L1H6C3


 




Between:


Bo Fu Li


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kevin White
Loretta
Lynn Diskey


Tenants



 
 
 
Bo Fu Li (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Kevin White and Loretta Lynn Diskey (the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently late in paying
their rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants
remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard by video conference on October 26, 2021.
 
At 10:58 am the Landlord’s Representative Carrie Aylwin attended the hearing. The Tenants we not present nor represented at the hearing.
 
 
Determinations and Reasons:
 
1.     The Tenants have persistently failed
to pay the rent on the date it
was due.
 
2.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April
19, 2018 to September 30, 2021.
 
Persistently Late
 
 
4.    
Pursuant to subsection 58(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’):
 
A landlord may give a tenant notice
of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following grounds:




 
1.    The tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date
if becomes due and payable.
 
The termination date set out on the notice must be at the end of the term or period
of the tenancy.
 
5.    
The Landlord
served the Tenants
with a Notice to Terminate
the Tenancy at the End of
Term (N8 notice) on July 8, 2021. The termination date set out in the N8 Notice
is September 30, 2021.
 
Evidence
and Testimony
 
6.    
It was the uncontested testimony and evidence
of the Landlord’s Representative that the
Tenants were persistently late in paying rent on the date it was due.
 
7.    
According to the ledger
attached to the N8 notice,
the Tenants had been late or not paid
in full the rent owing from July 2020 through to and including June 2021.
 
8.    
The Landlord’s Representative indicated that the Tenants
has not paid any rent since the filing of the application.
 
9.    
It was the uncontested evidence of the Landlord’s Representative that arrears are now in excess of $10 000.00 and it is
unlikely that the Tenants would be able to pay the lawful monthly rent and the
arrears.
 
10.  According to the Landlord’s Representative,
several attempts have been made to communicate
with the Tenants and a payment
plan was offered
on or around September 22,
2021, with no response from the Tenants.
 
11.  When asked about the circumstances of the
Tenants and any consideration that should be made in relation to delaying or
denying eviction, the Landlord’s Representative indicated that the Tenants,
despite several communication attempts, did not respond and chose not to participate in the
hearing.
 
12. 
I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find
that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
January 31, 2022. The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$3,329.02, which represents compensation for the use of the unit from October 1, 2021
to January 12, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.




 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $46.03 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from January 13, 2022 to
the date they move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
which is the cost of the application filing fee.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before January 31, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
