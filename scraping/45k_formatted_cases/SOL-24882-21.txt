Jessica Genereaux


Tenant



 
 
 
Robinson Apartments Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Jessica Genereaux (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 11, 2022.
 
The Landlord's Legal Representative, Anne Skelly, and the Tenant's
Legal Representative, Silvat Syed, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from
September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
18, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,815.00.
 
4.     The Tenant paid $8,027.20 after
the application was filed.
 
5.    
The only amount outstanding is the Landlord's cost of filing
the application. As a result, the order will be limited to
costs only and not eviction.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.




 
2.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before
February 1, 2022, the Tenant will
start to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from February 2, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
