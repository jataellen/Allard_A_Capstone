C.P.A.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict N.W.
and S.M. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent. The
Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the
unit after the termination date.  This is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on January 5, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative, S.B., and the Tenants attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective November 5, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord submitted an Update Sheet at the hearing, which shows the rental
arrears of $5,363.55 to January 31, 2018.   The Tenants agree with the amount
of arrears the Landlord has claimed.
3.     The
Tenants stated they wished to remain in the rental unit; however, they do not
have the income to maintain the tenancy and pay off the arrears.  While both
Tenants suffer from mental illness and are trying their best to keep up with
the rent, they have fallen behind.  
4.     They
have had odd jobs here and there but provided no evidence of an income that
would support their rent and arrears.  They stated they would be able to pay
$2,000.00 towards the arrears but had no substantial plan to pay the rest of
the arrears.
5.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,060.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2018
to November 5, 2017.
7.     The
Tenants paid $15.90 after the application was filed.
L2
APPLICATION
8.      The
Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due.  The
Tenants agree they have been paying the rent late.
9.      The
Notice of Termination for persistently late rent shows the Tenants have not
paid their rent on time since November, 2016.  This notice was served on the
Tenants by mail on November 10, 2017 and the Tenants still made no payment of
rent after receiving the notice.
10.   The
Landlord requested a non-remedial order for the arrears and termination of the
tenancy.
11.  I
understand the Tenants are attempting to overcome their financial difficulties;
however, I am not satisfied that prolonging the tenancy will benefit their
situation.  I believe it may be financially detrimental to the Tenants to
continue the tenancy.  For this reason, the tenancy is terminated based on the
notice of termination for persistently late payment of rent.
12.  The
Tenants requested the termination be delayed by 30 days.  The Landlord was
willing to agree to an extension of January 31, 2018.  As this date has passed
and to delay the termination beyond the standard 11 days would be prejudicial to
the Landlord as the rent arrears continue to increase, no delay in termination
is granted.
13.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
14.  This
order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.  
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 16, 2018.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,509.22*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to February 5, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $35.37 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 6, 2018 to the date they move out of the
unit.
4.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 16, 2018, the Tenants will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 16, 2018, then starting February
17, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 17,
2018.
