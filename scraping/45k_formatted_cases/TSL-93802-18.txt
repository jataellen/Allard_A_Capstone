Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TSL-93802-18
 










 
 

C.L.P
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.S
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on April 9, 2018.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, S.C (“SC”) and the Tenant
(who was self-represented) attended the hearing.
 
 At the hearing the Tenant raised the
following issues pursuant to section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'): 
 
1.    the
lack of security in the residential complex (with the back door being
consistently propped open;
2.    The
depression in the floor of one of the bedrooms;
3.    Bedbugs
in the unit and the residential complex. 
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
February 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective February 23, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant paid $775.00 after the application was filed.
 
3.      SC
submitted a written summary of the Landlord’s claims at the hearing, which
showed arrears of rent to the hearing date of $1,407.73 and a filing fee of
$190.00 for a total claim of $1,597.73. 
 
4.      The
Tenant did not dispute the amount of the Landlord’s claims but a) requested
time to pay the requested amounts until June 20, 2018 b) raised the above-noted
issues under s.82 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (“the Act”).
Section 82 issues 
Security of Residential Complex
5.      The
Tenant testified that the Landlord’s staff is consistently propping open the
back door of the residential complex such that the building is left open to any
member of the public who wants access to it.  She submitted into evidence
undated photographs of the back door area, variously showing the back door
open, and crouching male figures outside of the building.  The Tenant alleged
that as a result of this ongoing lax security of the building, she has had a
number of people harass her; although the dates, times or any documentation
speaking to these incidents were not provided.
 
6.      The
Tenant played an audio recording at the hearing which she indicated revealed an
admission by Landlord’s staff of the poor security in the building.
Depression
in Bedroom
7.      The
Tenant also alleged that in the 2nd bedroom of the unit, there is a
large depression/sink-hole in the middle of the floor.  The Tenant testified
that she brought this issue to the attention of the Landlord early on in the
tenancy but to date, nothing has been done about the problem.
 
8.      The
Tenant submitted into evidence a work order submitted to the property manager
of the building dated April 18, 2017.   The Tenant described that this
document, completed by the staff member in the office based upon the Tenant’s
information, states: “Please check the floor in the bedroom.   The Tenant
cannot put furniture inside.”
 
9.      The
Tenant described that notwithstanding her request for maintenance to the
Landlord of almost a year ago, nothing has been done by the Landlord about this
issue, leaving the Tenant unable, for all practical purposes, to use the
bedroom as a bedroom, forcing her daughter – the intended resident of the
bedroom – to sleep in the living room.
Bedbugs
10.   The
Tenant described that she lives 4 feet away from the laundry room of the building
which continues to show problems with the presence of bedbugs.
 
11.   The
Tenant elaborated that she has also seen bedbugs in her unit on at least three
occasions between August 2017 and October 2017.
 
12.   The
Tenant had no documentation concerning her allegations re: bedbugs or any
photographs available for the hearing.
 
13.   The
Tenant conceded that the Landlord has sprayed her unit on about 6 occasions as
well as the hallways, with the result that her unit no longer has any bedbug
presence.  However, she noted, the laundry room still shows the presence of
bedbugs.
 
14.   With
respect to the totality of the s.82 issues raised, the Tenant requested the
remedy of a 50% rent abatement for a period of a year.
Landlord’s Position on the
s.82 Issues
15.   SC,
on behalf of the Landlord, indicated that having no previous notice of the s.82
issues, the Landlord was unable to bring responding evidence to the hearing to
address the testimony of the Tenants on these issues.
 
16.   SC
submitted that no rent abatement should issue with respect to any issue raised
by the Tenant, noting that the Tenant’s evidence was preponderantly lacking in
specifics (including dates/times/particulars as well as documentary support.
 
17.   Further,
SC noted that the Landlord had arranged for a contractor to attend the unit on
April 4, 2018.
Analysis
of s.82 issues
18.   Recently,
the Ontario Court of Appeal, in its decision in Onyskiw v. CJM Property
Management Ltd 2016 ONCA 477 (“Onyskiw”), set out a new framework for
analysis of alleged breaches of a landlord’s duties, and particularly the duty
to repair under s.20 of the Act.
 
19.   In
that case, the Court of Appeal abandoned the view that any service interruption
or problem (like the ones raised by the Tenant in this case) constitutes
automatic breaches of the Act (para. 58).  Instead, the Court urged the Board
to make a “contextual analysis” in each case, looking at all the facts of the
situation before finding that a Landlord breached the Act (para. 84).  As part
of this analysis, the Court directed the Board to look at the essential nature
of a tenant’s complaints (para. 86) and what steps, if any, were taken by the
landlord (para. 19-21).
 
20.   I
find that no rent abatement should be granted to the Tenant with respect to the
backdoor of the complex being left open.   The Tenant’s evidence in this
respect, as urged by SC, was generally unclear, lacking in specifics and
wanting in documentary support.  The audio tape played at the hearing, on a
balance of probabilities, did not persuade me, in view of its lack of clarity
and specifics, that the Landlord had contravened the Act.
 
21.   Similarly,
the Tenant’s complaint concerning bedbugs falls short of demonstrating a breach
of the Act. The case law in this area, including Onyskiw, recognizes
that while it is ultimately a landlord’s responsibility to deal with pests in a
rental unit, the mere presence of bedbugs in a unit is not properly a basis for
finding that the Landlord breached s.20 of the Act.  On a “contextual analysis”
(as urged by the Court in Onyskiw) if a Landlord provides a timely and
effective response to a pest problem, no remedy generally flows to a tenant(s). 
In this case, I find that the Landlord made a timely, and largely effective
response to the bedbug issue in both the complex and the unit.  I see no
grounds to find –on this basis –a breach of s.20 of the Act by the Landlord or
grounds to award a remedy to the Tenant.
 
22.   However,
in my view, the depression in the bedroom of the unit is a different matter.  I
am persuaded, on the evidence presented at the hearing by the Tenant, that the
unit has a large “sinkhole” in one bedroom of the unit which was reported to
the Landlord, in writing, by the Tenant, nearly one year ago.   The essentially
uncontradicted evidence before me is that nothing has been done about this
issue –for this same period of time (although it is conceded that on April 4,
2018, a contractor was sent to the unit).  On a contextual analysis, the big
picture here is of the Tenant paying for the use of an apartment for a year,
and not getting full use out of one of the bedrooms.  In my determination, this
failure to address the issue for nearly a year constitutes a breach of s.20 of
the Act by the Landlord.
 
23.   Abatement
of rent is a contractual remedy based upon the idea that in providing rent, a
tenant is paying for a bundle of goods and services and when the tenant does
not receive 100% of what she or he paid for, a tenant is entitled to the return
of an amount roughly equivalent to the value the tenant paid for but did not
get.
 
24.   Here,
with respect to the issue in the bedroom, I believe that a lump sum rent
abatement in the amount of $500.00 is appropriate.  
 
25.   I
find that the Tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent of $500.00.
 
26.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
It
is ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $710.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 13, 2018 and less the amount of the rent
abatement the Landlord owes the Tenant.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $31.47 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 1, 2018 to the date she moves out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April 30,
2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after May 1, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before April 30, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,097.73** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 30, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
