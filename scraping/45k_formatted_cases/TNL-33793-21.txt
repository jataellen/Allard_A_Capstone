Anna Coscarelli Guido Coscarelli


Tenants



 
Maria
Digiuseppe (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Guido Coscarelli and Anna Coscarelli (the 'Tenants') because
the Landlord requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of
residential occupation.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 18, 2021.
Only the Landlord's Legal Representative John Spina attended the hearing.
The Tenants were not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     This is an application under
section 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act).
 
2.     Subsection 48(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) which states in part:
“a landlord
may, by notice, terminate a tenancy if the landlord
in good faith requires
possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation by
(a)  the landlord,
(b)  the landlord’s spouse, or
(c)  a child or parent
of the landlord or the landlord’s spouse.
 
3.     On June 16, 2021 the Landlord served the Tenants
a (N12) Notice to End the Tenancy setting out that the Landlord
requires possession of the rental unit for the following reason.
•        
use by a child of the Landlord.
 
4.     The termination date in the (N12) notice
was July 31, 2021.
5.    
The Tenants did not move out of the rental unit in accordance with the termination date set out in the notice given.




 
6.    
The technical requirements for granting an application under section 48 of the Act are
(a)  
The Notice:
 
48(2) The date for termination specified in a notice shall be at least 60
days after the notice is given and shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or,
where the tenancy is for a fixed
term, the end of the term.
(b)  
Declaration or Affidavit
 
Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires
the Landlord to file an affidavit/declaration sworn by
the person who personally requires the rental unit and that person certifying that they in good faith
requires the rental unit for his or her own personal use for at least one year.
(c)  
Compensation
 
Section 48.1 of the Act requires
a landlord who has served a tenant with an N12 notice pursuant to section 48 to pay
compensation to the tenants in an amount equal to one month’s rent.
Section 55.1 of
the Act requires the compensation must be paid no later than on the termination date specified in the N12 notice of termination given
by the Landlord under
section 48.
 
7.    
I
was satisfied that the Landlord has met the technical requirements for an application
under section 48 of the Act.
a.   
the Notice has been properly given,
 
b.   
a Declaration was filed and sworn to be given
in good faith,
 
c.   
compensation was duly paid to the
Tenants
 
8.     The Landlord's Legal Representative requested
a standard order
to termination of the
tenancy.
 
9.     The Tenants did not attend
the hearing to make submissions for relief from eviction.
 
10.  Based on the uncontested application, and after
considering all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant
to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
11.  The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $2,350.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. The deposit shall be applied to the
last month of the tenancy.
 
12.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decision within
the order. No other reasons
will be issued.




 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated, as of
November 30, 2021. The Tenants must
have move out of the rental unit on or before November 30, 2021.
 
2.    
If the unit was not vacated on or
before November 30, 2021, then starting December 1, 2021, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after December 1, 2021.

calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
