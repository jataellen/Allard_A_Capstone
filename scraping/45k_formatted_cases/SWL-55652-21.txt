Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number: SWL-55652-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
305, 1585 ERNEST
AVENUE LONDON ON N6E2V7


 




Between:


Homestead Land Holdings Limited


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Kyle Armer


Tenant



 
 
Homestead Land Holdings Limited
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kyle Armer (the 'Tenant')
because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Crystal Sankey attended the hearing. As of 3:29 p.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although
properly served with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
02, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent as of December 2021 is $1,050.00.
 
4.     The Tenant has made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,060.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.     Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from June 16, 2021 to
December 1, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1)
of the Act.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 11, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,494.75*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
31, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $34.52
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting February 1, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
11, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 12, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 11, 2022, then starting
February 12, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 12, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$6,701.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$7,751.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 11, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 12, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period
of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
