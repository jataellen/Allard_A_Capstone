Buchi Tabele Sarah Tabele


Tenants



 
 
Brian Maki (the 'Landlord')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Buchi Tabele and Sarah
Tabele (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants
did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on February 3, 2022. The Landlord and the
Tenant, Sarah Tabele, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to August 31,
2021. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 31, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants vacated
the rental unit on August 31, 2021.
The Tenants were in possession of the rental unit on the date
the application was filed.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,400.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,400.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from September 27, 2019 to July 31, 2021.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy is terminated as of August 31, 2021, the date the Tenants gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.




File Number: NOL-43495-21
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,394.87*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to August 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
4.     If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest.
This will be simple interest
calculated from April 1, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
