2518819 Ontario
Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Brenda Trottier (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the
residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment
or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.
 
This application was heard by way of video conference on December 15, 2021. Only the
Landlord’s Agent Monomohan Shira attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s application is based on an N5 notice
served to the Tenant on November
11, 2020 with a termination date of December 4, 2020.
 
2.    
For the reasons set out below, the Landlord’s application is dismissed.
 
Landlord’s uncontested evidence:
 
3.    
The N5 notice refers
to specific incidents
on October 24, 2020, October
25, 2020 and November 10, 2020.
 
4.    
The Landlord
testified that on October 24, 2020 at approximately 3:30am he received
a text message from another resident in the residential complex that the
Tenant was repeatedly calling her rental unit on the buzzer intercom
located at the front entrance
of the residential complex.
 
5.    
On October 25, 2020 at
approximately 7:30pm the Tenant was involved in a physical altercation with another resident
inside the residential complex. Police were contacted,
but it was unclear if charges were laid against the Tenant.
 
6.    
On November
10, 2020 at approximately 11:15am
the Landlord received
a text message from another resident that the Tenant had willfully
blocked the other resident from




 
entering the
front entrance doors of the residential complex. A physical altercation occurred, and the Police
were contacted. It was unclear
if charges were laid against
the Tenant.
 
7.    
The Landlord
was unaware of any incidents involving the similar
conduct plead on the N5 from November 12, 2020 to November 18,
2020.
 
8.    
The N5 notice was served pursuant
to section 64 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
(the Act) which states:
 
64 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy
if the conduct of the tenant,
another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential
complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the
reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the
landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.
 
(2)  
A notice
of termination under subsection (1) shall,
 
(a)    
provide a termination date not earlier
than the 20th day after
the notice is given;
(b)     set out the grounds for termination; and
(c)    
require the tenant, within
seven days, to stop the conduct or activity or correct
the omission set out in the notice
 
(3)   The notice of termination under subsection (1) is void if the tenant, within
seven days after receiving the notice, stops the conduct or activity or
corrects the omission.
 
9.    
It is
clear in the wording of section 64(3) that when a Landlord serves a Tenant an
N5 notice alleging substantial interference that the Tenant has seven says to
correct the activity or conduct
that gave rise to the notice. In this case, the seven-day
voiding period was from
November 12 - November 18, 2020. In order to void the N5, the Tenant was
required to cease or refrain from getting involved in physical altercations,
obstructing or disturbing other residents within the residential complex.
 
10. 
As
this is a Landlord’s application, the burden of proof rests with the Landlord
to prove that the Tenant repeated the alleged conduct during the seven-day
voiding period pursuant to the N5 notice. As the
Landlord had no evidence of further
incidents similar to those set out in the N5 notice
during the period November 12 – November
18, 2020, I find that the Tenant voided the N5.
Therefore, the Landlord was not entitled to file the L2 application with the
Board. The Landlord’s application
must be dismissed for this reason.




 
 
 
 
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
 
1.    The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
