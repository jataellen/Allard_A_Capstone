File Number: SOL-25365-21
 
 
In the matter of:      2144 EIGHTH LINE
OAKVILLE ON L6H4W4
 
Between:                  Veena Malhotra                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 




David Price Shanta Persaud Sunita Persaud


Tenants




 
 
 
Veena Malhotra (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Shanta Persaud, Sunita Persaud and David Price
(the 'Tenants') because
they have been persistently
late in paying their rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day
the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord and the Tenants attended
the hearing. The Landlord’s Representative, Micah Remedios and the Tenants’ Representative, Dan McIntyre
were also present.
 
The parties jointly requested
an adjournment so that this application could
be heard with another application scheduled on
February 1, 2022. The applications are based on different issues and the
request was denied.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The Landlord served a Notice of Termination under section 58(1)
of the Residential Tenancies Act:
 
A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following grounds: (1) The tenant has persistently
failed to pay rent on the date it becomes due and payable.
 
2.       
According to the lease, rent is due on the 15th of every month.
 
3.       
The Notice to Terminate (N8)
stated that the Tenants paid their rent on Feb. 17, March 16, May 17, June 16, July 17, Aug. 17 and Sept.
19, 2021. Aside
from one rent period in
September 2021, the rent was paid either one or two days late




File Number: SOL-25365-21
 
each month which in our view is considered to have reasonably been paid on time.
 
4.       
The payments delayed by one or two
days is very minor. Although technically late, this form of strict
interpretation of the statute was not the intention of its authors. Termination
of the tenancy nor a conditional order is reasonable. The Landlord provided
insufficient evidence to support a finding that the minor delay
caused damage.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
