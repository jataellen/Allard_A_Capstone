Landlords




 
 
and
 
Anna Oppedisano                                                                                                                  Tenant
 
 
 
Dennis Letang and Stephanie
Letang (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Anna Oppedisano (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the
rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 13, 2022. Only
the Landlord, Stephanie Letang attended the hearing. As of 10:08 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing
by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was
required to pay for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 18, 2021.
 
2.      The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     
The lawful monthly rent is $900.00.
 
4.     
The Landlord is not holding a last month's
rent deposit.
 
5.     
The Tenant paid $2,450.00
after the application was filed.
 
6.      I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19
on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment
agreement with the Tenant and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the
eviction until February 20, 2022 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b)
of the Act. I am not satisfied that the Landlords attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant.

31, 2022, or
ii)             
$6,751.00 if the payment

Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount

vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
