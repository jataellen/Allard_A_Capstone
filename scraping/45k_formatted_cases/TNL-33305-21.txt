Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-33305-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


MAIN FLOOR, 192
SILVERBIRCH DRIVE NEWMARKET
  ON L3Y2Z5


 




Between:


Ahmad Hassanzadeh Esfahani


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Chealsiea Nichole Pynn Thomas Johnaton Taylor


Tenants



 
 
 
Ahmad Hassanzadeh Esfahani (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Chealsiea Nichole Pynn and Thomas Johnaton
Taylor (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard via videoconference on December 7, 2021. The Landlord, the landlord’s
legal representative, and the Tenant, C. N. Pynn (CP), attended the hearing. CP
stated that she was appearing on behalf of T. J. Taylor (TT). TT was not
present although properly served with notice
of this hearing.
CP had an opportunity to speak to Tenant Duty Counsel before
the hearing.
 
Preliminary Issue:
 
1.   
At the hearing, the
Tenant wanted to raise section 82 issues for me to consider offsetting against
her arrears. The Tenant had served on the Landlord and filed with the Board a
substantial number of documents. The Tenant submitted that she had served a list of section
82 issues on the Landlord
and filed it with the Board via email. The Board does not have any
record of a list of section 82 issues.
 
2.   
The Landlord objected
to the Tenant raising section 82 issues. First, the Tenants were required, as
per the Interim Order of Member Di
Salle, issued October 25, 2021, to pay the rent in full and on time from commencing November 1, 2021
until the application is heard, failing which, the Board may refuse to consider the Tenants’ evidence
and submissions. The Tenants did not pay the rent in full
and on time from November 1, 2021 to the date of the hearing. Secondly, the
Landlord had not received any list of section 82 issues.
 
3.   
The Tenant replied that
she did not receive the Interim Order and did not trust the Interim Order
forwarded to her by the Landlord because of false information received from him
in the past. When asked if an oral direction was given by Member Di Salle regarding
paying the rent in full and on time, to which she replied
he did, but she could not pay as she had to
pay for other things.




 
 
 
4.   
Pursuant to section 82 of the Act, a Tenant is permitted to raise any issue
that could be the subject of an application if the Tenant
complies with disclosure requirements or provides
an explanation satisfactory to the Board explaining why the Tenant could
not comply. Section 82(2) requires a tenant to give advance notice to the
landlord of the tenant’s intent to raise the
issue at the hearing and this notice
shall be in writing. While
the Tenant submits
that she served a list of
section 82 issues on the Landlord and filed with the Board via email, I find this unlikely
as both the Landlord and the Board had not received this document. The Board’s
records, however, show that a number of the Tenant’s other documents
were received via email. Further, I find that the Tenant was aware of her
obligation to pay the rent in full and on time, failing which, the Board may
refuse to consider her evidence, but she chose to allocate funds elsewhere.
 
5.   
I find it to be unfair to the Landlord to proceed on the Tenant’s issues
as the Landlord would not
know how to reasonably respond to any of the Tenant’s allegations. As such, I
did not hear the Tenant’s
evidence regarding the maintenance issues.
However, it should
be noted that this does not
preclude the Tenants from bringing
their own application regarding these maintenance issues. They may wish to
contact their local legal clinic to get advice in this regard.
 
 
Determinations:
 
6.   
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from May 1,
2020 to December 31, 2021. Because of
the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 5,
2021.
 
7.   
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
8.   
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,900.00.
 
9.   
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,900.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord. Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period from April 12, 2020 to July 5,
2021.
 
10.
The Tenants
have made no payments since
the application was filed.
 
11. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of
COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
12. Section 83(6) of the Act provides that,
where a tenant’s arrears arose in whole or in part after March 17, 2020, the
Board must consider “whether the landlord has attempted to negotiate an agreement with the tenant
including terms of payment for the tenant’s
arrears.” The Landlord submitted that there was an attempt
to negotiate a repayment plan in January




 
2021 through email. However, the Tenants raised maintenance issues,
and payment plan discussions ceased. The Tenant submitted
that there were never any discussions regarding a payment plan. She submitted that she advised
the Landlord that she lost her job because of COVID-19, and he advised her to collect CERB and EI so
they could pay rent. In cross, the Tenant repeatedly confirmed that had a payment plan been presented to her, she would
have negotiated with the Landlord.
 
13. I am not satisfied that the Landlord
negotiated a repayment plan with the Tenants. As the applicant, the Landlord bears the burden of proving
the merits of their claim
on a balance of
probabilities (i.e., at least 51% of
the way). Based on the Tenant’s testimony, I find that the Landlord had not
adduced enough evidence to refute the Tenant’s believable and credible
evidence. As such, I find the Landlord did not attempt to negotiate a repayment
plan with the Tenants.
 
14. Regarding
section 83(2) of the Act, the Tenant
submitted that she has two kids residing
with her, aged 2 and 7. The reason they could not pay rent on time was
because she had lost her job to COVID-19 in March 2021. She had also been paying for maintenance herself.
She submitted that she is leaving the unit on December 31, 2021, as she
signed a new lease commencing January 1, 2022.
 
15. The Landlord submitted that he has been prejudiced by a long adjournment and the amount of arrears has made it difficult
to afford maintaining the unit.
 
16. While the Landlord not negotiating a
repayment plan with the Tenants is not a positive consideration, I find that it
would be unfair to grant relief from eviction. The Tenants submitted that they have already signed
a lease elsewhere so a postponed termination date
would only prejudice the Landlord. As such, the tenancy is terminated.
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 16, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $13,579.47*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 5, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the
Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $62.47 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 6, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 16, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from January 17, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.




 
6.    
If the unit is not
vacated on or before January 16, 2022, then starting January 17, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the
Landlord, on or after January 17, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 16, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $17,161.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If this payment
is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order
if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
January 17, 2022 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
