Residential Tenancies

File Number: SOL-26737-21
 



In the
  matter of:


51 GRAND STREET BRANTFORD ON N3R4B3


 




Between:


2609991 Ontario Inc Marchman Holdings Inc.


Landlords




 


and


 




 


Larry Lindley Tanya Cunningham


Tenants



 
 
On December
17, 2021, 2609991 Ontario Inc and Marchman Holdings Inc. (the 'Landlords')
applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Tanya Cunningham and Larry Lindley
(the 'Tenants') and for an order
to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in
the order issued by the Board on December 6,
2021 with respect to application SOL-23249-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that the
Landlords could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenants
if the Tenants did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following
condition(s) specified in the order:
 
The Tenants failed
to pay to the Landlords, the rent for the month of December 2021, on or before December 15,
2021.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$6,186.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-23249-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $6,186.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SOL-23249-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have also failed
to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from November 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.




File Number: SOL-26737-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-23249-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 28, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall
pay to the Landlords $9,186.00*. This amount represents the rent owing up to
December 31, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous
application.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlords $49.32
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 1, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
January 28, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from
January 29, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 28, 2022, then starting January
29, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after January 29, 2022.

The tenant has until January 27, 2022 to file a motion with the Board
to set aside the order
under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant
files the motion
by January 27, 2022 the order will be stayed
and the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section
81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction
