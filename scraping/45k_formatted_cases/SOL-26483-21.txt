Residential Tenancies Act, 2006

In the matter
of:


04, 77 TINDALE COURT HAMILTON ON L8K6C9


 




Between:


Interrent C/o CLV
Group


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Danielle
Speed


Tenant



 
On November
12, 2021, Interrent C/o CLV Group (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Danielle Speed (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have
the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a
condition specified in the order issued by the Board on October 12, 2021 with
respect to application SOL-22933-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice
to the Tenant to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.    
I find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord
$2,298.47 on or before November
1, 2021 towards rent.
 
3.    
The previous
application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord
is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenant
was ordered to pay $13,083.29 for rent arrears
and the costs
related to the Landlord's application fee in Order
SOL-22933-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $12,583.29 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SOL-22933-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $2,298.47 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to January 6, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26483-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order SOL-22933-21 is cancelled.
 
2.    
The tenancy
between the Landlord
and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 17, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall pay to the Landlord
$12,580.99*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to November 30, 2021 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $75.57
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting December 1, 2021 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the
Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January
17, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 18, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 17, 2022, then starting January
18, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 18, 2022.
