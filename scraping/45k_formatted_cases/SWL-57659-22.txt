Tenants



 
 
Joanne Habl and Michael
Habl (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Janet Johnston and Laurie
Johnston (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants signed an agreement to
terminate the tenancy as of December 31, 2021 and the Tenants did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination
date set out in the agreement.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 21, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlords $201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlords the full amount owing on or before
February 21, 2022, they will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 22, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 21, 2022, then starting February
22, 2022, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 22, 2022.
