Order under Section 77
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-57645-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


190 BEDFORD CRESCENT SARNIA ON N7S4B5


 




Between:


Robert Jefferies
  Judith Jefferies


Landlords




 


 
and


 




 


Laura Stevenson Roxanne Stevenson


Tenants



 
 
 
Robert Jefferies and Judith
Jefferies (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Laura
Stevenson and Roxanne
Stevenson (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants entered into an agreement to
terminate the tenancy.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlords and the Tenants
signed an agreement to terminate the tenancy as of
March 31, 2022.
 
2.     Since the application was filed on a no-fault
basis, before the termination date, it is not
appropriate to require the Tenant to pay the application filing fee as costs.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before March 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 31, 2022, then starting
April 1, 2022, the
Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2022.
