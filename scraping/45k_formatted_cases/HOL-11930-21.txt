Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-11930-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


221, 400 LYLE STREET
  LONDON ON N5W0B9


 




Between:


Medallion Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Dany Hoi
Victoria
Jade May Lee


Tenants



 
 
 
Medallion Corporation (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Dany Hoi and Victoria Jade May Lee (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 16, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Rawan Hussein, attended the hearing. As of 2:02 p.m., the Tenants were not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not
paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July
1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective September
1, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
are in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.    
The lawful
monthly rent is $1,045.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants
paid $3,100.00 after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
sent a letter to the Tenants on the necessity of a repayment agreement. The
Landlord’s attempts at negotiating a repayment agreement were unsuccessful.
 
6.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,045.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
7.    
I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including
the impact of COVID-19 on the




 
parties and whether the
Landlord attempted to negotiate a
repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would not be unfair to postpone
the eviction until January 31, 2022
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the
Act. Additional time given to
the Tenants to pay the outstanding amount.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids
the order as set out below, the tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental
unit on or before January 31, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay
to the Landlord $1,318.08*, which represents the amount of rent owing and
compensation up to January 6, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $34.36 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 7, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not
pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 31, 2022, the
Tenants will start to owe interest. This
will be simple interest calculated from February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on
the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
February 1, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before
January 31, 2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $3,376.00** to the Landlord or
to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenants
could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.    
The Tenants may make a
motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after
February 1, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy
agreement with the Landlord.
