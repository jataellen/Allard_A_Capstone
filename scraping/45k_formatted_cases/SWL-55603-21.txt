Cacoeli Living Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Titus Mbayoh (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 20, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, Lisa Nadon,
attended the hearing. As of 2:06 p.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required
to pay for the period from November 1, 2020 to October
31, 2021. Because of the
arrears, the Landlord served
a Notice of Termination effective January 31, 2021.
 
2.     
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 31, 2021. The Tenant
was in possession of the
rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.      The lawful monthly
rent was $1,354.15.
 
4.     
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,325.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
5.     
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2021.
 
6.      The Tenant paid $2,053.29 after the application was filed.




File Number: SWL-55603-21
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     
The Tenancy is terminated as of October 31, 2021, the date the Tenant gave vacant
possession of the rental unit to the Landlord.
 
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $82.89*,
which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to October 31, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.

If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full
amount owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest

outstanding.
