Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 











 
 

HV and OL or collectively, the 'Landlords' applied for
an order to terminate the tenancy and evict HC or the Tenant because the Tenant
did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. (L1 Application)
 
The Landlords also applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Landlords intend to convert the
rental unit to a non-residential use. The Landlords also claimed compensation
for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date. (L2
Application)
 
These applications were heard in Mississauga on
February 8, 2018.   Only one of the Landlords, HV, attended
the hearing.   HV testified that she spoke with HC on February 7th
and HC explained that he was currently out of the country, and will return once
he settles some passport/visa issue.  HV said that HC told her he intends to
pay the outstanding rent and accepts the Landlords’ request that he is to move
out by March 31, 2018.
 
Determinations:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
The Tenant has not paid the
total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from January 1, 2018
to February 28, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of
Termination effective January 16, 2018.
2.     
The Landlords collected a
rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by
the Landlords.
3.     
Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period from July 18, 2014 to January 16, 2018.
L2 Application
4.     
HV testified that the rental
unit is one of three units in the building that has been operating as a three
unit building under her ownership for about 20 years.
5.     
HV testified that around
September 20, 2017, one of the tenants had need of ambulatory assistance to go
to hospital.  Shortly thereafter, she was called by Andrew Wemekamp, a zoning
by-laws officer of the City of Brampton, who scheduled an appointment with her for
the City to inspect the building.  HV said she was informed that the ambulance
service was the entity that contacted the City.  In any event, an inspection
was conducted and HV testified she was notified by the City that the 3-unit
house was not at all legal and she was ordered to promptly return to the
building into a single dwelling building.
6.     
HV testified she promptly
took action and after engaging the proper professionals to assist her with the
conversion plans, she secured a City of Brampton Building Permit (no. 18 101550
000 00 HM, dated January 23, 2018) – reference: exhibit LL#1.  HV also
submitted a full set of “scope of work” drawings for the building which have
been vetted and approved by the City – reference:  exhibit LL#2.  HV described
the extent of conversion work to be undertaken.
7.     
Based on LL#2 and HV’s
testimony, I am satisfied that the approved scope of work to convert the house
into a single dwelling is extensive and will require the rental unit to be
vacated.  I am also satisfied that the Landlords have obtained the necessary
permits for this work
8.     
HV reiterated that she has
kept HC sufficiently informed of these developments and that HC has indicated
his intention to cooperate.
9.     
HV testified that she is not
certain what she will do with the building once it is converted, but informed
that she is considering all options including the sale of the building.  
10.  
I considered the N13 notice
to end the tenancy that was served on the Tenant by the Landlords.   There is
no Landlord and Tenant Board notice currently in existence that matches the
exact situation at bar.  
11.  
That is, a form N12 notice
can only be used when a landlord needs to evict a tenant so the landlord (or
their family, or a caregiver) or a purchaser (or their family, or a caregiver) can
move into the unit.  This is clearly not the case here.
12.  
A form N13 notice provides a
landlord three possible options to evict a tenant: the first being a need to
demolish the rental unit; the second being a need to undertake extensive
renovations to the rental unit that requires the tenant to move out until the
work is completed so the tenant can move back in (under a legislated right of
first refusal); and the third being a need to convert the rental unit into a
non-residential unit.
13.  
In this case, the Landlords’
situation falls squarely in between the second and third options of the form
N13 notice.  It is evident that the Tenant must move out of the rental unit (of
this application) while the extensive conversion work is undertaken, but once
the conversion is done, there will no rental unit for the Tenant to conceivably
move back into.  That means the Tenant will not have any right of first refusal
to exercise.  It is also evident that the work to be undertaken is that of
conversion, and not simply renovation.
14.  
As such, I am of the view
the N13 notice that was served by the Landlords on the Tenant in this case to
be in effect, correct and valid.  I provided my oral determination that I find
in favour of the Landlords’ application and am granting the requested
termination.  I asked HV for any Tenant or other circumstances that she may be
aware of.
            Section
83
15.  
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances for both L1 and L2 applications in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
L1 Application
 
1.     
Unless the Tenant voids the
order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is
terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 4,
2018.
2.     
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $512.75*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation
up to February 21, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe
on the rent deposit.
3.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $25.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting
February 22, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.     
The Tenant shall also pay to
the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
5.     
If the Tenant does not pay
the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before March 4, 2018, the Tenant
will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from March
5, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.     
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 4, 2018, then starting March 5, 2018, the Landlords may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
7.     
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords, on or after March 5, 2018.
8.     
If the Tenant wishes to void
this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay to the Landlords or to
the Board in trust:
i)        $1,720.00 if the payment is made on or before February 28, 2018, or
ii)       $2,485.00 if the payment is made on or before March 4, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.     
The Tenant may make a motion
to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they
pay the amount required under that subsection on or after March 5, 2018 but
before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlords.
 
 
L2 Application
10.  
Even if the Tenant voids the
L1 application portion of the order above, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated in a final way (non-remedial), as of March 31,
2018.  
11.  
The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before March 31, 2018.
12.  
If the Tenant does not move
out of the unit on or before March 31, 2018 the Tenant shall pay to the
Landlords $25.15 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from April 1,
2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
13.  
If the unit is not vacated
on or before March 31, 2018, then starting April 1, 2018, the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
14.  
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlords on or after April 1, 2018.
