Equiton Residential Income Fund LP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Christopher Murphy (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on December 21, 2021. Only the Landlord's Legal Representative, Robert Forster
attended the hearing.
As of 2:34 p.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing
although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant has not paid
the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective August
24, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenant vacated the rental unit on
October 18, 2021. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent was $1,595.00.
 
4.    
The Tenant made no payments after the application was filed.
 
5.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,595.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent
deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2021 to August
24, 2021.
