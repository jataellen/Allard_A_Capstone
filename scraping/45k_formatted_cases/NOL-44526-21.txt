Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-44526-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


719 PACIFIC AVENUE THUNDER BAY ON P7C2S4


 




Between:


Native People
of Thunder Bay Dev. Corp.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Georgette Gionet


Tenant



 
 
 
Native People
of Thunder Bay Dev. Corp. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict Georgette Gionet (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant has
been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022.
 
The Landlord’s
Agent, Cindy Pareigis, attended the hearing.
As of 4:00 p.m., the Tenant was not present nor represented although
properly served with a Notice of Hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.   
By way of background, this is a month-to-month tenancy
in which rent is
due on the first of every
month.
 
2.    The Landlord alleges the Tenant has persistently
failed to pay the rent on the date it was due for the period between January
2020 and September 2021. This resulted in the Landlord serving the Tenant a N8
Notice of Termination (‘the Notice’) on November 19, 2021.
 
3.    Since serving the Notice, the Tenant has continued to
pay the rent late however the rent has recently been paid to the period ending
February 28, 2022. While the
Landlords seeks to termination of the tenancy, they would not be opposed to a
conditional order in the alternative.

4.    Based on the evidence before the Board, I am satisfied
that the Tenant has persistently paid her rent late from January 2020 to
September 2021.
 
5.    I have
considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from
eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to
subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act.
 
6.   
A
conditional order shall
issue permitting the tenancy to continue so long as the Tenant continues to pay the rent in full
and on time for the next 12 months.
 
7.   
This order contains all of the reasons for my decision within it. No further reasons shall be
issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord
new rent on time and in full for the period of March 2022 to February 2023.
 
2.    If the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in
accordance with paragraph 1 of this order the Landlord may, without notice to
the Tenant and within 30 days of the breach, apply to the Board pursuant to
section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant.
 
3.   
The Tenant shall also pay to the
Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application on or before March 31,
2022.
 
4.    If the Tenant fails
to comply with paragraph
3 of this order,
the Tenant will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually
on the balance outstanding.
