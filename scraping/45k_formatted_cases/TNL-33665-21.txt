tamm
Simion And Larisa Volpov
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate
the tenancy and evict
Suzana Maganja (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the
rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
This
application was heard in Passcode: 936 8115 8630# on
October 21, 2021. The Landlord,
represented by Tammer Grinberg, and the Tenant,
represented by Michelle
Mont, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     It is the Tenant’s position that the N12 notice to
terminate the tenancy was served in bad faith.
In September 2020 the Landlord’ daughter Tammer Grinberg, who looks
after her parents’ affairs for the rental unit, asked the Tenant to pay $100.00
per month more in rent. The Tenant paid the increase in September but then informed
Ms. Grinberg that the
rent increase was not lawful under the Residential Tenancies Act and she
would not pay it anymore. The increase was approximately 5% or $50.00 more than
the guideline permits.
 
2.    
In December 2020 there is a text message
from the Tenant to Ms. Grinberg informing
her that an application has been filed with the Board.
 
3.     The Landlord’s representative submits it was twelve days after the text message
the N12 notice was served. That notice was defective because of the
termination date on the notice. The Landlords
withdrew the application. After the application was withdrawn, the Landlords served another N12 notice
with led to this application.
 
4.     Ms. Fisher testified
that she was not aware of the application at the time and the notice
had nothing to do with the Tenant’s application. Her parents are elderly and have decided to move into the unit.




 
5.    
The Landlord Larisa Volpov
appeared at the hearing and confirmed they want to move into the rental unit. The Landlords own the condominium that is
the rental unit. They are 79 and 84
years of age. They currently live in
a two-storey home and can no longer manage the stairs
and need to be in the condominium for easier access
and mobility. Mr. Volpov has serious health issues and
is increasingly limited in his ability to get around.
 
6.     On a balance of probabilities, I find that the
Landlords did not serve the notice in bad faith. The lawful monthly
rent is $1,915.00. The rent increase
would have amounted
to approximately $50.00 per month over the guideline. It does not seem reasonable, with no other evidence that the Landlord’s had another reason to terminate
the tenancy, that this issue would lead to the serving
of an N12 notice.
 
7.    
Based on the testimony from Mrs
Volpov, their person circumstances, and the fact the rent could have increase
in 90 days after the Tenant informed Ms. Grinberg that the increase was lawful,
the Landlords served another N12 than serve notice for a lawful increase. As such, I find the Landlords in good faith require possession of the rental
unit for the purpose of residential occupation.
 
8.     The Landlords paid the Tenant
compensation equal to one month's
rent.
 
9.     The Tenant was asked at the hearing
about delaying the termination of the tenancy
if the Board determined the
Landlords require the unit in good faith. The
Tenant requested a delay until the end of the school year. Considering the fact the Landlords
currently have a home to live in and the disruption this eviction will cause to
the Tenant, I find a delay until July 31, 2022 is appropriate.
 
10.  In addition, I find it fair that if the Tenant locates
alternative accommodations that require her to vacate the unit earlier, the Tenant may provide the Landlords with 10 written
notice to terminate the tenancy earlier. I believe this is fair as the Landlord’s are seeking a shorter
termination period.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of July 31, 2022. The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 31, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
July 31, 2022, then starting
August 1, 2022, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after August 1, 2022.
 
4.    
The Tenant may terminate
the tenancy earlier
with 10 days written notice
to the Landlord.
