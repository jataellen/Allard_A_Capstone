terminate the tenancy as of December 15, 2021 and the Tenant did not move out of the rental
unit by the termination

is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.

$201.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
January 30, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from January 31, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 30, 2022, then starting January
