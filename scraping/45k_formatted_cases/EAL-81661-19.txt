Order under Section
126
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
 
 
 
FP (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order permitting the rent charged
to be increased by more than the guideline for one or more of the rental
units in the residential complex.
 
This application
was resolved by written hearing. The Board received submissions from the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, S. DL and the Tenants, AM and KF.
 
It is determined that:
 
1.                 
The Landlord
justified a rent increase above
the guideline because
of capital expenditures.
 
2.                 
The maximum
rent increase above the guideline
because of capital
expenditure is 6.61%. This increase is for a capital
expenditure for Window and Balcony Door Replacement.
 
3.                 
The Certificate of Service filed by the Landlord on October 16, 2020, indicates
that some rental units listed
in the application were not served with the application and notice of hearing.
The Board shall therefore amend the application by removing these rental units.
As a
result, this order for a rent increase
above the guideline under section 126 of the Act
does not apply to the following units: 103, 104, 113, 204, 205, 209, 210, 213,
305, 307, 308, 311, 314, 402, 404, 409, 414, 502, 512, 513, 602, 605, 610, 611, 612, 613, 705, 706,
708, 709 and 714.
 
4.                 
The Landlord
submits that the windows and balcony doors required replacement because they were original and had reached the end of their
useful life. They were replaced with new and more energy efficient aluminum
framed windows and balcony doors. The Landlord claims the incurred costs are
eligible under s.126(7)(a)(b) and (e) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the “Act”) because the work was necessary to protect




and restore the
physical integrity of the residential complex, required to comply with housing and maintenance standards, and promotes energy
conservation. The Landlord submits this capital expenditure
work was completed on March 29, 2018.
 
Deficiency Letter issued
by the Board
 
5.                 
The Board
issued a deficiency letter to the Landlord dated
September 28, 2020 noting that some of the capital expenditure invoices and payment
dates fall outside
of the 18- month capital expenditure period.
 
6.                 
As the first effective date (‘FED’) of the proposed rent increase is July 1, 2019. The 18- month period for completion of the work is between
October 3, 2017 and April
3, 2019.
 
7.                 
In the application the
Landlord claims amounts for contractor invoices from L-ICI and WSBCI that pre-date the 18-month
period. The invoice amounts and dates are as follows:
 
i.            
$23,807.91 dated
August 31, 2017.
Payment issued November
7, 2017.
 
ii.           
$213,661.08 dated
September 30, 2017.
Payment issued November
7, 2017.
 
iii.            
$13,560.00 dated March
21, 2017. Payment issued August 1, 2017.
 
iv.            
$15,763.50 dated June 15, 2017. Payment
issued August 11, 2017.
 
v.           
$9,040.00 dated July 28, 2017. Payment
issued September 1, 2017.
 
vi.            
$13,560.00 dated September 20, 2017. Payment
issued October 5, 2017.
 
Landlord’s reply to deficiency letter
 
8.                 
The Landlord’s reply to the deficiency letter
was received by the Board on October
6, 2020.
 
9.                 
The Landlord
submits the claimed
work for the window and balcony door replacement is one project.
 
10.             
The Landlord relies on
s. 26(2) of Ontario Regulation 516/06 (“O. Reg. 516/06”) which
stipulates a rent increase shall not be ordered in respect of a capital
expenditure unless the work
was completed during
the 18-month period
ending 90 days before the effective date of the first intended rent increase referred to in the
application.
 
11.             
The Landlord
also relies on Interpretation Guideline
14 which says: "Incurred" means that full payment of the capital
expenditure, other than any hold back that is required under the Construction
Lien Act, must have been made by the time the application is




filed.
 
12.             
The Landlord submits
that most of the construction work took place between August 2017 and January 2018 and all work was completed on December 17, 2018; and the last payment was made on January 11, 2019.
 
13.             
As the application was
filed on March 27, 2019, it is the Landlord’s position that the work was not only completed within
the 18-month period
but fully paid for by the time the application was filed.
 
Analysis
 
14.             
I find the evidence
produced by the Landlord supports the conclusion that the work related to the claimed
capital expenditure was completed in the 18-month period that ends 90 days
before the FED of July 1, 2019. I also accept that the claimed costs were
incurred and paid prior to the application being filed which aligns with the requirements set out in Interpretation
Guideline 14. I find the Landlord
has complied with s. 26(2) of O. Reg. 516/06.
 
15.             
Therefore, the Landlord is entitled to include in the expenditure, the contractor invoices dated August 31, 2017, September
30, 2017, March 21, 2017, June 15, 2017, July 28, 2017, and September 20, 2017.
 
Non-maintenance issues raised
by the Tenants
 
Issue #1 - Above guideline
increase does not apply as tenancy commenced
after completion date of work
 
Tenant’s submission
 
16.             
The Tenant,
AM, submits he moved into the residential complex on November 29, 2018 which is after the date
of completion of the work for the claimed capital expenditure. Adam Mansell
relies on s.126(9) of the Act which stipulates an above guideline increase for
a capital expenditure does not apply to any tenants who entered into a tenancy
agreement following the completion of the work for the claimed capital expenditure.
 
Landlord’s reply
 
17.             
The Landlord concedes
that AM moved into the rental unit after the completion dated of March
29, 2018 as noted on the application. The Landlord submits that this tenancy will not be
affected by the above guideline increase under this application.




Analysis
 
18.             
Pursuant to s.126(9) of
the Act, AM will not be affected by the above guideline increase under this application because
he moved into the rental
unit after March 29, 2018.
 
Issue #2 – Unable to review supporting documents
 
Tenant’s submission
 
19.             
The Tenant,
KF submits that the Landlord ignored
the request made to view the supporting documents and as
such, this Tenant was unable to review them.
 
Landlord’s reply
 
20.             
The Landlord
submits the supporting documents have been available for viewing by the
Tenants at the Landlord’s office a few minutes away from the residential
complex and any Tenant who requested to view the documents was given access.
 
21.             
The Landlord submits
the Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) package was served on the Tenants affected by
this application on October 8, 2020 and it included the Supporting Documents for Tenants to View document. At the time the NOH package was served on the Tenants, the Landlord’s office was
closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, included in the documentation was
information advising the Tenants that they could obtain a copy of the
supporting documentation by appointment through the Landlord’s office and that
this could be scheduled by telephone or email. The Landlord further submits
that information was also included in the NOH package that a Tenant could
obtain a copy of the supporting documents by requesting it by telephone through
DLD&LL LLP and a phone number was provided.
 
22.             
The Landlord
submits that neither
of DLD&LL LLP nor the Landlord received a request from KF to
review the supporting documentation.
 
Analysis
 
23.             
I accept
the Landlord’s submission that the NOH package as confirmed by the Certificate of Service (“COS”) was served
on the Tenants, including KF on October 8, 2020. I accept the Landlord’s
submission that information was included with the NOH package advising the
Tenants how they could obtain and view a copy of the supporting documentation
and that no request to view this documentation was received from KF. This is
because KF ailed to provide any details to support when and how these requests
to view the supporting documents were made, including whether the requests
were made by telephone, or email, and any dates
the requests were made. As
such, I am not persuaded that any requests made by KF to view the supporting
documents were ignored by the Landlord.




Issue #3 – New windows
less efficient
 
Tenant submissions
 
24.             
The Tenant,
KF submits the new windows are less efficient because there has been an increase in heat usage during
the winter months and increased air conditioning (“A/C”) usage during the
summer months.
 
25.             
KF further submits that
the space above the balcony doors was removed following the window installation and the new windows are too small
to house a standard
air conditioning unit. As a result, KF submits this required purchasing a
portable air conditioning unit.
 
Landlord’s reply
 
26.             
The Landlord
submits that no complaints were received from KF
regarding the window replacement, other than in this Tenant’s submissions for
this hearing. The Landlord further submits
that there were no issues with the balcony doors
and windows seen or reported
on during any of the annual maintenance inspections, the most recent one being
September 30, 2021.
 
27.             
The Landlord
submits the window
design for the windows installed
in 2017/2018 did not
provide for standard window A/C units. Further, the design of the new balcony
doors differed from the previous design which had removable panels which could
be used to hold air conditioning units. The design of the new living
room windows only allowed for portable A/C venting only. The Landlord
submits this was to limit the damage caused
by residents improperly installing window shakers and damaging window tracks
which caused condensation leaks to the units below. The Landlord
lastly submits that regardless
of whether the Tenants were able to install window
A/C units in their windows
following their replacement, that is not relevant to this application.
 
Analysis
 
28.             
I am not persuaded that
the new windows are less efficient. This is because KF has not provided any
supporting evidence that more heat is utilized during the winter months
and more electricity during the summer
months when the A/C in the rental unit is used. There was no
information produced by this Tenant regarding how much electricity was
previously used prior to the windows being replaced when the window A/C unit
was utilized.
 
29.             
Further, I do not find the inability to install window
A/C units following the replacement of
the windows to be a serious maintenance breach of s. 20 of the Act as required
by s. 126(12). As such, it cannot be considered as part of this application.




Maintenance issue raised by one of the Tenants
 
Issue #4 – Faceplate for cable outlet
not installed on wall
 
Tenant’s submission
 
30.             
KF submits that following the window replacement, the faceplate for the
cable outlet was never installed and was left loose and dangling off the wall.
 
Landlord’s reply
 
31.             
The Landlord submits it
was unaware that the cable faceplate was left dangling off the wall in this Tenant’s
unit following the replacement of the windows
as the first time this Tenant has addressed this is in the
written submissions for this hearing.
 
32.             
The Landlord
produced a copy of a workorder dated
October 21, 2019 for this Tenant’s
unit which notes “please drop off cover plate for cable unit. Tenant says he
can install
it”.1 The Landlord submits
the cover plate for the
cable outlet was dropped off at the
Tenant’s unit that same day and the Landlord
heard nothing further
from this Tenant
with regards to this.
 
Analysis
 
33.             
I accept the Landlord’s
evidence that it does not have any outstanding workorders which address this
issue. The work order produced by the Landlord dated October 21, 2019 notes the Tenant would
be installing the faceplate
and I accept that the Landlord
received no further requests
regarding this issue. KF
has not produced any evidence
to support when the requests were made to the Landlord regarding this
issue. Further, I do not find the cable plate not being affixed to the wall
rises to the level of a serious maintenance breach and therefore cannot be
considered as part of this application.
 
Conclusion
 
34.             
I find the claimed
capital expenditure is an eligible
capital expenditure that satisfies the requirements of s.126(7)(a)(b) and (e)
of Act. I find the Landlord is entitled to the claimed amounts for the entirety
of the work claimed in the application.

useful life for the capital
expenditure is as specified on Schedule 3.
 
36.
