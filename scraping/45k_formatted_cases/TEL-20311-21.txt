Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 



 


File Number:
TEL-20311-21




In the
matter of:


UNIT 2, 158 WALTON STREET PORT HOPE ON L1A1N6


 




Between:


Darren Van De Walker


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Carri Lee-Agnes Clark


Tenant



 
 
On October 21, 2021, Darren Van De Walker
(the 'Landlord') applied in this
L4 application for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict Carri Lee-Agnes Clark (the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant
pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed to meet a condition
specified in the consent order issued by the Board on
July 28, 2021 with respect
to L1 application TEL-15729-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The consent order provided that
the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I
find that the Tenant has not met the following
condition specified in the order:
 
The Tenant failed to pay to the Landlord $200.00
on or before October 1, 2021 towards arrears of rent. This was a breach of paragraph 3(a) of the consent order. This L4 application was filed
within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
In paragraph 2 of the consent order,
the Tenant agreed to pay $3,905.52 for rent
arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in L1
application TEL-15729-21. The amount that
is still owing from that order is $3,550.00 and that amount
is included in this order. As a result, the previous
consent order TEL-15729-21 is cancelled.
 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has also failed
to pay the full rent that
became owing for the period from October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021.




 
6.       
On November 1, 2018 the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $865.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from the
date of collection, November 1, 2018
to the date of this order, January 4, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order
TEL-15729-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before January
15, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the
calculations below.
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $2,761.66*. This amount represents the rent owing up to October 31, 2021 and the costs
related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay
to the Landlord $29.59 per day
for compensation for the use of the unit starting
November 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenant actually
moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
15, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 16, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 15, 2022, then starting January
16, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 16, 2022.
 
 
 
January 4, 2022
