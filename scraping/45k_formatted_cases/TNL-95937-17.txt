Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-95937-17
TNT-98761-17
 










 
 

S.I
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict R.B
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. 
The Tenant applied for an order determining that the Landlord did not meet its
maintenance obligations.
 
The
applications were heard together in Toronto on December 15, 2017 and March 2,
2018.
 
The Landlord’s representative D.R and the Tenant attended the
hearing.
Reasons
Overview
1.   
These applications arose from a complaint the Tenant has about
cockroaches.  In July, 2017, the Tenant withheld a month’s rent because she
felt that the Landlord had not addressed her complaints.  The Landlord then
applied to terminate the tenancy for rent arrears.  The Tenant counter-claimed
seeking compensation regarding her complaints.
2.   
For the reasons that follow, the Tenant has not established that the
Landlord breached its obligations.  Her application will be dismissed.
3.   
Over the course of these proceedings, the Tenant paid her rent into the
Board.  Some of that money has already been paid out to the Landlord.  Now that
the matter has concluded, the remaining $5,626.80 held by the Board will be
paid out to the Landlord.  This leaves arrears owing of $1,300.39, essentially
one month’s rent and the Landlord’s filing fee.
4.   
The Tenant does not seek relief under section 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘RTA’), as she is able to pay the full amount
owing.  Accordingly, a standard order will issue providing that the tenancy
will terminate unless the Tenant pays her arrears within eleven days.
The Tenant’s application
History
5.   
The Tenant’s main complaint concerns a cockroach infestation.  She first
told the Landlord about the problem in February, 2016.  In response to her
complaints, the Landlord carried out pest control treatments in February, May,
and August 2016.  
6.   
The cockroach infestation persisted, but the Tenant did not tell the
Landlord that the August treatment had not resolved the problem.  She gave
several reasons for this: she said that she was too busy with other issues in
her life; that she was suffering from depression; and that she did not want any
more pest control because she felt it was making the problem worse.  Whatever
the reasons, the Tenant did not complain to the Landlord again for seven months.
7.   
The Tenant next mentioned the cockroaches to the Landlord in March,
2017.  The Landlord says that in response, it scheduled a pest control
treatment in April but the Tenant refused the treatment.  The Tenant does not
recall this, but I find the Landlord’s evidence to be credible on this point. 
Its records clearly show that the Tenant refused a treatment, and that is
consistent with the Tenant’s subsequent conduct and with her belief that the
treatments were making the problem worse.
8.   
In July, 2017, the Tenant started withholding her rent.  At some point,
the Landlord asked her about it, and she told it she was frustrated about the
ongoing cockroach problem.  The Landlord responded by scheduling a pest control
treatment in September, 2017, but the Tenant refused to permit the treatment
because she did not think it would work.
9.   
On November 16, 2017, the Tenant paid for her own pest control
treatment.  She says that the treatment seems to have been effective.  On
November 24, she refused another treatment scheduled by the Landlord, on the
basis that she was treating the problem herself.
Analysis
10. Pursuant
to subsection 29(2) of the RTA, I can only consider conduct that occurred within
one year before the Tenant made her application.  The Tenant first raised her
issues as a counter-claim under section 82 of the RTA on September 12, 2017, so
I can consider whether the Landlord met its obligations from September 12, 2016
onwards.
11. On
the evidence before me, the Landlord had no way of knowing, on September 12,
2016, that there was a cockroach problem in the unit.  The Landlord had done
pest control treatments in February, May, and August.  The Tenant had not
informed it that the treatments had not solved the problem.
12. The
Landlord first learned that more treatments were needed in March, 2017.  Since
that time, it scheduled three treatments, but the Tenant refused them all.
13. The
Landlord’s obligation is to follow a reasonable program of maintenance.  It has
met that obligation.  It has tried to treat the problem but the Tenant refused
the treatments.  There is nothing further the Landlord could have done.
14. The
Tenant testified that her pest control technician told her that the Landlord’s
treatment methods were out of date.  That evidence was hearsay, and I give it
no weight.  Furthermore, even if the methods were out of date, they might still
have been effective if the Tenant had given them a chance.  She should have
given the Landlord the opportunity to solve the problem.
15. The
Tenant also feels that the problem could not be solved unless the Landlord
replaced her kitchen cupboards with new ones.  She feels that the cockroaches
were hiding in cracks in the cupboards.  There is no evidence before me to
support the assertion that the cracks would have had any impact on the
effectiveness of pest control treatment.  Furthermore, from the Tenant’s photos
the cracks appear to have been normal gaps in the interior fittings of the
cabinets.  There was no evidence to suggest that the gaps constituted
disrepair.
16. In
short, the Tenant decided not to let the Landlord treat her cockroach problem. 
Having made that decision, she cannot now blame the Landlord for the problem
having persisted.  She has not established any breach of the Landlord’s
maintenance obligations.
It is ordered that:
 
1.   
The Tenant’s application is dismissed.
2.   
The Board shall pay to the Landlord the amount
of $5,626.80 together with any accrued interest.
3.   
Unless the Tenant voids this order as set out
below, the tenancy is terminated.  The Tenant shall vacate the unit on or
before March 20, 2018.                                                        
4.   
If the unit is not vacated on or before March
20, 2018, then starting March 21, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 21,
2018.
5.   
The Landlord shall pay the Tenant $663.48, which
represents the rent deposit and interest owing on the deposit, less the rent
owing to March 9, 2018 and the Landlord's filing fee (Schedule A).  Against the
amount owing, the Landlord shall apply $37.10 per day in compensation for the
use of the unit from March 10, 2018 to the date that the Tenant vacates the
rental unit.                                                                                                        
6.   
This order will be void, and the tenancy will
not terminate, if the Tenant pays $1,300.39 to the Landlord or to the Board on
or before March 20, 2018 (Schedule B).                    
7.   
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 21, 2018 but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to
make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
