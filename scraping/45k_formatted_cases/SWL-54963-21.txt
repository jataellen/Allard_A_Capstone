In the matter
of:


304, 871 ADELAIDE STREET N LONDON ON
  N5Y2M2


 




Between:


2765749 Ontario Corporation


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Amelia Villa Ricard
Milek


Tenants



 
2765749 Ontario Corporation (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ricard
Milek and Amelia Villa (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay
the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on April 22, 2021 with respect
to application SWL-46342-20.
 
This application was heard by videoconference on January 14, 2022.
 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing. The Landlord was represented by Carmen Dawdy.
 
Determinations:
 
PRELIMINARY REQUEST
TO AMEND ORDER
 
1.    
At the beginning of the hearing,
the Landlord sought
an amendment to the
L4 application to remove the
Landlords “CANCO INVESTMENT PROPERTIES and JAMES
FERNANDEZ” and to add the new Landlord 2765749
Ontario Corporation, as the
property was sold in August 2021 to the new Landlord.
 
2.     The Landlord testified the amended L4 application was
sent to the Tenants as well in advance of the hearing as well as documents advising
all tenants of a
change in building ownership.
 
3.     The Tenants were not present
to provide their submissions to the Landlord’s request.
 
4.    
I
find that the amendment sought
by the Landlord will not prejudice the Tenants and the
Landlord’s request is granted to correct the record to reflect the current
Landlord.
 
L4 APPLICATION
 
5.    
This application was filed pursuant to section
78 of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act').
Applications of this nature normally result in the Board issuing an eviction
order without a hearing. However, this application was sent to a hearing
because the




 
alleged payments made by the Tenants
were unclear, hindering
the issuance of the ex parte order.
 
6.     The order provided that the Landlords could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain
condition(s) specified in the order.
 
7.     At the hearing,
the Landlord testified that as of the date of the L4 application (September 14, 2021), the Tenants failed to make the following
payment as outlined on order SWL- 46342-20 issued on April 22, 2021:
 
a)    
The rent in full on September
1, 2021; this amount was short paid by
$16.84.
 
8.    
The Landlord further testified that since this breach, the Tenants continued to breach by failing to pay the arrears of $190.40
on or before September 15, 2021. To date, the Tenants are also in arrears for
the rent for the period October 2021 – January 2022.
 
9.    
On January 17, 2022, interim order SWL-54963-21-IN was issued requiring
the Landlord to file a copy of
their account statement or ledger by January 19, 2022 which listed the payments
received and rent charged from April 2021 – January 2022, as the one submitted
at the hearing only included the period from September 2021 onwards.
 
10.  The Board confirms receipt of this statement. Looking
at this account statement, it appears that the Tenants made a lumpsum payment
on August 13, 2021 by paying the full amount of arrears, reaching
a zero balance; however, as of this date, the filing fee of
$186.00 remained owing to the Landlord,
which is not reflected on the account
statement.
 
11.  Based on the uncontested evidence
before me, I find that the Tenants
were in breach of
the order dated April 22, 2021; specifically, the Tenants failed to pay the
rent for September 2021 in full and on or before September 1, 2021.
 
12.  The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlords are entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and
compensation.
 
13.  The Tenants were ordered to pay $3,401.40
for rent arrears
and the costs related to the
Landlord's application fee in Order SWL-46342-20. The amount that is still
owing from that order is $186.00
and that amount is included
in this order. As a result, the previous
order SWL-46342-20 is cancelled.
 
14.  Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from September 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.
 
15.  The Landlords collected a rent deposit
of $825.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
16.  Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenants
for the period from May 9, 2020 to
January 26, 2022.




 
17.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of
the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA) and find that it would be unfair to
grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The
Landlord is unaware of any circumstances that would justify relief from
eviction.
 
18.  This order contains
all of the reasons for the decision
within it. No further reasons
shall be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SWL-46342-20 issued
on April 22, 2021 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlords and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before February 6, 2022.
 
3.    
The Tenants
shall pay to the Landlord
$1,777.20*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 26, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the
previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $27.68
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 7,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 6, 2022, then starting February
7, 2022, the Landlords may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords on or after February 7, 2022.
