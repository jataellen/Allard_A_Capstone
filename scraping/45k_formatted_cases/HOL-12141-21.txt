Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12141-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


BASEMENT, 88 HUDSON DRIVE BRAMPTON ON L6K4K8


 




Between:


Harminder Singh


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jasmine White
  Kevin Ishmael


Tenants



 
 
 
Harminder Singh (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Kevin Ishmael and Jasmine White (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 10, 2022. Only the Landlord
and the Landlord's Legal
Representative, Ibifiri Fabian, attended the hearing. As of 10:56 a.m., the Tenants were not present or represented at
the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from August 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective September 22, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $1,600.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,600.00
from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
I have considered all of the
disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it
would be unfair
to grant relief
from eviction pursuant to subsection
83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 20, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $8,521.26*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 9, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $52.60
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10,
2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
20, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 21, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 20, 2022, then starting
February 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed
to give vacant possession of
the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 21, 2022.
 
8.    
If, on or before February 20,
2022, the Tenants pay the amount of $11,386.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 21, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
February 9, 2022                                                                                 Date Issued                                                                       Fabio Quattrociocchi
