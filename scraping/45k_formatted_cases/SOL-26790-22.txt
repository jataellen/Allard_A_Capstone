Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26790-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


15,
  498 WEST STREET BRANTFORD ON N3R3W7


 




Between:


Jashim Uddin


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Alicia Keller Dylan
Morrison


Tenants



 
 
 
Jashim Uddin (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Alicia
Keller and Dylan Morrison (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the
Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition
specified in the order issued by the Board on August 31, 2021 with respect to
application SOL-21808-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants
have not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the
lawful monthly rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $2,614.92 for rent arrears
in Order SOL-21808-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $734.42 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
SOL-21808-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants
have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
It is ordered that:




File Number: SOL-26790-22
 
 
 
1.     Order SOL-21808-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$1,368.14*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $31.69
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 21, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenants will start
to owe interest. This will be
simple interest calculated from
February 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 31, 2022, then starting
February 1, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.
 
 
January 20, 2022                                                                              Date Issued                                                                       Kimberly

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order
relating to the eviction expires
on August 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before
this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
