Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: NOL-43493-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


1023 MORGAN ROAD CHELMSFORD ON P0M1L0


 




Between:


Stephanie Doyle


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Jay McGovern
  Jayden Kidd


Tenants



 
Stephanie Doyle (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jayden Kidd and Jay McGovern (the
'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on February 3, 2022. The Landlord, Landlord’s Legal Representative, Connor MacKay, and the Tenant,
Jayden Kidd on behalf of both Tenants, attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants
were required to pay for the period from May
15, 2021 to February 14, 2022. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of
Termination effective August 1, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The monthly rent is $1,800.00.
 
4.     The Tenants have made no payments since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants
for the period
from July 2, 2020 to
August 1, 2021.
 
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted
to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenants,
and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 22, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $13,320.51*, which
represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to
February 11, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the
rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$59.18 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 12, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
22, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 23, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 22, 2022, then starting February
23, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 23, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$15,486.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 14, 2022, or
ii)         
$17,286.00 if the payment is made on or before
February 22, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board
under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 23, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
