Review Order
 
 
An Le (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Caleb Leclair
(CL) and Jacqueline Leclair (JL) (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant
of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have
substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord
or another tenant;
and because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the
purpose of residential occupation.
 
This application was resolved by order SWL-43235-20 issued on October
4, 2021. On November 3, 2021,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard by videoconference on January 19, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant JL, and the Tenants’
legal representative C. Hall attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord’s request
for a review is based on the ground of serious error.
The Landlord submits that the
following two serious errors were made in the order:
 
•        
The Member erred in finding that
the N12 notice of termination was invalid because the Landlord testified
that her mother might not move into the rental unit as indicated in the notice;
and
•        
The Member erred in dismissing the application because
the Landlord did not
provide a declaration from her 16 year old son indicating that he intended to
reside in the unit with the Landlord, who is his mother.




 
2.    
At the review hearing
the Landlord stated that the Member’s finding,
at paragraph 2 of the order under review, that the Landlord
testified that she and her son would move into the unit immediately and that her mother
may move in later depending on her mother’s
needs and preferences was incorrect. However, I listened to the hearing
recording and the Landlord did give this testimony. After hearing this
testimony it was within the range of reasonable outcomes for the Member to find
that the N12 notice was invalid for stating that the Landlord, her child and
her parent intended to move into the unit. The Landlord’s testimony at the
hearing about whether her mother will move into the unit was equivocal. It is a
reasonable interpretation of s. 48 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 that
a Landlord must establish their good faith intention to move all of the people
listed on their N12 notice of termination into the unit. I therefore cannot
find that it was a serious error for the Member to dismiss the Landlord’s
application on this basis.
 
3.    
I believe it was an error for the
Member to dismiss the application on the basis that the Landlord had not filed
declarations by her son and mother. Subsection 72(1) of the Act requires that a
landlord file an affidavit or declaration from the person who personally
requires the unit. In this case the Landlord’s declaration indicates that she
personally requires the unit for herself
and some family
members. It is sufficient for the declaration to come only from the Landlord.
 
4.     However, the error dismissing the application for a failure
to file affidavits or declarations from the Landlord’s family
members is not a serious error because it did not affect the outcome. The
application was dismissed based on a reasonable finding that the N12 notice was
invalid.
 
5.    
The Landlord made other
submissions in her request for a review
but none of these
identified any errors in the order or in the process.
 
6.    
For the reasons above, on the basis of the submissions made in the request, I am not satisfied that there is a serious error in the order or that
a serious error occurred in the
proceedings.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
The request to review
order SWL-43235-20 issued on October
4, 2021 is denied. The order is confirmed and remains
unchanged.
