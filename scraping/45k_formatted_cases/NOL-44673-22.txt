In the matter of:      1, 422 KING STREET

Brandon Varey Kyla Bourcier


Tenants




 
On January 7, 2022, RWC
Management (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Brandon
Varey and Kyla Bourcier (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because
the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the
Board on November 25, 2021 with respect to application NOL-43535-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.    
I
find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order:
 
The Tenants
failed to pay to the Landlord $1,200.00 on or before
December 10, 2021 towards
rent and arrears (combined). The
Tenants paid $1,000.0 on December 11, 2021. This
amount has been applied towards December rent.
 
The Tenants
also failed to pay to the Landlord
$1,200.00 on or before December
17, 2021, December 24, 20021 and December 31, 2021 towards rent and
arrears (combined).
 
3.     The previous application included a request for an
order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered
to pay $4,636.00 for rent arrears in Order NOL-43535-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,636.00 and
that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order
NOL-43535-21 is cancelled.
 
5.     Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.




 
6.    
The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,000.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Order NOL-43535-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or
before January 31, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$5,868.19*. This amount
represents the rent owing
up to January 20, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $64.11
per day for compensation for the use
of the unit starting January 21, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the
unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
31, 2022, the Tenants
will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest
calculated from February 1,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.    
If the unit is not vacated
on or before January 31, 2022, then starting February
1, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 1, 2022.

The tenant has until January 30, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under
s. 78(9) of the Act. If the tenant files the motion by January 30, 2022 the order will be stayed and
the Board will schedule a hearing.

In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating
to the eviction expires on August 1, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is
located.
