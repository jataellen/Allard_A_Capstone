Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SOL-26770-22
 
 



In the matter
of:


102 VENTURA DRIVE
ST. CATHARINES ON L2R7H7


 




Between:


Pete Vanloon


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Neal Rowell Tammy
Rowell


Tenants



 
 
 
Pete Vanloon (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Neal Rowell
and Tammy Rowell (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the
rent they owe because the Tenants failed to meet a condition specified in the
order issued by the Board on January 5, 2022 with respect to application
SOL-24565-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The order provided that the Landlord could apply to
the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants
did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the
order.
 
2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following
conditions specified in the order: The Tenants
failed to pay $1400.00 towards
the arrears, on or before January
1, 2022. The Tenants failed to pay the lawful monthly
rent in full, on or before January 1, 2022.
 
3.    
The previous application included
a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order
required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to
eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of
arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.    
The Tenants were ordered to pay
$8,186.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application
fee in Order SOL-24565-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $8,186.00
and that amount is
included in this order. As a result,
the previous order
SOL-24565-21 is cancelled.
 
5.    
Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing
for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.




File Number: SOL-26770-22
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Order SOL-24565-21 is cancelled.
 
2.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before January 30, 2022.
 
3.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord 9,185.45*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 19, 2022 and the
costs related to the application fee for the previous application.
 
4.    
The Tenants
shall also pay to
the Landlord $52.60 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 20, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
5.    
If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before January
30, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from January 31,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
January 30, 2022, then starting
January 31, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction
may be enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after January 31, 2022.
