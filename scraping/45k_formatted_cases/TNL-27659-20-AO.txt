Between:

Landlord




 


and


 




 


Eurico Pedrosa
  Tinia L. Sylva


Tenants



 
604080 Ontario Limited (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
Eurico Pedrosa and Tinia L. Sylva (the 'Tenants') because
a)    
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
b)    
they have been persistently late in paying their rent.
 
This application was heard via
video/teleconference on June 10, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord's Legal
Representative David Ciobotaru attended the hearing. As of 10:28 a.m., the Tenants
were not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The applications are based on a N4 notice and a N8 notice to end the tenancy.
 
Relating to the L1 application for arrears of rent
 
1.     The Landlord served a N4 Notice of Termination because
the Tenants had not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period
from June 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020.
 
2.     The Tenants were in possession of the rental
unit on the date the application was filed by the Landlord with the Board.
 
3.    
The lawful monthly rent is $962.14.
 
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $962.14 from
the Tenant on January 13, 2016 and this deposit
is still being
held by the Landlord. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February
1, 2020/
 
5.     The Landlord submitted a L1 information update form setting
out that the Tenants paid
$11,900.00 after
the application was filed
and the total amount of the rent arrears
now owing up to June 30, 2021 totalling $4,647.08.




 
6.    
Based on the Landlord’s
uncontested evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that as of the hearing
date, the Tenants
owe to the Landlord up to the period
ending June 30, 2021, rent arrears of $4,647.08, plus $201.00 for the
Landlord’s cost to file the application - totalling $4,848.08.
 
7.     The Landlord testified that there have been prior
attempts for a negotiated repayment plan with the Tenants but was unsuccessful in reaching any form of a
final settlement. As a result, I am satisfied that the Landlord complied with their
obligations under subsection 83(6) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’).
 
8.     The Landlord is requesting a standard order for the arrears and to end the tenancy June 30, 2021.
 
Relating to the
L2 application
 
Persistent late rent payments
 
9.    
On June 15, 2020, the Landlord
gave the Tenants an N8 Notice of Termination with a termination date of
August 31, 2021 alleging that the Tenants
have persistently paid rent
late.
 
10.  This notice was issued pursuant
to paragraph 58(1)(a)
of the Act which says:
58 (1) A landlord
may give a tenant notice of termination of their tenancy
on any of the following
grounds:
1.  The tenant has persistently failed to pay rent on the date it becomes
due and payable.
 
11.  The month
lawful rent is $962.14, and rent is due on the 1st day of the month.
 
12.  The Landlord’s Representative submitted an updated
rent payment ledger documenting
that the Tenants have not paid the monthly rent on time since May 2020.
 
13.  I find the Tenants have persistently failed to pay the rent to the Landlord on the date it
was due.
14.  The Landlord’s Representative stated that if the
Tenants paid the total amount of rent arrears
outstanding to void the L1 application, the Landlord would be agreeable
to a 12 month pay on time conditional order.
15.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), including the impact of the COVID pandemic, and find
that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction based on a 12- month pay on time conditional order on
terms as set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of
the Act should the Tenants void the L1 Landlord’s L1 application.
 
16.  This order contains
all the reasons
for the decisions within the order. No other reasons will be issued.




It is ordered that:
 
Relating to the L1 application
 
1.     Unless the Tenants
voided the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated
effective June 30, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$3,356.79*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to June 30, 2021, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $31.03
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 1, 2021 to
the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $201.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before
June 30, 2021, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated
from July 1, 2021 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
June 30, 2021, then starting
July 1, 2021, the
Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 1, 2021.
 
8.    
If, on or before June 30, 2021,
the Tenants paid the amount of $4,848.08** to the Landlord or to
the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and
the Tenants could remain in the unit. If
this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
 
Relating to the L2 Application
 
9.     If the Tenants pay the amount required to void the L1
arrears portion of this order, the
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants will continue on the condition the Tenants
pay to the Landlord the lawful
monthly rent of $962.14 in
full and on time, on or before the
(1st ) day of each month for the next 12-month period
commencing July 1, 2021 through to
and including June 1, 2022.




10.  If the Tenants fail to make any one of her rent
payments in full and on time as set above in
paragraph 10, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act, without
notice to the Tenants for an order terminating the
tenancy and evicting the Tenants.
