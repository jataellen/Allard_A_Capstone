Ashley

Tenants



 
 
 
Harris Rahimi
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Ashley
Bourque and Eniafe Akinsuyi (the 'Tenants') and for an order to have the Tenants pay the rent they owe because the Tenants failed
to meet a condition specified in the order issued by the Board on June 10, 2021
with respect to application HOL-08562-20.
 
The Landlord's application was resolved
by order EAL-97288-21, issued on October
18, 2021. The Tenants filed a
motion to set aside order EAL-97288-21.
 
This motion
was heard by video conference on December 14, 2021.
 
The Landlord, the Landlord’s legal representative, L. Barder, and the Tenants
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord
alleged that the Tenants breached
order HOL-08562-20 because
they did not pay $1,055.00 to
the Landlord by August 20, 2021.
 
2.    
The Tenants
admit that they only paid $1,000.00 to the Landlord
by August 20, 2021, and therefore they breached order
HOL-08562-20, issued on June 10, 2021.
 
3.    
The Tenants
allege that their payment of only $1,000.00 instead of $1,055.00
on August 20, 2021, does not constitute a breach because
the Landlord failed
to honour paragraph 4 of the order HOL-08562-20. That paragraph provided that “In the event
that the Tenants can confirm the
October 2020 rent payment via ODSP cashed in the
amount of
$2,000.00 was received, then the Landlord
will deduct the amount from the arrears
in the payment plan in this
order.” The Tenants allege that the
Landlord did not accept their letter from ODSP, and they were therefore
justified to deduct $55.00 from the arrears




 
payment until
it added up to $2,000.00
that the Landlord
refused to deduct from the arrears.
 
4.    
The Tenants also allege
that they filed a request to reopen the application on the basis that the Landlord breached
paragraph 4 of order HOL-08562-20, and there has been no response with respect to that request.
 
5.    
The Tenants said that
they did not make the $1,000.00 arrears payment they had deemed was all that was owed to the Landlord after
September, 2021, because
they had by then received the eviction
order, and they were waiting for a
response to their request to reopen the application. They said that the eviction
order stated that the previous
order was cancelled, so they discontinued the arrears payments. They said that their rent payments for
October and November, 2021, were on time.
 
6.    
The Tenants said that
their income consists of ODSP of $2,400.00 per month and child tax credit of $2,400.00
per month. They have four children under
the age of 10, and they
have lived in the rental unit since February 2018.
 
7.    
The Tenants
said that they have looked
for another place
to live, and it is difficult to find a 4 bedroom house for $2,000.00 per
month, which is their current rent.
 
8.    
The Landlord said that
he never cashed a cheque for the rent for October 2020. He said that he had reached out to the Tenants multiple times
about the October 2020 rent. The
Landlord submitted into evidence a number of text messages
from late 2020 asking about the October 2020 rent. The Landlord said that the letter from
ODSP states that the cheque for October 2020 was
mailed out, but it specifically states that ODSP is not
aware of who cashed their cheque.
 
9.    
The Landlord said that
he has been before the Board multiple times in 2021 because of the Tenants.
He said that the Tenants
always find “loopholes” and they do not respond
to the Landlord’s messages. The
Landlord said that the arrears are substantial and he requests that the Board
lift the stay on the eviction order. The
Landlord said that he would consider granting the Tenants more time to find an
alternative place to live.
 
10. 
The Tenants
submit that they wish to remain in the rental unit, and they should
only pay
$1,000.00 towards the arrears on the 20th of the month,
rather than $1,055.00, until the
$2,000.00 rent payment from October 2020 is acknowledged by the Landlord.
 
Reasons and Analysis:
 
11.  The Tenants believe
they have a right to request a reopen of the application HOL-08562- 20 because the Landlord failed to honour his
obligation to deduct $2,000.00 for the October 2020 rent pursuant to paragraph
4 of order HOL-08562-20.
 
12.  In fact, subsection 206 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
‘Act’) relates to orders
under section 69 of the Act in cases where the Board makes an order based on
agreement to terms of payment without holding a hearing. In this case, the parties came




 
up with an
agreed payment plan. However, the
order was issued only after a hearing was held on June 3, 2021, where all parties
were present. The payment plan was issued as a consent order after a hearing
had been held.
 
13.  In any case, section 206(5)
permits either a landlord or a tenant to request
to reopen an application “within 30 days after the
order was made on the basis that the other party coerced them or deliberately
made false or misleading representations which had a material effect on the
agreement and the order issued under subsection (1).”
 
14.  The Tenants did not request their reopen
within 30 days after the order was made, as it was made on July 16, 2021, over
30 days after the order was issued on June 10, 2021, nor was the request
made on the basis listed
in subsection 206(5).
The Tenants did not
have the option to reopen order HOL-08562-20, and they did not meet the
criteria to reopen the application even if they had had the right to under
subsection 206(5).
 
15.  The Tenants unilaterally deemed they had
the right to deduct $55.00 from the agreed arrears payment, and they stopped making the arrears
payment at all after September, 2021.
 
16.  The Tenants owe a substantial amount of arrears and they have continued to
breach the payment plan they agreed
to in June, 2021. Consequently, I
find that the Tenants have not provided any basis for setting aside
the ex parte eviction order
issued on October
18, 2021. They did not give
evidence of any change in their circumstances since October, 2021, that would
substantiate why the order should be set aside.
 
17.  Having considered all of the disclosed
circumstances above in accordance with subsection 78(11) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the “Act”), I find that it would be unfair to set
aside eviction order EAL-97288-21, issued on October 18, 2021. In particular,
the Tenants are unlikely to pay the rent and arrears as they become due and
owing. The Tenants also believe
that they can unilaterally decide what payments
are, or are not, owed to the
Landlord, and it is prejudicial to the Landlord for the tenancy to continue.
 
18.  However,
considering the Tenants’
income and difficulty in finding an alternative place to
live, and considering the Landlord’s willingness to provide more time before
lifting the stay on the eviction order, I find that it would not be unfair to
provide the Tenants a bit more time.
 
It
is ordered that:
 
1.    
The motion
to set aside Order EAL-97288-21, issued on October
18, 2021, is denied.
 
2.    
The stay of order EAL-97288-21 is lifted on February 28, 2022.
