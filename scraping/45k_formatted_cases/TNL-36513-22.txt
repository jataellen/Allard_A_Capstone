Order under Section 78(6)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-36513-22
 
 
In the matter of:      1502, 99 BROADWAY
AVENUE
TORONTO ON M4P1V2
 
Between:                  Yanan Li                                    Landlord
 
 
and
 
Jennifer Beatrice
Wright                                                                                                                   Tenant
 
 
 
On January 12, 2022, Yanan Li
(the 'Landlord') applied in this L4 application for an order to terminate the
tenancy and evict Jennifer Beatrice Wright (the 'Tenant') and for an order to
have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant owes because the Tenant failed
to meet a condition
specified in the consent order issued by the Board on December 30, 2021 with
respect to L1 application TNL-34568-21.
 
Determinations:
 
1.       
The previous consent order provided in paragraph 4 that the Landlord could
apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if
the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.
 
2.       
I find that the Tenant has not met
the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1750.00 rent on or before January
1, 2022, which was
a breach of paragraph
3 of the consent order.
This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.
 
3.       
The previous L1 application included a request
for an order for the payment
of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the
Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in
addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to
request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.
 
4.       
The Tenant agreed and was ordered
to pay $8,936.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's L1 application fee in previous
consent order TNL-34568-21. The Tenant failed to make any payments towards that amount, so
$8,936.00 is still outstanding and has been added to this order. As a result, the previous consent order
TNL-34568-21 is cancelled.




 
5.       
Since the date of the consent
order, the Tenant
has failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January
1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.
 
6.       
On June 24, 2021, the Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $1,750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being
held by the Landlord.
 
7.       
Interest on the rent deposit is owing
to the Tenant for the period from the
date of collection, June 24, 2021 to
the date of this order, January 25, 2022.
 
It is ordered
that:
 
1.       
The previous consent order TNL-34568-21 is cancelled.
 
2.       
The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated. The Tenant must move
out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the
issuance date of this order).
 
3.       
If the Tenant made any payments
to the Landlord after this L4 application was filed on January 12, 2022, those amounts shall
be deducted from the calculations below.

Summary of Calculations
 
4.       
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $8,622.92*. This amount represents the rent owing up to this order date, January
25, 2022, and the costs related
to the application fee for the
previous L1application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on
the rent deposit.
 
5.       
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $57.53 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022 to
the date the Tenant actually moves out of the rental unit or gets evicted.
 
6.       
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
5, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
7.       
If the unit is not vacated
on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February
6, 2022, the Landlord may file
this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may
be enforced.
 
8.       
Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 6, 2022.

has until February
4, 2022 to file a motion with the Board to set aside the order under

stayed and the Board will schedule a hearing.

6, 2022 if the order has not been filed
