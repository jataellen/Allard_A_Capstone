Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: CEL-03377-21

In the
  matter of:


UPPER UNIT,
78 GRISELDA CRESCENT BRAMPTON ON L6S1M3


 




Between:


Michael Cunningham


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jody-ann Samuels


Tenant



 
 
 
Michael Cunningham (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jody-ann
Samuels (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit
or someone the Tenant
permitted in the residential complex
has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653# on February
10, 2022. The Landlord
and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
The Landlord filed two separate applications against the same tenant, at the same address, for the same reason. Both applications were heard together. As it was unnecessary to file two
applications, the cost to file the second application will not be awarded.
 
This order resolves both
applications.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Landlord claims
the Tenant has not paid utility costs. The notices
show the Tenant has not paid approximately
$3,000.00. The Landlord has made
these payments. The tenancy agreement
shows the Tenant is responsible for the cost of utilities.
 
2.     The Landlord served an N5 notice in January 2021. The Landlord
met with the Tenant to discuss this and the Tenant agreed to
pay. Despite this, the Tenant has not
paid any of these bills. The Landlord
has attempted to contact the Tenant by text and other means and the Tenant has
not responded.
 
3.     It is the Tenant’s position that there is a leak in a
tub causing a higher water bill. The
Tenant testified that this is the reason she is not paying.
She also testified
that she only resides in the upper unit and should
not be responsible for all the
utilities in the tenancy agreement.




 
4.    
The Landlord counters this by testifying there has not been another
tenant in the other
unit for 1 ½ years.
 
5.     The Tenant made no effort
to contact the Landlord after the notices
were served and has
made no effort to determine how much of these utility costs she is responsible
for.
 
6.     I find it unfair to the Landlord
to pay the costs the Tenant is responsible to pay.
 
7.     I find the Tenant has substantially interferes with a lawful
right, privilege or interest of the
Landlord.
 
8.    
I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act,
2006 (the 'Act'), and find that
it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of February
25, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 25, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
 
3.     If the Tenant
does not pay the Landlord
the full amount owing on or before
February 25, 2022, the Tenant
will start to owe interest. This will
be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
 
4.     If the unit is not vacated on or before February 25, 2022, then starting February
26, 2022, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
5.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after February 26, 2022.
