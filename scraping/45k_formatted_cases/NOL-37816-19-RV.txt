Review Order
 
 
Grant Lake Forest Resources Ltd. C/o Facts
Ltd (the 'Landlord') applied for an order
to terminate the tenancy and
evict Russell Overland (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of
the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has
substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege
or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date.
 
This application was resolved by order NOL-37816-19 issued on February
18, 2020. On March 12, 2020,
the Landlord requested a review of the order.
The request was heard on October
4, 2021.
 
The Landlord’s legal representative, Ian Frazier, and the Tenant
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord’s request
to review states that the Member erred in paragraph 3 of the order by finding that the Tenant voided the notice of termination signed February 13, 2019.
 
2.     While I agree that this is an error, it is immaterial
because the Landlord’s application is based on the notice of termination signed
June 25, 2019, with a termination date of July 15, 2019. As the application
is based on the notice of termination signed June 25, 2019,
it does not matter if the Tenant did or did not void the notice signed February
13, 2019. As a result, the request to review the order on this basis is denied.




 
3.    
The Landlord’s request to review states that the Member also erred in paragraphs 5 and
6 of the order, however the Landlord’s request to review is confusing in this
regard because it conflates
two separate notices
of termination: one signed June 25, 2019, and
one signed July 19, 2019.
 
4.    
The notice of termination signed
July 19, 2019 with a termination date of July 19, 2019 was correctly identified
by the Member as being invalid as per paragraphs 5 and 6 of the order. Again,
this determination is immaterial because the application was based on the
notice of termination signed June 25, 2019. As a result, the request to review the order on the basis of anything to do with the
notice of termination signed July 19, 2019 is denied.
 
5.    
With respect to the notice of
termination signed June 25, 2019 with a termination date of July 15, 2019 (the
notice upon which the application is based), the Member did not find any
deficiencies with respect to this notice. What the Member did find, as set out
in paragraph 3 of his order, is that the application was not filed within 30
days of the termination date as required
by the Act. It is ultimately upon this basis that the Landlord’s
application was dismissed.
 
6.    
The Landlord states in the request
to review that the Landlord’s application was initially filed on July 15, 2019, that the Landlord
failed to sign the application (which is required by section 185 (1) of the Act), that the
application was returned to the Landlord, and that the Landlord signed the
application and resubmitted it on August 19, 2019.
 
7.    
As a result, the issue to be
determined in this review is whether the order contains a serious error by
determining that the application was filed 30 days after the termination date set out in the notice of termination. Put another way, is it a serious
error to determine that an application is filed
when it is received by the Board without deficiencies rather than when it is first received by the
Board with deficiencies?
 
8.     Interpretation Guideline 8 - Review of an Order states that “A review
is not an appeal” and, with
respect to errors in law, it states:
 
The LTB will not exercise its
discretion to review an order interpreting the RTA unless the interpretation conflicts with a binding decision
of the Courts or is clearly wrong and unreasonable.
 
9.     Thus, while the standard of review on appeal is correctness, the standard to be applied
to reviews is not as stringent (i.e. conflicts with binding court
decision and/or clearly wrong and unreasonable).
 
10.  I am not aware of any binding Court decisions that
directly speak to the issue in this request
to review (i.e. is an application
considered filed when it is first sent to the Board
with deficiencies or is the application considered filed when it is received by
the Board without deficiencies).
 
11.  I understand
that some members consider an application to be filed when it first arrives
at the Board even if it contains deficiencies and that some members only
consider an application to be filed when it arrives at the Board without
deficiencies.




 
12.  As there are two well-established schools of thought
on this issue, I am not satisfied that the order under
review is clearly
wrong and unreasonable. There are two alternative lines of reasoning with respect to this issue and the order
follows one of these lines of reasoning. There are differing views on this
issue and both appear to be reasonable. As
such, it cannot be said under these circumstances that the order is clearly
wrong and unreasonable. The order’s interpretation of the issue is ultimately a
viable interpretation.
 
13.  While a reviewing
member might have decided a matter differently if they were the trier of
first instance, this is not the standard to be applied in a review.
Interpretation Guideline 8
- Review of an Order states:
“In making a decision to review, the LTB considers the public interest
in preserving the finality of its decisions together with the opportunity to
correct a serious error without the need to appeal or seek judicial review.” A
reviewing member should not overturn a reasonable decision simply because there
is an alternate reasonable decision that could have been made, even if it that
alternate reasonable decision appears more reasonable to the reviewing member.
 
14.  In light of the above, I do not find that the order contains
a serious error and the request
to review is denied.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The request to review is
denied.
