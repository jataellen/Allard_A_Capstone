Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12021-21
 
 



In the
  matter of:


30 BRENSCOMBE ROAD BRAMPTON ON L7A5E7


 




Between:


Farah Sami


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Lettesha Forsythe
  Mattieu Varin


Tenants



 
 
 
Farah Sami (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Mattieu
Varin and Lettesha Forsythe
(the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants
owe.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on January 24, 2022. The
Landlord’s Agent, Samiur Rahman, Landlord's Legal Representatives, Miria
Shepherd and Katherine Vandenberg, and the Tenant, Lettesha Forsythe, attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenants have not paid the total rent the Tenants were required to pay for the period from July 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 19, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenants are in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly
rent is $3,300.00.
 
4.    
The Tenants have made no payments
since the application was filed.
 
5.     The Landlord collected
a rent deposit of $3,300.00 from the Tenants
and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
6.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances
in accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA),
including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement
with the Tenant, and find
that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until March 1, 2022 pursuant
to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.




 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants
is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before
March 1, 2022.
 
2.     The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord
$18,693.33*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to February 8, 2022, less the rent deposit.
 
3.     The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $108.49
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 9, 2022
to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.
 
4.    
The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord
$186.00 for the cost of filing the application.
 
5.     If the Tenants
do not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before March 1, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe
interest. This will be simple
interest calculated from March 2,
2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
March 1, 2022, then starting
March 2, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after March 2, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenants wish to void this order and continue
the tenancy, the Tenants must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)          
$24,386.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 28, 2022, or
ii)         
$27,686.00 if the payment
is made on or before
March 1, 2022**.
If the
Tenants do not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and by the
appropriate deadline, then the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement
Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenants may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount
required under that subsection on or after March 2, 2022 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenants are only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
