Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: HOL-12335-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


334 SWEET
GRASS CIRCLE NEPEAN ON
  K2J5W9


 




Between:


Tariel Davidashvili


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Scott Gorry


Tenant



 
 
 
Tariel Davidashvili (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Scott Gorry (the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's
rent.
 
This application was heard in Passcode:
956 0593 7653#
on January 26, 2022.
 
The Landlord, the Tenant,
and the Tenant’s Representative, Lori Sheppard attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Tenant’s monthly rent is on the first day of the month. The termination date on the N8
Notice is January 1, 2022 which is not the last day of the rental period. This
renders the N8 Notice void because it doesn’t comply with section 58(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the
'Act').
 
2.     Even if I found the N8 Notice
substantially complies because
the end of the term on
the lease is January 1, 2022, the details on the Notice are insufficient
because it includes details about damage, unpaid rent and a bounced payment(s).
 
3.     Subsection 43(2) of the
Act states that a notice
of termination must contain “reasons
and details respecting the termination”. The Ontario Divisional Court in
Ball v. Metro Capital Property and Lockhurst (December 19, 2002),
Toronto Docket No. 8/02, found that subsection 43(2) of the former Tenant
Protection Act, which is very similar to the provisions in the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006, requires that a notice served upon a tenant must
include dates and times of the alleged offensive conduct with a detailed
description of the alleged conduct engaged in by the tenant.
 
4.     The details on the Notice are insufficient and do not establish or support the grounds of persistent late payments which also
renders the N8 Notice void.
