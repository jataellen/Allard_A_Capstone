Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


and


 




 


Donna Roberts


Tenant



 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the
'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Donna
Roberts (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant,
another occupant of the rental
unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the
reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or
another tenant.
The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
This application was heard via video/teleconference on November 25, 2021.
Only the Landlord’s Agent Catalina Ancuta and the Landlord's Legal Representative Jason Paine
attended the hearing.
As of 10:55 a.m.,
the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing
although properly served with
notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The application filed by the Landlord is based upon N5 notices
of termination given to the Tenant that alleges that the Tenants’
conduct and ongoing behaviour has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment of the property by the Landlord.
2.    
A
result of an earlier inspection of the rental
unit the Tenant was directed
to clean the rental unit from excessive clutter,
garbage and combustibles and that a follow up inspection would be conducted on
December 4, 2020.
3.    
On December 4, 2020 the Landlord
attempted to conduct
a suite inspection and was refused access.
4.    
On December 16, 2020 the Landlord
was able to conduct an inspection of the rental
unit and discovered that the Tenant had not declutter and or removed
excess garbage and other combustible material.
5.    
Under section 33 of the
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the ‘Act’), a tenant is responsible for the ordinary cleanliness of the rental unit, just as a Landlord
under section 20 of the Act
is responsible for providing and maintaining
a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of
repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety,
housing and maintenance standards.




6.    
On December 23, 2021 the Landlord
gave the Tenant a first N5 notice alleging the Tenant has not maintained the rental unit in
a ‘livable condition
and poses a health and safety risk not only to the Tenant
but to other Tenants of the residential complex.
 
7.     Subsection 64(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act states:
“A landlord may give a tenant
notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another
occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant substantially interferes with the lawful
right, privilege or interest of the landlord
or another tenant.”
 
8.     In a case such as this the onus rests with the
Landlord to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the conduct
of the Tenants and or a guest of the Tenant(s) substantially interferes with a lawful
right, privilege or interest of the Landlord and the other tenant(s).
 
9.     Section 64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2006,
(the ‘Act’) provides that the type of N5 Notice served by the Landlord is
void if the Tenants, within seven (7) days after receiving the notice stops
the activity or corrects the conduct/behaviour. In this case, the
N5 was served on December 23, 2021, which means the seven (7) day voiding
period ran from December 24, 2021 to December 30, 2021.
 
10.  The Landlord’s Agent
(CA) submitted a number of photographs
that she had taken in the
rental unit on January 8, 2022 that clearly showed that the Tenant had not corrected her behaviour of hoarding and did
not declutter the rental unit.
 
11.  Pursuant to section 68 of the Act, before serving a
second N5 notice of termination the Landlord must have previously been given a
valid first notice of termination with an opportunity to void the notice
within 7 days of it being given. It is only if this first notice is given and the conduct
resumes or a situation
arises that constitutes grounds for a notice
of termination within six months after the first notice was given that a
non-voidable N5 notice can be served.
 
12.  Based on the uncontested testimony
of the Landlord’s Agent I was satisfied that a valid first N5 notice had been given to
the Tenant , and on a balance of probabilities, I was satisfied that the Tenant
did not void the first N5 notice.
 
13.  The Landlord subsequently gave the Tenant
a non-voidable second
N5 notice to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant.
 
14.  The Tenant did not attend
the hearing to make submissions.
 
15.  Based on the uncontested testimony of the Landlord’s
Agent, I find the Tenant or an occupant of the Tenant's rental
unit has substantially interfered with the Landlord's
and the other tenants' reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and a
lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord and the other tenant.
 
16.  After having considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection
83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.




 
17.  The order contains
all the reasons for the decisions within the order.
No other reasons will be issued.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The tenancy between
the Landlord and the Tenant
is terminated, as of
February 28, 2022. The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before February 28, 2022.
 
2.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 28, 2022, then starting
March 1, 2022, the Landlord
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
3.     Upon receipt of this order,
the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 1, 2022.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.    
The Tenant shall pay the total amount owing**
to the Landlord on or before

6.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord

the unit to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
7.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing on or before February
28, 2022, he will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 1, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
8.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord
the full amount
owing* on or before February
28, 2022, the Landlord has the right anytime after March 1, 2022 to
collect from the Tenant the amount owing or any outstanding balance as a result
of this order.
