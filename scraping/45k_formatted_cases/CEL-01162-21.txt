Order under
Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act,
2006


 




 


File Number:
CEL-01162-21




 
In the matter
of:


 
2210, 3 KNIGHTSBRIDGE ROAD BRAMPTON ON L6T3X3


 




Between:


Capreit Limited Partnership


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Nadine Adassa Gordon


Tenant



 
 
 
Capreit Limited Partnership (the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Nadine Adassa Gordon (the
'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This application was heard by
videoconference on September
24, 2021.
 
Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, Jason Paine, attended the hearing. As of 10:13 a.m., the Tenant
was not present or represented at the hearing,
although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from
March 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Because
of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 28,
2021.
 
2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit
of $1,456.55 from the Tenant
and this deposit
is still being held by the
Landlord.
 
3.     Interest on the rent deposit
is owing to the Tenant for the period
from March 1, 2020 to June 28, 2021.
 
4.     At the hearing, the Landlord confirmed that the rent
arrears have been paid since September 21, 2021. However, a balance of $36.55 for the application filing fee is still outstanding.
 
5.     The Tenant failed
to attend the hearing and therefore the best available
evidence that is before me are the uncontested
submissions of the Landlord.




File Number: CEL-01162-21
 
It is
ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant pay to the Landlord

owing* on or before February
25, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 26, 2022
at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
