Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-55250-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


3,
1042 DUNDAS STREET LONDON ON N5W3A5


 




Between:


Citijen Realty
Investment Inc.


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Scott Fenning


Tenant



 
 
Citijen Realty Investment Inc. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Scott Fenning
(the 'Tenant') because
the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard by videoconference
on January 6, 2022. Only the Landlord’s Agent, Danh Tran,
attended the hearing.
As of 3:45 p.m., the Tenant was not present
or represented at the hearing although properly served
with notice of this hearing by the Board.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period
from September 1, 2021 to January 31,
2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of
Termination effective September 16, 2021.
 
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental
unit.
 
3.     The lawful monthly rent is
$825.00.
 
4.    
The Landlord
collected a rent deposit of $825.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still
being held by the Landlord.
 
5.    
Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant
for the period from May 7, 2020 to
September 16, 2021.
 
6.     The Tenant paid $2,904.00 after the application was filed.
 
7.     I have considered all
of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(RTA), including the impact of COVID-19 on the parties and whether the Landlord attempted to negotiate a repayment agreement with the Tenant, and find that it would be unfair
to grant relief from eviction
pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

It is ordered
that:
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below,
the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before
February 6, 2022.
 
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the
Landlord $283.66*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January
26, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.    
The Tenant
shall also pay to the Landlord $27.12
per day for compensation for the use of
the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00
for the cost of filing
the application.
 
5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount
owing* on or before February
6, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 7, 2022 at
2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before
February 6, 2022, then starting
February 7, 2022, the Landlord may file this order
with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be
enforced.
 
7.    
Upon receipt
of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give
vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 7, 2022.
 
8.    
If the Tenant wishes to void this order
and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must pay
to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)               
$1,407.00 if the payment
is made on or before
January 31, 2022, or
ii)             
$2,232.00 if the payment
is made on or before
February 6, 2022**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment
in accordance with this paragraph and by the appropriate deadline, then the
Landlord may file this order with
the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 7, 2022 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.
