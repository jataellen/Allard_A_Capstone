Order under Section 78(11)
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: EAL-99035-21-SA
 
 



In the matter
of:


7, 399 DIBBLE STREET
W PRESCOTT ON K0E1T0


 




Between:


Randy Jackson


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Jill Harkness


Tenant



 
 
 
Randy Jackson
(the 'Landlord') applied
for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Jill Harkness
(the 'Tenant') and for an order to have the Tenant pay the rent the Tenant
owes because the Tenant
failed to meet a condition specified
in the order issued by the Board on July 13, 2021 with respect to application EAL-94034-21.
 
This application was heard by video conference on February 7, 2022. The Landlord, the Landlord’s
spouse, A. Lancione, the Tenant's Legal Representative, L. Tranter, and the
Tenant attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.     Order EAL-94034-21 provided
that the Landlord
could apply to the Board under section
78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act')
without notice to the Tenant
to terminate the tenancy and
evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain conditions specified in the
order.
 
2.     The Landlord filed the application under section 78 of the Act,
but an order was not issued
as there were inconsistencies in the application, hence it was sent to a
hearing.
 
3.     The Landlord alleged that the Tenant failed to pay the
rent for the month of November 2021. Order EAL-94034-21 required
the Tenant to pay
portions of the outstanding arrears of $686.00 on a monthly basis until completely paid off
on January 15, 2022. The Tenant was also ordered
to pay the monthly rent in two installments on the 1st and 15th day of each month until
January 15, 2022.
 
4.     The parties agree that on
August 15, 2021, the Tenant paid all
outstanding arrears for the period ending August 31, 2021. The parties also agree that the Tenant
has no outstanding arrears for the period ending February 28, 2022.




File Number: EAL-99035-21-SA
 
5.     Based on all the evidence, the Tenant paid the Landlord
the full amount
owing for the period
ending August 31, 2021. The amount
paid represented all the rent that was in arrears under the tenancy agreement,
all the additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy agreement on
the date of the Tenant’s payment, and the filing fee for the application.
 
6.     The Landlord argued that the order also required the
Tenant to pay the monthly rent until January 2022 and since she failed to make
a payment on November 1, 2021, she was in breach of the order.
However, as contained
in paragraph 3 of the order, the consequences
of a
breach were termination of the tenancy
and payment of all outstanding arrears. As the outstanding payments were made on August 15, 2021, long before the alleged
breach, and the Landlord’s application was not based on allegations of persistent late payment of rent,
the Tenant satisfied the requirements of order EAL-94034-21.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Tenant has satisfied the conditions specified in the order issued by the Board on July 13, 2021 with
respect to application EAL-94034-21.
 
 
February 15, 2022
