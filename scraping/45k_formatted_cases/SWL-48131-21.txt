Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: SWL-48131-21
 
 



In the matter
of:


205A, 75 ANN STREET LONDON ON N6A1R1


 




Between:


Centurion Property Associates Inc


Landlord




 


 
and


 




 


Oluwatosin Oluwayemi


Tenant



 
 
 
Centurion Property Associates Inc (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy
and evict Oluwatosin Oluwayemi and Olukayode Adegboyega (the 'Tenants') because
the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.
 
This application
was heard in Passcode: 695 7516 4596# on January 28, 2022. The Landlord’s Representative, Robert Rose and the Tenant attended
the hearing.
The application was amended
to remove Alukayode
Adegboyega, the Tenant’s
guarantor, as a party, as reflected in the style of
cause.
 
Determinations:
 
1.    
The Landlord provided copies
of emails accompanied to the application that suggest the Tenant vacated on December 10, 2021.
There was another email attached the application that states the Tenant
‘skipped’ dated November 24, 2020. The email dated November 9, 2021 from the
Tenant to the Landlord’s employee, Timonthy Hitchcock indicates she vacated the
unit and left the key in her room. Based on the email coupled with the Tenant’s
uncontested testimony, I find the Tenant vacated the rental unit on November 9,
2020.
 
2.    
My oral decision at the hearing
is replaced with my final written decision
under the authority of the Statutory
Power and Procedure Act.
 
3.    
The Board can make an order under sections
69 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
(the ‘Act’) requiring payment of rent arrears and termination only against
a tenant in possession of the rental
unit at the time of the application in accordance with section 87 1(b) of the Act.




File Number: SWL-48131-21
 
4.    
The Tenant was not in possession
of the rental unit when the application was filed on November 18, 2020. I have no authority to make an order for payment of rent. This is not an application that was filed under Protecting
Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020 (Bill 184) (PTSCHA)
nor was a request made to amend the application.
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.     The Landlord’s application is dismissed.
