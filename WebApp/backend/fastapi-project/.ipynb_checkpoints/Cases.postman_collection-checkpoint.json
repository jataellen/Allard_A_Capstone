The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (the ‘L2 Application’). These applications were heard in [CITY] on July 5, 2018. Only the Landlord’s Legal Representative, DA, attended the hearing. As of 10:05 a.m., the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of this hearing by the Board. Determinations and Reasons: The L1 Application 1. The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 22, 2018. 2. The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 3. The monthly rent is $869.49, effective July 1, 2018. 4. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $854.57 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord. 5. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2018. 6. The Tenant paid $1,240.00 after the application was filed. 7. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act. The L2 Application 8. The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the rent on the date it was due. Specifically, the rental ledger submitted at the hearing confirmed that since September, 2017, the Tenant has consistently failed to pay the monthly rent in full and on or before the first day of the month when it was due. The Tenant’s payment history during this period consists of partial payments and payments made well after the first of the month. As of the present hearing, the Tenant remained in arrears of rent. 9. As a result, the Landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy at the end of the term of the tenancy on the basis of persistent late payment is allowed. 10. I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, including the request of the Landlord’s Legal Representative, and find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 11. This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and no further reasons will issue. It is ordered that: The L1 Application 1. Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 17, 2018. 2. As of the date of this order, the amount of the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,369.28*. 3. However, the Landlord is authorized to offset the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant: $28.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 7, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and $190.00 for the cost of filing the application. 4. The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order. 5. If the unit is not vacated on or before July 17, 2018, then starting July 18, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 6. Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 18, 2018. 7. If, on or before July 17, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $1,073.61** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. 8. The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount required under that subsection on or after July 18, 2018, but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord. The L2 Application 9. If the Tenant voids the order for eviction under the L1 Application pursuant to paragraph 7 of this order, then the following shall apply: a. The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on the condition that: i. The Tenant shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first day of each month, commencing August 1, 2018 and for twelve months thereafter up to July 31, 2019. b. If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 9ai above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant. The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 9ai of this order.
