Determinations:  1. The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \'Act\') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.  2.

The Tenants failed to pay $511.00 towards the arrears, on or before January 20, 2022.  3. The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.  4. The Tenants were ordered to pay $3,066.44 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord\'s application fee in Order TNL-34231-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,066.44 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TNL-34231-21 is cancelled.  5.

Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 9, 2022.  It is ordered that:  1. Order TNL-34231-21 is cancelled.  2. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 20, 2022.  3. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,714.89*. This amount represents the rent owing up to February 9, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.  4. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $39.79 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting February 10, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.  5.

Determinations:  1. The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \'Act\') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.  2. I find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order:  The Tenants failed to pay to the Landlord $350.00 on or before January 14, 2022 towards arrears of rent.  3. The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.  4. The Tenants were ordered to pay $9,190.78 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord\'s application fee in Order CEL-97276-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $4,640.78 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order CEL-97276-20 is cancelled.      5.

The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,487.84 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.  8. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from January 1, 2021 to February 4, 2022.  It is ordered that:  1. Order CEL-97276-20 is cancelled.  2. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 15, 2022.  3. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $4,839.63*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 31, 2022 and the total charges related to an NSF cheque tendered to the Landlord by or on behalf of the Tenants and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.  4.

Determinations:  1. The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \'Act\') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.  2. I find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenant did not pay $1654.08 on or before December 23, 2021.  3. The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.  4. The Tenants were ordered to pay $6,654.08 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord\'s application fee in Order SOL-18110-20. The amount that is still owing from that order is $1,654.08 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order SOL-18110-20 is cancelled.  5. Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from December 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022.      6. The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,407.25 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.  7. Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from May 1, 2021 to January 26, 2022.  It is ordered that:  1. Order SOL-18110-20 is cancelled.  2. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 6, 2022.  3. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,100.24*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 26, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.  4. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $44.82 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 27, 2022 to the date the Tenants move out of the unit.  5. If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 6, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest.

Determinations:  1. The previous consent order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \'Act\') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.  2. I find that the Tenants have not met the following condition specified in the order: The Tenant failed to pay the lawful monthly rent, on or before January 1, 2022. This was a breach of the consent order. This L4 application was filed within 30 days of the breach.  3. The previous L1 application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, in this L4 application the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.  4. The Tenants were ordered to pay $6,536.00 for rent arrears and NSF cheque charges and the costs related to the Landlord\'s application fee in Order TSL-23694-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $3,536.00 and that amount is included in this order. As a result, the previous order TSL-23694-21 is cancelled.      5. Since the date of the order, the Tenants have failed to pay the full rent that became owing for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022.  6. On December 1, 2017, the Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,418.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.  7. Interest was last paid out to the Tenants up to the period ending December, 31, 20202. Interest is owing on the rent deposit for the period from January 1, 2021 to this order date, January 25, 2022.  It is ordered that:  1. The previous consent order TSL-23694-21 is cancelled.  2. The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated. The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before February 5, 2022 (standard 11 days from the issuance date of this order).  3. If the Tenant made any payments after this L4 application was filed, those amounts shall be deducted from the calculations below.  See attached Summary of Calculations  4. The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,282.31*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 25, 2022 and the costs related to the application fee for the previous L1 application, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.  5. The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $46.62 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 26, 2022 to the date the Tenants actually move out of the rental unit or get evicted.  6. If the Tenants do not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 5, 2022, the Tenants will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 6, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.  7. If the unit is not vacated on or before February 5, 2022, then starting February 6, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.  8.

Determinations: 1.  The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \'Act\') without notice to the Tenant to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order. 2.

The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenant to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation. 4.  The Tenant was ordered to pay $9,950.00 for rent arrears in Order SOL-21917-21. The amount that is still owing from that order is $9,950.00 and that amount is included in this order.

Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 9, 2020 to January 27, 2022. It is ordered that: 1.  The previous order SOL-21917-21 is cancelled. 2.  The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before February 7, 2022. 3.  The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $11,046.90*. This amount represents the rent owing up to January 27, 2022, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit. 4.  The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $44.38 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 28, 2022 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit. 5.  If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before February 7, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest.
