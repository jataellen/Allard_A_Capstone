Order
under Section 69
Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File
Number: SWL-17348-18
 
CR
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SR
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 Application’).
 
The Landlord also applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been
persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent.  The Landlord also claimed
compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination
date (the ‘L2 Application’).
 
These applications were heard in [CITY] on
July 5, 2018.  Only the Landlord’s Legal
Representative, DA, attended the hearing.  As of 10:05 a.m., the Tenant was not
present or represented at the hearing although properly served with notice of
this hearing by the Board. 
 
Determinations and
Reasons:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the
Tenant was required to pay for the period from May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018. 
Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective
May 22, 2018.
2.     The Tenant is in possession of the rental unit. 
3.     The monthly rent is $869.49, effective July 1,
2018.
4.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $854.57
from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
5.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the
Tenant for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2018.
6.     The Tenant paid $1,240.00 after the application
was filed.
7.     I have considered all of the disclosed
circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential
Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') and find that it would be unfair to grant
relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.
The L2 Application 
8.     The Tenant has persistently failed to pay the
rent on the date it was due.  Specifically, the rental ledger submitted at the
hearing confirmed that since September, 2017, the Tenant has consistently
failed to pay the monthly rent in full and on or before the first day of the
month when it was due.  The Tenant’s payment history during this period
consists of partial payments and payments made well after the first of the
month.  As of the present hearing, the Tenant remained in arrears of rent.
9.     As a result, the Landlord’s application for
termination of the tenancy at the end of the term of the tenancy on the basis
of persistent late payment is allowed. 
10.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Act, including the request of the
Landlord’s Legal Representative, and find that it would not be unfair to grant
relief from eviction subject to  the condition(s) set out in this order
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1) of the Act. 
11.  This order contains all of the reasons in this matter and
no further reasons will issue.
It is ordered that:
The L1 Application 
 
1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out
below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before July 17, 2018.
2.     As of the date of this order, the amount of the
rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit exceeds the
arrears of rent and compensation the Landlord is entitled to by $1,369.28*.
3.     However, the Landlord is authorized to offset
the following amounts from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenant:
$28.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 7, 2018
to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit, and
$190.00 for the cost of filing the application.
4.     The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay to the
other any sum of money that is owed as a result of this order.
5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before July 17,
2018, then starting July 18, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit
to the Landlord, on or after July 18, 2018.
7.     If, on or before July 17, 2018, the Tenant pays
the amount of $1,073.61** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order
for eviction will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated
and the Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and
on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
8.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under
subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if she pays the amount
required under that subsection on or after July 18, 2018, but before the
Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord.  The Tenant is only entitled
to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the
Landlord.
The L2 Application 
9.     If the Tenant voids the order for eviction under
the L1 Application pursuant to paragraph 7 of this order, then the following
shall apply:
a.    The Landlord’s application for eviction of the Tenant is denied on
the condition that:
 
i.      The Tenant shall pay the full monthly rent on or before the first
day of each month, commencing August 1, 2018 and for twelve months thereafter
up to July 31, 2019.  
 
b.    If the Tenant fails to comply with the conditions set out in
paragraph 9ai above, then, within 30 days of the breach, the Landlord may apply
under section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy and
evicting the Tenant.  The Landlord must make the application within 30 days of
a breach of a condition set out in paragraph 9ai of this order.

Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-79722-17
 










 
 
 

T.I.L.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict B. (R.)
S. (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(the ‘L1 application’).
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant (the ‘L2 application’).
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on May 19, 2017.
 
Only the Landlord and the Landlord’s witness, T.G., attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
The L1 Application 
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective April 17, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending May 31, 2017, total $1,960.00.
3.      The
Landlord incurred costs as a result of filing the application in the amount of
$190.00 and is entitled to reimbursement for those costs. 
4.      At
the hearing, the Board indicated to the Landlord that the notice of termination
fails to identify the rental unit pursuant to the requirements outlined in
subsection 43(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2016 (the ‘Act’).
As the notice of termination fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of
the Act, the notice is invalid. 
5.      As
the notice was found to be invalid, the Landlord elected to pursue an order for
arrears of rent only. An order will issue accordingly. 
The L2
Application   
6.      The
Landlord says that the Tenant has substantially interfered with another
tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and has substantially
interfered with a lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord. 
7.      For
the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct has
substantially interfered with both the Landlord and the other tenant living in
the residential complex. 
8.      The
residential complex is a house. The Tenant lives in a bedroom in the basement,
another tenant lives in a second room in the basement and the main floor is a 3
bedroom unit that is currently vacant. 
9.      The
Landlord says that the Tenant constantly exhibits aggressive, argumentative and
inappropriate behaviour towards the other tenant, towards the Landlord and
towards anyone around him. 
10.   In
support of his position, the Landlord called the other basement tenant, TG, to
provide specific examples. TG provided the Board with multiple audio recordings
in which the Tenant can be heard yelling extremely loudly, threatening TG and
others around him, swearing, uttering racial slurs, and being belligerent,
confrontational and aggressive. 
11.   Both
the Landlord and TG say they have personally witnessed the Tenant conducting
himself in this way on multiple occasions on an almost daily basis both inside
the house and outside in the yard and garage. 
12.   The
Landlord provided the Board with a list of dates and specific examples which TG
had sent to him. The list contains 9 specific dates from September 2016 to
early March 2017, and descriptions of the Tenant threatening, swearing,
yelling, insulting, uttering racial slurs and uttering homophobic slurs towards
TG.  Both the Landlord and TG say that this is not an exhaustive list; the
Tenant continuously engages in this behaviour and has become impossible to
endure. 
13.   In
addition, the Landlord says that the Tenant’s behaviour has prevented him from
renting the main floor of the house. The Landlord says he is concerned that a
family might move into the 3 bedroom unit and then be subject to the Tenant’s
confrontational, threatening and belligerent behaviour. The Landlord says he is
currently suffering a financial loss because he is worried about the negative
effect the Tenant’s behaviour might have on any new tenants moving into the
house. 
14.   Based
on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Tenant’s conduct is
substantially interfering with both the basement tenant’s reasonable enjoyment
of his unit as well as the Landlord’s lawful right privilege or interest. As a
result, the Landlord’s application must be granted. 
15.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
It
is ordered that:
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before June 6, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,856.72*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to May 26, 2017.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $21.37 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting May 27, 2017 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before June
6, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from June 7, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before June 6, 2017, then starting June 7, 2017,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after June 7, 2017.

Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-80773-17
 










 
 
 

Mu.K. and
Me.K. (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict
S.B. (the 'Tenant') because the Landlords require the rental unit for residential
purposes and because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes. The
Landlords also claimed administration charges related to NSF cheques.
 
This
application was heard in Whitby on June 30, 2017.
 
Only
the second-named Landlords above attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
THE
APPLICATION FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from April 8, 2017 to July 7, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective May 28, 2017.
2.      The
arrears of rent owing for the period ending July 7, 2017 total $4,188.00.
3.      The
Landlords incurred costs of $190.00 for filing the application and are entitled
to reimbursement of those costs.
4.      The
Landlords
are also entitled to $20.00 to reimburse the Landlords
for charges the Landlords incurred as a result of a cheque tendered by or on behalf
of the Tenant which was returned NSF.
5.      The
Landlords
collected a rent deposit of $1,800.00 from the Tenant
and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
6.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 9, 2016 to
May 28, 2017 totalling $30.78.
7.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act. The Landlords are unaware of any circumstances
that would justify granting relief to the Tenant. 
THE
APPLICATION FOR LANDLORD’S OWN USE
8.      The
Landlords’ application for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the
Tenant based on the assertion that they require the rental unit for residential
purposes must be dismissed. The notice of termination served on the Tenant does
not meet the mandatory requirements of the Act.
9.      Subsection
48(2) of the Act says:
The date for termination
specified in the notice shall be at least 60 days after the notice is given and
shall be the day a period of the tenancy ends or, where the tenancy is for a
fixed term, the end of the term.  
10.   This
provision means that a notice of termination for landlord’s own use must
provide a date of termination that is the last day of the period of the
tenancy. 
11.   Here
the period of the tenancy is monthly and runs from the 8th day of
the month to the 7th day of the following month. This means the date
of termination on the notice must be at least 60 days after the notice is given
and fall on the 7th day of the month. The date of termination on the
Landlords’ notice is July 31, 2017.
12.   As
a result, the notice fails to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act and
that part of the application that is based on it must be dismissed. 
It is
ordered that:
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before July 16, 2017.
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $2,268.80*,
which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to July 5, 2017
and the total charges related to a NSF cheque tendered to the Landlords by or on behalf of the Tenant, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owes on the rent
deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $59.18
per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting July 6, 2017 to the
date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00
for the cost of filing the application.
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full
amount owing* on or before July 16, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe
interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from July 17, 2017 at 2.00%
annually on the balance outstanding.
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before July 16, 2017, then starting July 17,
2017, the Landlords
may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after July 17, 2017.
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords
or to the Board in trust:
i)        $4,398.00 if the payment is made on or before July 7, 2017, or
ii)       $6,198.00 if the payment is made on or before July 16, 2017**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after July 17, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlords.
The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once
during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
And section 21.1 of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act
 
 
File Number: TEL-81359-17-AM
 










 
 
 

F.I.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.G.
and T.B. (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the
Tenants owe.  This is an L1 application.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenants because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.  This
is an L2 application.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on July 7, 2017.
 
The Landlord and the second-named Tenant attended the hearing.
 
This amended order is issued to correct clerical errors in the
original order issued on July 18, 2017. 
 
Determinations:
L1
APPLICATION
1.     The
Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period
from May 7, 2017 to August 6, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective June 14, 2017.
2.     The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,850.00 from the Tenants and this
deposit is still being held by the Landlord.
3.     Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from February 8,
2016 to June 14, 2017.
4.     The
Tenant initially requested a repayment plan of 7 months by paying an extra
$500.00 a month.  After the Landlord said he did not agree with that length of
time, the Tenant said she would be able to make 4 payments in order to clear up
the balance of arrears.  
5.     The
Landlord stated he is experiencing hardship because he cannot pay his mortgage
due to the lack of payment from the Tenants.
6.     The
Landlord receives $1,150.00 of the monthly rent paid directly to him by social
services.  The Landlord is not without any payment, but the Tenants portion and
one full month of rent.
7.     The
second-named Tenant further stated there are 9 people living in the rental
unit.  Three adults and 6 children ranging in age from 1 year old to 13 years
old.
8.     I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to grant relief from eviction subject to  the
condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and 204(1)
of the Act.
L2
APPLICATION
9.     The
Landlord served the Tenants with a Notice of Termination for persistently
paying their rent late.  This notice was to have a termination date set out at
least 60 days from service and it must be the end of term.
10.  This
tenancy is a mid-month tenancy which begins on the 7th day of every
month and goes to the 6th day of the next month.  The Landlord
served the Tenants on May 30, 2017.  This means that the termination date
should have been at least 60 days after service and on the last day of the
term, which should be August 6, 2017.  The Landlord listed the termination date
as July 31, 2017, making this notice invalid.
11.  As a
result, the Landlord’s L2 application is dismissed; therefore no pay on
time order shall be issued beyond the last payment of arrears October 20, 2017.

It is ordered that:
 
1.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $3,349.00 for arrears of rent
to August 6, 2017 and costs.
2.     The
Tenants shall pay to the Landlord the amount set out above in paragraph 1 in
accordance with the following schedule:
a)    $824.75
on or before July 29, 2017;
b)    $824.75
on or before August 20, 2017;
c)    $824.75
on or before September 20, 2017; and
d)    $874.75
on or before October 20, 2017.
3.     The
Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord the monthly rent on or before the 7th
day of every month beginning August 7, 2017 until October 7, 2017.
4.     If
the Tenants fail to make any one of the payments in accordance with this order,
the outstanding balance of any arrears of rent and costs to be paid by the
Tenants to the Landlord pursuant to paragraph 1 of this order shall become
immediately due and owing and the Landlord may, without notice to the Tenants,
apply to the Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating
the tenancy and evicting the Tenants and requiring that the Tenants pay any new
arrears, NSF fees and related charges that became owing after August 6, 2017.

Order under Section
69
Residential Tenancies
Act, 2006
 
File Number: TEL-81405-17
 










 
 
 

G.C.
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict K-L.S.
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Lindsay on August 15, 2017.
Only the Landlord attended the
hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from June 1, 2017 to August 31, 2017.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective June 17, 2017.
2.      The Tenant
is in possession of the rental unit.
 
3.      The
monthly rent as of the date of the hearing is $830.00
 
4.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $830.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
5.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from April 28, 2017
to June 17, 2017.
6.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
1.    
Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy
between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of
the rental unit on or before August 28, 2017.
2.    
The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,296.84*, which represents
the amount of rent owing and compensation up to August 17, 2017, less the rent
deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $27.29 per day for
compensation for the use of the unit starting August 18, 2017 to the date the
Tenant moves out of the unit.
4.    
The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of
filing the application.
5.    
If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on
or before August 28, 2017, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be
simple interest calculated from August 29, 2017 at 2.00% annually on the
balance outstanding.
6.    
If the unit is not vacated on or before August 28, 2017, then
starting August 29, 2017, the Landlord may file this order with the Court
Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.    
Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after
August 29, 2017.
8.    
If, on or before August 28, 2017, the Tenant pays the amount of
$2,665.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction
will be void.  This means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the
Tenant could remain in the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on
time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff)
so that the eviction may be enforced.
9.    
The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11)
of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that
subsection on or after August 29, 2017 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Numbers: TNL-00793-18
TNL-01183-18



 


 


 



 
 
HL
and JL (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and
evict DC (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant
owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because he has been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord
also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after
the termination date.
 
These
applications were heard in Toronto on January 25, 2018.
 
The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.
 
 Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords
served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $750.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from October 30,
2015.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act for the application dealing with arrears of rent. 
 
 
5.      I
have also considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that, if the Tenant voids the eviction for non-payment of rent,  it would
not be unfair to grant relief from eviction for late payment of rent, subject
to  the condition(s) set out in this order pursuant to subsection 83(1)(a) and
204(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 16, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $719.65*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to January 31, 2018, after deducting the rent deposit
and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $24.66 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting February 1, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before
February16, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 17, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 16, 2018, then starting February
17, 2018, the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after February 17,
2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, he must pay to
the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $1,690.00 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)       $2,440.00 if the payment is made after January 31, 2018 but on or
before February 16, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after February 17, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.
 
10.   If
the Tenant voids the eviction portion of this order as permitted by paragraphs
8 or 9, the following provisions will apply:
 
a)    If
the Tenant has voided the eviction portion of this order by payment of
$1,690.00 on or before January 31, 2018, then he shall pay the rent for the
month of February on or before February 16, 2018.
 
b)    On
or before March 2, 2018 the Tenant shall pay the rent for the month of March
2018 plus the $190.00 filing fee that remains outstanding under a prior Board
order.
 
c)    From
April 2018 to and including March 2019 the Tenant shall pay the monthly rent to
the Landlords on or before the first business day of the month for which the
rent becomes due.
 
d)    If
the Tenant fails to make any one of the payments in accordance with paragraph
10 of this order, the Landlords may, without notice to the Tenant, apply to the
Board pursuant to section 78 of the Act for an order terminating the tenancy
and evicting the Tenant.

Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-00822-18



 


 


 



 
 
EGL
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict CG
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes
(‘L1 application’), and because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying
the Tenant’s rent. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the
Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date (‘L2 application’).
 
This
combined application was heard in Toronto on January 19, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s legal representative, BR attended the
hearing.  There
was no record before me of a request to adjourn and I was satisfied that the
parties had proper notice of the hearing.  After waiting more than 30 minutes,
I proceeded to determine the application on the basis of the materials before
me and submissions from the Landlord.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective December 22, 2017.
 
2.      This
is a monthly tenancy, and rent is due on the first day of each month.  The
evidence before me shows that the Tenant has not paid the full rent when due in
ten of the twelve months from January, 2017 to December, 2017.  I am satisfied
that the Tenant has been persistently late in the payment of rent.
3.      The
Tenant paid $1,400.00 after the application was filed.
4.      No
circumstances were disclosed to me to support relief from eviction in
accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, (2006) (the
‘Act’).
 
 
It is ordered that:
 
L1 application
 
1.     Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before February 2, 2018.  However, even if the Tenant voids the part of
this eviction order that relates to non-payment of rent, the tenancy will be
terminated as of February 28, 2018 for the Tenant’s persistent late payment of
rent.
2.     The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,359.11*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to January 22, 2018.
3.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $52.06 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting January 23, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
4.     The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
5.     If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before
February 2, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple
interest calculated from February 3, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance
outstanding.
6.     If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 2, 2018, then starting February
3, 2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
7.     Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 3,
2018.
8.     If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, she must pay to
the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)       $1,956.78 if the payment is made on or before January 31, 2018, or
ii)      $3,540.17 if the payment is made on or before February 2, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced. However,
the tenancy will still be terminated on February 28, 2018 because of the
Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent. 
9.     The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent if they pay the
amount required under that subsection on or after February 3, 2018 but before
the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only
entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement
with the Landlord.  However, the tenancy will still be terminated on
February 28, 2018 because of the Tenant’s persistent late payment of rent.
 
 
L2 application
 
10.   Even
if the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
the tenancy will still be terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental
unit on or before February 28, 2018.
  
11.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before February 28, 2018, then starting March 1,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
12.   Upon

Tenant



 
Oleg
Ovchinnikov and Victoria Ovchinnikova (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to
terminate the tenancy and evict Raheb Gholamreza Sadigh (the 'Tenant') because the
Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on March 26, 2018.
 
The Landlords, the Landlords’ representative, A.
Bon, the Tenant and the Tenant’s representative (friend) Ardalan Robati,
attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from February 15, 2017 to April 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective January 25, 2018.
 
2.      At
the hearing, the Tenant’s representative disputed the Landlords’ evidence of
the Tenant’s rental arrears.  The Tenant’s representative testified that he
loaned the Tenant $250.00 in February 2017, to help the Tenant
pay that month’s rent.  The Tenant’s representative gave evidence of his belief
that the Tenant paid the $250.00 balance of February 2017’s rent
to the Landlord.   
 
3.      The
Landlords’ ledger shows that the Landlords credited the Tenant with a $250.00
rental payment in February 2017.  The Landlords also testified
that they received only $250.00 for February 2017.
 
4.      The
Tenant did not give evidence of any rental payment in February 2018.
 
5.      I
prefer the Landlords’ sworn testimony of the Tenant’s $250.00 rental payment in
February 2017 over the Tenant’s representative’s evidence of his
belief of what amount may have been paid to the Landlords in February 2017. 
The Landlords’ testimony was based on their own memories of events in February
2017, and the testimony was supported by the Landlords’ business
record.
 
6.      The
Tenant’s representative confirmed that the Tenant paid $480.00 of the $500.00
monthly rent in April 2017.
 
7.      I
therefore find that the Tenant’s rental arrears for the period ending April14,
2018 are $5,270.00.  The Tenant’s monthly rent is due and payable on the 15th
day of each month.
 
8.      The
Landlords collected a rent deposit of $500.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlords.
 
9.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from September 16,
2015 to January 25, 2018.
 
10.   I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until April 30, 2018,
pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.
 
11.   At
the hearing, the Tenant’s representative requested an order requiring the
Tenant to pay the amount that he owes to the Landlord, by paying an additional
$100.00 each month with the Tenant’s rent.
 
12.   The
Landlords opposed relief from eviction.  The Landlords testified that, because
of a seriously ill grandchild, the Landlords have reduced their employment
activities.  The Landlords therefore rely on the Tenant’s rental payments to
meet the Landlords’ regular financial obligations.  Because of the Tenant’s
rental arrears, the Landlords have experienced financial hardship.  
 
13.   I
find that, under the circumstances, the Tenant’s proposal to pay the amount
that he owes to the Landlords is unreasonable.  The Tenant’s proposal would not
bring his account with the Landlords to a $0.00 balance within a reasonable
period of time.
 
14.   However,
the Tenant is a person with a disability, and the Landlords are holding the
Tenant’s last month’s rental deposit.
 
15.   I
therefore find that it is not unfair to postpone the eviction date to April 30,
2018.  This will give the Tenant time to either pay the amount that he owes to
continue the tenancy, or to find new accommodations.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlords
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 30, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $4,465.74*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $16.44 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 30, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing* on or before April
30, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from May 1, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlords may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlords, on or after May 1, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy, the Tenant must
pay to the Landlords or to the Board in trust:
i)        $5,460.00 if the payment is made on or before April 14, 2018, or
ii)       $5,960.00 if the payment is made on or before April 30, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlords may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after May 1, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlords. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlords.

Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-01839-18










 
 

HY
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict AS
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on March 26, 2018.
 
Although the Tenant signed the Board’s Hearing Attendance Record
form, the Tenant did not remain at the Board to participate in the hearing. 
Only the Landlord attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from December 15, 2017 to April 14, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective February 4, 2018.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $2,200.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from January 16, 2018
to February 4, 2018.
 
4.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.  The Tenant did not attend the hearing to give
evidence of the Tenant’s circumstances.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord
and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on
or before April 9, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $5,350.11*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 29, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $72.33 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 30, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $175.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
9, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 10, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 9, 2018, then starting April 10,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 10, 2018.
 
8.      If,
on or before April 9, 2018, the Tenant pays the amount of $8,975.00** to the
Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.  This
means that the tenancy would not be terminated and the Tenant could remain in
the unit.  If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may
file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the
eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or
after April 10, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the
Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the
period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.

            Order
under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-02075-18



 


 


 



 
 
JZ
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict VB
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.
 
The
Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the
Tenant because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the
Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused
undue damage to the premises. The Landlord has also applied for an order
requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage; and because the
Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in
the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable
enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another
tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained
in the unit after the termination date.
 
 
This
application was heard in Newmarket on March 28, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord attended the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the
period from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the
Landlord served a Notice of Termination.
 
2.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $950.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
3.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from February 1, 2015
to April 3, 2018.
 
 
4.      The
Tenant or an occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenant has
wilfully or  negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit 
by permitting a dog to urinate on the floor, walls and doors of the rental
unit.
This has
caused a strong odour to permeate the rental unit and the residential complex.
 
5.      The
Landlord has incurred and will incur costs of $1,638.50 including HST to repair
the damage.
 
6.      The
Tenant or an occupant of the Tenant's rental unit or a person permitted in the
residential complex by the Tenant  has interfered
with the Landlord’s reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex and the
Landlord’s rights by storing goods and scattering debris in the laundry room,
common areas and stairwells of the basement, outside the Tenant’s rental unit.
 
7.      The
Tenant did not correct the problem within the time period set out in the Notice
of Termination.
 
8.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
It is ordered that:
 
1.      The
tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must
move out of the rental unit on or before April 14, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $285.36*, which represents the amount of rent
owing and compensation up to April 3, 2018, less the rent deposit and interest
the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $32.88 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting April 4, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the
unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,638.50, which represents the reasonable
costs of repairing the damage caused by the Tenant..
 
5.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
6.      If

Order under Section 69
Residential Tenancies Act, 2006
 
File Number: TNL-02210-18










 

JSI
(the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BH
(the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes;
and because he has been persistently late in paying his rent. The Landlord also
claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the
termination date.
 
This
application was heard in Toronto on March 22, 2018.
 
Only the Landlord’s representative, BR, attended
the hearing.
 
Determinations:
 
1.      The
Tenant has not paid the total rent he was required to pay for the period from
December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord
served a Notice of Termination effective January 23, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent.  The Tenant has paid the
rent late every month since July 2017.
 
3.      The
Landlord collected a rent deposit of $855.00 from the Tenant and this deposit
is still being held by the Landlord.
 
4.      Interest
on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from December 5, 2012
to January 23, 2018.
 
5.      I
have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with
subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and
find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to
subsection 83(1) of the Act.
 
6.      The
Tenant did not attend the hearing to give evidence of the Tenant’s circumstances.
It is ordered that:
 
The Application for Non-payment of Rent
 
1.      Unless
the Tenant voids this part of the eviction order for non-payment of rent as set
out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The
Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 6, 2018.
 
2.      The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,559.25*, which represents the amount of
rent owing and compensation up to March 26, 2018, less the rent deposit and
interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.
 
3.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $29.12 per day for compensation for the
use of the unit starting March 27, 2018 to the date he moves out of the unit.
 
4.      The
Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $190.00 for the cost of filing the
application.
 
5.      If
the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before April
6, 2018, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest
calculated from April 7, 2018 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.
 
6.      If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 6, 2018, then starting April 7,
2018, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office
(Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
7.      Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after April 7, 2018.
 
8.      If
the Tenant wishes to void this order and continue the tenancy to April 30,
2018, when the tenancy will be terminated for the Tenant’s persistent late
payment of rent, she must pay to the Landlord or to the Board in trust:
i)        $2,860.00 if the payment is made on or before March 31, 2018, or
ii)       $3,745.64 if the payment is made on or before April 6, 2018**.
If the Tenant does not make full payment in accordance with this paragraph and
by the appropriate deadline, then the Landlord may file this order with the
Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.
 
9.      The
Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set
aside this part of the eviction order if they pay the amount required under
that subsection on or after April 7, 2018 but before the Sheriff gives vacant
possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion
once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord. 
The
Application for Persistent Late Payment of Rent
10.   If
the Tenant voids the part of this eviction order for non-payment of rent,
above, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of April
30, 2018, because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the rent. 
The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before April 30,
2018.
 
11.   The
Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $29.12 per day for compensation for the use of
the unit from May 1, 2018 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.
 
12.   If
the unit is not vacated on or before April 30, 2018, then starting May 1, 2018,
the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so
that the eviction may be enforced.
 
13.   Upon
receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to
give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after May 1, 2018.
